 - **Abstract**
 The most massive stars known to date are R 136 a1, a2, a3, and c within the central cluster R 136a of the Tarantula nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), with reported masses in excess of 150-200$M_\odot$. However, the mass estimation of these stars relies on the assumption that they are single. We collected three epochs of spectroscopy for R 136 a1, a2, a3, and c with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the years 2020-2021 to probe potential radial-velocity (RV) variations. We combine these epochs with an additional HST/STIS observation taken in 2012. We use cross-correlation to quantify the RVs, and establish constraints on possible companions to these stars up to periods of ~10 yr. Objects are classified as binaries when the peak-to-peak RV shifts exceed 50 km/s, and when the RV shift is significant with respect to errors. R 136 a1, a2, and a3 do not satisfy the binary criteria and are thus classified as putatively single, although formal peak-to-peak RV variability on the level 40 km/s is noted for a3. Only R 136 c is classified as binary, in agreement with literature. We can generally rule out massive companions (M2 > ~50 Msun) to R 136 a1, a2, and a3 out to orbital periods of < 1 yr (separations < 5 au) at 95% confidence, or out to tens of years (separations < ~100 au) at 50% confidence. Highly eccentric binaries (e > ~0.9) or twin companions with similar spectra could evade detection down to shorter periods (> ~10 d), though their presence is not supported by the relative X-ray faintness of R 136 a1, a2, and a3. We derive a preliminary orbital solution with a 17.2 d period for the X-ray bright binary R 136 c, though more data are needed to conclusively derive its orbit. Our study supports a lower bound of 150-200 $M_\odot$ on the upper-mass limit at LMC metallicity

 - **Abstract**
 It has been argued that heavy binaries composed of neutron stars (NSs) and millisecond pulsars (MSPs) can end up in the outskirts of star clusters via an interaction with a massive black hole (BH) binary expelling them from the core. We argue here, however, that this mechanism will rarely account for such observed objects. Only for primary masses $\lesssim$ 100 M$_{\odot}$ and a narrow range of orbital separations should a BH-BH binary be both dynamically hard and produce a sufficiently low recoil velocity to retain the NS binary in the cluster. Hence, BH binaries are in general likely to eject NSs from clusters. We explore several alternative mechanisms that would cause NS/MSP binaries to be observed in the outskirts of their host clusters after a Hubble time. The most likely mechanism is a three-body interaction involving the NS/MSP binary and a normal star. We compare to Monte Carlo simulations of cluster evolution for the globular clusters NGC 6752 and 47 Tuc, and show that the models not only confirm that normal three-body interactions involving all stellar-mass objects are the dominant mechanism for putting NS/MSP binaries into the cluster outskirts, they also reproduce the observed NS/MSP binary radial distributions without needing to invoke the presence of a massive BH binary. Higher central densities and an episode of core-collapse can broaden the radial distributions of NSs/MSPs and NS/MSP binaries due to three-body interactions, making these clusters more likely to host NSs in the cluster outskirts.
#### Probing the physics in the core boundary layers of the double-lined  B-type binary KIC4930889 from its gravito-inertial modes

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar evolution models of B-type stars are still uncertain in terms of internal mixing properties, notably in the area between the convective core and the radiative envelope. This impacts age determination of such stars in addition to the computation of chemical yields produced at the end of their life. We investigated the thermal and chemical structure and rotation rate in the near-core boundary layer of the double-lined B-type binary KIC4930889 from its four-year Kepler light curve, ground-based spectroscopy, and Gaia astrometry. We computed grids of 1D stellar structure and evolution models for different mixing profiles and prescriptions of the temperature gradient in the near-core region. We examined the preferred prescription and the near-core rotation rate using 22 prograde dipole modes detected by Kepler photometry. We employed a Mahalanobis distance merit function and considered various nested stellar model grids, rewarding goodness of fit but penalising model complexity. Furthermore, we found a preference for either an exponentially decaying mixing profile in the near-core region or absence of additional near-core mixing, but found no preference for the temperature gradient in this region. The frequency (co)variances of our theoretical predictions are much larger than the errors on the observed frequencies. This forms the main limitation on further constraining the individual parameters of our models. Additionally, non-adiabatic pulsation computations of our best models indicate a need for opacity enhancements to accurately reproduce the observed mode excitation. The eccentric close binary system KIC4930889 proves to be a promising target to investigate additional physics in close binaries by developing new modelling methods with the capacity to include the effect of tidal interactions for full exploitation of all detected oscillation modes.

 - **Abstract**
 The Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) three-dimensional correlation functions have been widely used to perform cosmological inference using the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale. While the traditional inference approach employs a data vector with several thousand data points, we apply near-maximal score compression down to tens of compressed data elements. We show that carefully constructed additional data beyond those linked to each inferred model parameter are required to preserve meaningful goodness-of-fit tests that guard against unknown systematics, and to avoid information loss due to non-linear parameter dependencies. We demonstrate, on suites of realistic mocks and DR16 data from the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, that our compression framework is lossless and unbiased, yielding a posterior that is indistinguishable from that of the traditional analysis. As a showcase, we investigate the impact of a covariance matrix estimated from a limited number of mocks, which is only well-conditioned in compressed space.
#### New insights in the bubble wall of NGC 3324: intertwined sub-structures  and a bipolar morphology uncovered by JWST

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of intertwined/entangled sub-structures towards the bubble wall of NGC 3324 below a physical scale of 4500 AU, which is the sharp edge/ionization front/elongated structure traced at the interface between the HII region and the molecular cloud. The sharp edge appears wavy in the Spitzer 3.6-8.0 $\mu$m images (resolution $\sim$2$''$). Star formation signatures have mostly been traced on one side of the ionization front, which lies on the molecular cloud's boundary. The James Webb Space Telescope's (JWST) near- and mid-infrared images (resolution $\sim$0.07$''$-0.7$''$) are employed to resolve the sharp edge, which has a curvature facing the exciting O-type stars. The elongated structures are associated with the 3.3 $\mu$m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission, the 4.05 $\mu$m ionized emission, and the 4.693 $\mu$m H$_{2}$ emission. However, the PAH-emitting structures are depicted between the other two. The H$_{2}$ emission reveals numerous intertwined sub-structures which are not prominently traced in the 3.3 $\mu$m PAH emission. The separation between two sub-structures in the H$_{2}$ emission is $\sim$1.1$''$ or 2420 AU. The intertwined sub-structures are traced in the spatial areas associated with the neutral to H$_{2}$ transition zone, suggesting the origin of these structures by ``thin-shell'' instability. Furthermore, an arc-like feature traced in the Spitzer 3.6-8.0 $\mu$m images is investigated as a bipolar HII region (extent $\sim$0.35 pc) at T$_\mathrm{d}$ $\sim$25-28~K using the JWST images. A massive star candidate VPHAS-OB1 #03518 seems to be responsible for the bipolar HII region.

 - **Abstract**
 Time-domain astronomy is progressing rapidly with the ongoing and upcoming large-scale photometric sky surveys led by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory project (LSST). Billions of variable sources call for better automatic classification algorithms for light curves. Among them, periodic variable stars are frequently studied. Different categories of periodic variable stars have a high degree of class imbalance and pose a challenge to algorithms including deep learning methods. We design two kinds of architectures of neural networks for the classification of periodic variable stars in the Catalina Survey's Data Release 2: a multi-input recurrent neural network (RNN) and a compound network combing the RNN and the convolutional neural network (CNN). To deal with class imbalance, we apply Gaussian Process to generate synthetic light curves with artificial uncertainties for data augmentation. For better performance, we organize the augmentation and training process in a "bagging-like" ensemble learning scheme. The experimental results show that the better approach is the compound network combing RNN and CNN, which reaches the best result of 86.2% on the overall balanced accuracy and 0.75 on the macro F1 score. We develop the ensemble augmentation method to solve the data imbalance when classifying variable stars and prove the effectiveness of combining different representations of light curves in a single model. The proposed methods would help build better classification algorithms of periodic time series data for future sky surveys (e.g., LSST).
#### Discovery of a one-sided radio filament of PSR J0538+2813 in S147:  escape of relativistic PWN leptons into surrounding supernova remnant?

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a faint radio filament near PSR J0538+2813 in the NVSS, CGPS, and the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey data. This pulsar is plausibly associated with the supernova that gave rise to the Spaghetti Nebula (Simeis 147). The structure is one-sided and appears to be almost aligned (within 17 degrees) with the direction of the pulsar's proper motion, but in contrast to the known cases of pulsar radio tails, it is located ahead of the pulsar. At the same time, this direction is also approximately (within 5 degrees) perpendicular to the axis of the extended non-thermal X-ray emission around the pulsar. No X-ray or optical emission is detected from the filament region, although the end point of the radio filament appears to be adjacent to a filament of H$_\alpha$ emission. We speculate that this structure might represent a filament connecting pulsar wind nebula with the ambient interstellar medium filled with relativistic electrons escaping the pulsar nebula, i.e. a radio analogue of X-ray filaments of Guitar and Lighthouse PWNs and filaments of non-thermal radio emission in the Galactic Center.
#### The effect of Jupiter on the CAI storage problem

 - **Abstract**
 By studying the distribution of calcium-aluminium-rich inclusions (CAIs) that are embedded within meteorites, we can learn about the dynamical history of the protoplanetary disk from which our Solar System formed. A long-standing problem concerning CAIs is the CAI storage problem. CAIs are thought to have formed at high temperatures near the Sun, but they are primarily found in carbonaceous chondrites, which formed much further out, beyond the orbit of Jupiter. Additionally, radial drift of CAI particles should have removed them from the solar protoplanetary disk several million years before the parent bodies of meteorites in which they are encountered would have accreted. We revisit a previously suggested solution to the CAI storage problem by Desch, Kalyaan, and Alexander which proposed that CAIs were mixed radially outward through the disk and subsequently got trapped in a pressure maximum created by Jupiter's growing core opening a planet gap. Our aim is to investigate whether their solution still works when we take into account the infall phase during which the disk builds up from the collapse of a molecular cloud core. We build a 1D numerical code in Python using the DISKLAB package to simulate the evolution of the solar protoplanetary disk, starting with a collapsing molecular cloud. We find that outward transport of CAIs during the infall phase is very efficient, possibly mixing them all the way into the far outer disk. Subsequent inward radial drift collects CAIs in the pressure maximum beyond Jupiter's orbit while draining the inner disk, roughly reproducing parts of the result by Desch et al. By introducing CAI formation so early, abundances out to 100 AU remain significant, possibly not consistent with some meteoritic data. It is possible to create a disk that does not expand as far out and also does not push CAIs as far out by using a very slowly rotating cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of pulsar scintillation are among the few astrophysical probes of very small-scale ($\lesssim$ au) phenomena in the interstellar medium (ISM). In particular, characterization of scintillation arcs, including their curvature and intensity distributions, can be related to interstellar turbulence and potentially over-pressurized plasma in local ISM inhomogeneities, such as supernova remnants, HII regions, and bow shocks. Here we present a survey of eight pulsars conducted at the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), revealing a diverse range of scintillation arc characteristics at high sensitivity. These observations reveal more arcs than measured previously for our sample. At least nine arcs are observed toward B1929$+$10 at screen distances spanning $\sim 90\%$ of the pulsar's $361$ pc path-length to the observer. Four arcs are observed toward B0355$+$54, with one arc yielding a screen distance as close as $\sim10^5$ au ($<1$ pc) from either the pulsar or the observer. Several pulsars show highly truncated, low-curvature arcs that may be attributable to scattering near the pulsar. The scattering screen constraints are synthesized with continuum maps of the local ISM and other well-characterized pulsar scintillation arcs, yielding a three-dimensional view of the scattering media in context.
#### Numerical studies on the link between radioisotopic signatures on Earth  and the formation of the Local Bubble. II. Advanced modeling of interstellar  26Al, 53Mn, 60Fe, and 244Pu influxes as traces of past supernovae in the  solar neighborhood

 - **Abstract**
 Measurements of long-lived radioisotopes provide a means, completely independent of other observational channels, to draw conclusions about near-Earth supernovae (SNe) and thus the origin of the Local Bubble (LB). First and foremost in this context is 60Fe, which has already been detected across the Earth and on the Moon. Using Gaia EDR3, we identified 14 SN explosions, with 13 occurring in UCL/LCC, and one in V1062 Sco, all being subgroups of the Sco-Cen OB association. The timing of these explosions was obtained by us through interpolation of rotating stellar evolution tracks via the initial masses of the already exploded massive stars. We further developed a new Monte Carlo-type approach for deriving the trajectories of the SN progenitors. We then performed 3D hydrodynamic simulations based on these initial conditions to explore the evolution of the LB in an inhomogeneous local interstellar medium and the transport of radioisotopes to Earth. The simulations include the stellar winds from the SN progenitors and additional radioisotopes (26Al, 53Mn, and 244Pu) besides 60Fe. We find that (i) our simulations are consistent with measurements of 60Fe, in particular, a peak 2-3 Myr before present, as well as 26Al, 53Mn, and 244Pu data, (ii) stellar winds contribute to the distribution of radioisotopes and also to the dynamics of the LB, (iii) the solar system (SS) entered the LB about 4.6 Myr ago, and (iv) the measured recent influx of 60Fe can be naturally explained by turbulent radioisotopic transport. Our simulations not only support the recent hypothesis that the LB triggered star formation in the solar vicinity through its expansion, but also suggest that the second, separate 60Fe peak measured at 6-9 Myr ago was generated by the passage of the SS through a neighboring superbubble (SB), possibly the Orion-Eridanus SB, prior to its current residence in the LB.
#### Comparison of distance measurements to dust clouds using GRB X-ray halos  and 3D dust extinction

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray photons from energetic sources such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be scattered on dust clouds in the Milky Way, creating a time-evolving halo around the GRB position. X-ray observations of such halos allow the measurement of dust clouds distances in the Galaxy on which the scattering occurs. We present the first systematic comparison of the distances to scattering regions derived from GRB halos with the 3D dust distribution derived from recently published optical-to-near infrared extinction maps. GRB halos were observed around 7 sources by the Swift XRT and the XMM-Newton EPIC instruments, namely GRB 031203, GRB 050713A, GRB 050724, GRB 061019, GRB 070129, GRB 160623A and GRB 221009A. We used four 3D extinction maps that exploit photometric data from different surveys and apply diverse algorithms for the 3D mapping of extinction, and compared the X-ray halo-derived distances with the local maxima in the 3D extinction density distribution. We found that in all GRBs we can find at least one local maximum in the 3D dust extinction map that is in agreement with the dust distance measured from X-ray rings. For GRBs with multiple X-ray rings, the dust distance measurements coincide with at least 3 maxima in the extinction map for GRB 160623A, and 5 maxima for GRB 221009A. The agreement of these independent distance measurements shows that the methods used to create dust extinction maps may potentially be optimized by the X-ray halo observations from GRBs.
