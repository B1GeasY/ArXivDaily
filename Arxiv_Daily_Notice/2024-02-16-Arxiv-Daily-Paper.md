 - **Abstract**
 We studied the multiband properties of two ultraluminous X-ray sources (2CXO J225728.9-410211 = X-1 and 2CXO J225724.7-410343 = X-2) and their surroundings, in the spiral galaxy NGC 7424. Both sources have approached X-ray luminosities L_{X} ~ 10^{40} erg/s at some epochs. Thanks to a more accurate astrometric solution (based on Australia Telescope Compact Array and Gaia data), we identified the point-like optical counterpart of X-1, which looks like an isolated B8 supergiant (M ~ 9 Msun, age ~ 30 Myr). Instead, X-2 is in a star-forming region (size of about 100 pc x 150 pc), near young clusters and ionized gas. Very Large Telescope long-slit spectra show a spatially extended region of HeII 4686 emission around the X-ray position, displaced by about 50 pc from the brightest star cluster, which corresponds to the peak of lower-ionization line emission. We interpret the HeII 4686 emission as a signature of X-ray photo-ionization from the ULX, while the other optical lines are consistent with UV ionization in an ordinary HeII region. The luminosity of this He^{++} nebula puts it in the same class as other classical photo-ionized ULX nebulae such as those around Holmberg II X-1 and NGC 5408 X-1. We locate a strong (5.5-GHz luminosity nu L_{nu} ~ 10^{35} erg/s), steep-spectrum, unresolved radio source at the peak of the low-ionization lines, and discuss alternative physical scenarios for the radio emission. Finally, we use WISE data to obtain an independent estimate of the reddening of the star-forming clump around X-2.

 - **Abstract**
 Previous attempts have been made to characterize the atmospheres of directly imaged planets at low-resolution (R$\sim$10s-100s), but the presence of clouds has often led to degeneracies in the retrieved atmospheric abundances with cloud opacity and temperature structure that bias retrieved compositions. In this study, we perform retrievals on the ultra-young ($\lesssim$ 5 Myr) directly imaged planet ROXs 42B b with both a downsampled low-resolution $JHK$-band spectrum from Gemini/NIFS and Keck/OSIRIS, and a high-resolution $K$-band spectrum from pre-upgrade Keck/NIRSPAO. Using the atmospheric retrieval framework of petitRADTRANS, we analyze both data sets individually and combined. We additionally fit for the stellar abundances and other physical properties of the host stars, a young M spectral type binary, using the SPHINX model grid. We find that the measured C/O, $0.50\pm0.05$, and metallicity, [Fe/H] = $-0.67\pm0.35$, for ROXs 42B b from our high-resolution spectrum agree with that of its host stars within 1$\sigma$. The retrieved parameters from the high-resolution spectrum are also independent of our choice of cloud model. In contrast, the retrieved parameters from the low-resolution spectrum show strong degeneracies between the clouds and the retrieved metallicity and temperature structure. When we retrieve on both data sets together, we find that these degeneracies are reduced but not eliminated, and the final results remain highly sensitive to cloud modeling choices. We conclude that high-resolution spectroscopy offers the most promising path for reliably determining atmospheric compositions of directly imaged companions independent of their cloud properties.
#### Probing the inner Galactic Halo with blue horizontal branch stars: Gaia  DR3 based catalogue with atmospheric and stellar parameters

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Stars that are found on the blue horizontal-branch (BHB) have evolved from low-mass stars that have completed their core hydrogen burning main sequence stage and have undergone the helium flash at the end of their red-giant phase. The fact that their luminosity is virtually constant at all effective temperatures also makes them good standard candles. Aims. We provide a catalogue of BHB stars with stellar parameters that have been calculated from spectral energy distributions (SED), as constructed from multiple large-scale photometric surveys. In addition, we update our previous, Gaia Early Data Release 3 catalogue of BHB stars with parallax errors less than 20% by using the SED results to define the selection criteria. Methods. We selected a large dataset of Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) objects based only on their position in the colour magnitude diagram, tangential velocity and parallax errors. Spectral energy distributions were then used to evaluate contamination levels in the dataset and derive optimised data quality acceptance constraints. This allowed us to extend the Gaia DR3 colour and absolute magnitude criteria further towards the extreme horizontal-branch. The level of contamination found using SED analysis was confirmed by acquiring spectra using the Ondrejov Echelle spectrograph attached to the Perek 2m telescope at the Astronomical Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences. Results. We present a catalogue of 9,172 Galactic Halo BHB candidate stars with atmospheric and stellar parameters calculated from synthetic SEDs. We also present an extended Gaia DR3 based catalogue of 22,335 BHB candidate stars with a wider range of effective temperatures and Gaia DR3 parallax errors of less than 20%. This represents an increase of 33% compared to the our 2021 catalogue, with a contamination level of 10%.

 - **Abstract**
 SMC X-2 exhibits X-ray outburst behaviour that makes it one of the most luminous X-ray sources in the Small Magellanic Cloud. In the last decade it has undergone two such massive outbursts - in 2015 and 2022. The first outburst is well reported in the literature, but the 2022 event has yet to be fully described and discussed. That is the goal of this paper. In particular, the post-peak characteristics of the two events are compared. This reveals clear similarities in decay profiles, believed to be related to different accretion mechanisms occurring at different times as the outbursts evolve. The H{\alpha} emission line indicates that the Be disc undergoes complex structural variability, with evidence of warping as a result of its interaction with the neutron star. The detailed observations reported here will be important for modelling such interactions in this kind of binary systems.

 Context. Knowing the rotation rates and masses of white dwarf stars is an important step towards characterising the angular momentum transport mechanism in their progenitors, and coupling the cores of red giants to their envelopes. However, deriving these rotation rates is not an easy task. One can use the rotational broadening of spectral lines, but there is another way to gather reliable information on the stellar rotation periods of pulsators: through studying the splitting effect of rotation on oscillation frequencies. Aims. We aim to derive stellar rotation periods in the TESS sample for as many white dwarf pulsators as possible. Methods. We rely on light-curve analysis of the TESS observations, and search for closely spaced frequency multiplets that could be rotationally split pulsation modes. We work with triplet frequencies, even if one or two triplet components are only marginally detectable. We also utilise ground-based observations available from the literature in an attempt to confirm the presence of several triplets. Results. We successfully identified rotationally split multiplets and derived rotation rates for 14 stars. The fastest rotators we identified have rotation periods of 6.6-10.0 h. The majority of the pulsators rotate with periods of 11.9-47.5 h, while we derived 85.5 and 93.2 h periods for the slowest rotators. In addition to providing stellar mass estimations, our results confirm previous findings that larger-mass WDs rotate faster than their lower-mass counterparts. We determine the rotation periods of four stars for the first time.
#### Curves of growth for transiting exocomets: Application to Fe II lines in  the Beta Pictoris system
 - **Authors:** T. Vrignaud, A. Lecavelier des Etangs, F. Kiefer, A.-M. Lagrange, G. Hébrard, P. A. Strøm, A. Vidal-Madjar

 - **Abstract**
 This study introduces the exocomet curve of growth, a new method to analyse the variable absorptions observed in $\beta$ Pictoris spectrum and link them to the physical properties of the transiting cometary tails. We show that the absorption depth of a comet in a set of lines arising from similar excitation levels of a given chemical species follows a simple curve as a function of the gf-values of the lines. This curve is the analogue of the curve of growth for interstellar absorption lines, where equivalent widths are replaced by absorption depths. To fit this exocomet curve of growth, we introduce a model where the cometary absorption is produced by a homogeneous cloud, covering a limited fraction of the stellar disc. This model is defined by two parameters: $\alpha$, the covering factor of the cloud, and $\beta$, related to its typical the optical depth. This model is tested on two comets observed with the Hubble Space Telescope in December 1997 and October 2018, in a set of Fe II lines at 275 nm. The measured absorption depths are found to satisfactory match the two-parameter curve of growth model, indicating that both comets cover roughly 40 % of the stellar disc ($\alpha=0.4$) and have optical thicknesses close to unity. Then, we show that if we consider a set of lines arising from a wider range of energy levels, the absorbing species seems to be populated at thermodynamical equilibrium, causing the cometary absorption to follow a curve of growth as a function of $gf \cdot e^{-E_l/k_B T}$ (where T is the temperature of the absorbing medium). For the comet observed on December 6, 1997, we derive a temperature of $10500\pm500$ K and a total Fe II column density of $(1.11\pm0.09)\times10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$. By probing the population of the highest excited energy levels ($E_l\sim25000$ cm$^{-1}$), we also estimate an electronic density of $(3\pm1)\times10^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Reconstructing sky models from dirty radio images for accurate source localization and flux estimation is crucial for studying galaxy evolution at high redshift, especially in deep fields using instruments like the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA). With new projects like the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), there's a growing need for better source extraction methods. Current techniques, such as CLEAN and PyBDSF, often fail to detect faint sources, highlighting the need for more accurate methods. This study proposes using stochastic neural networks to rebuild sky models directly from dirty images. This method can pinpoint radio sources and measure their fluxes with related uncertainties, marking a potential improvement in radio source characterization. We tested this approach on 10164 images simulated with the CASA tool simalma, based on ALMA's Cycle 5.3 antenna setup. We applied conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) for sky models reconstruction, then used Photutils to determine source coordinates and fluxes, assessing the model's performance across different water vapor levels. Our method showed excellence in source localization, achieving more than 90% completeness at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as low as 2. It also surpassed PyBDSF in flux estimation, accurately identifying fluxes for 96% of sources in the test set, a significant improvement over CLEAN+ PyBDSF's 57%. Conditional DDPMs is a powerful tool for image-to-image translation, yielding accurate and robust characterisation of radio sources, and outperforming existing methodologies. While this study underscores its significant potential for applications in radio astronomy, we also acknowledge certain limitations that accompany its usage, suggesting directions for further refinement and research.
