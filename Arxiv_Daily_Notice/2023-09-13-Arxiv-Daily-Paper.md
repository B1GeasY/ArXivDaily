 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter as scalar particles consisting of multiple species is well motivated in string theory where axion fields are ubiquitous. A two-field fuzzy dark matter (FDM) model features two species of ultralight axion particles with different masses, $m_1 \neq m_2$, which is extended from the standard one-field model with $m_a \sim 10^{-22}\,{\rm eV}$. Here we perform numerical simulations to explore the properties of two-field FDM haloes. We find that the central soliton has a nested structure when $m_2 \gg m_1$, which is distinguishable from the generic flat-core soliton in one-field haloes. However, the formation of this nested soliton is subject to many factors, including the density fraction and mass ratio of the two fields. Finally, we study non-linear structure formation in two-field cosmological simulations with self-consistent initial conditions and find that the small-scale structure in two-field cosmology is also distinct from the one-field model in terms of DM halo counts and soliton formation time.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper reports the first measurement of the relationship between turbulent velocity and cloud size in the diffuse circumgalactic medium (CGM) in typical galaxy halos at redshift z~0.4-1. Through spectrally-resolved absorption profiles of a suite of ionic transitions paired with careful ionization analyses of individual components, cool clumps of size as small as l_cl~1 pc and density lower than nH = 0.001 cm^-3 are identified in galaxy halos. In addition, comparing the line widths between different elements for kinematically matched components provides robust empirical constraints on the thermal temperature T and the non-thermal motions bNT, independent of the ionization models. On average, bNT is found to increase with l_cl following bNT \propto l_cl^0.3 over three decades in spatial scale from l_cl~1 pc to l_cl~1 kpc. Attributing the observed bNT to turbulent motions internal to the clumps, the best-fit bNT-l_cl relation shows that the turbulence is consistent with Kolmogorov at <1 kpc with a roughly constant energy transfer rate per unit mass of epsilon~0.003 cm^2 s^-3 and a dissipation time scale of <~ 100 Myr. No significant difference is found between massive quiescent and star-forming halos in the sample on scales less than 1 kpc. While the inferred epsilon is comparable to what is found in CIV absorbers at high redshift, it is considerably smaller than observed in star-forming gas or in extended line-emitting nebulae around distant quasars. A brief discussion of possible sources to drive the observed turbulence in the cool CGM is presented.

 - **Abstract**
 The first generation of haloes forms from the collapse of the smallest peaks in the initial density field. $N$-body simulations of this process suggest a prompt formation of a steep power-law cusp, but these calculations are plagued by numerical artifacts which casts some doubt on this result. Here, we develop new simulation methods based on the dark matter phase-space sheet approach and present results which are entirely free of artificial clumps. We find that a cusp with density $\rho\propto r^{-1.5}$ is indeed formed promptly, subsequently accreting a more extended halo and participating in the hierarchical growth of later halo generations. However, our simulations also suggest that the presence of artificial clumps just before peak collapse can significantly shallow the inner profiles of the cusps. We use $N$-body simulations with controlled amounts of small-scale power to place a conservative upper limit on the scales affected by artificial clumps. Finally, we used these results to simulate the collapse of the first generation of peaks of various types and in different cosmologies, finding prompt cusps to form in all cases. We conclude that prompt cusps are a generic feature of the collapse of peaks on the free-streaming scale of the initial density field, and their structure can safely be studied using $N$-body simulations provided care is taken to excise the region potentially affected by artificial clumps.

 - **Abstract**
 The scale of alpha-element yields is difficult to predict from theory because of uncertainties in massive star evolution, supernova physics, and black hole formation, and it is difficult to constrain empirically because the impact of higher yields can be compensated by greater metal loss in galactic winds. We use a recent measurement of the mean iron yield of core collapse supernovae (CCSN) by Rodriguez et al. (RMN23), $\bar{y}_{\rm Fe}^{\rm cc} =0.058 \pm 0.007 M_\odot$, to infer the scale of alpha-element yields by assuming that the plateau of [alpha/Fe] abundance ratios observed in low metallicity stars represents the yield ratio of CCSN. For a Kroupa IMF and a plateau at [alpha/Fe]=0.45, we find that the population-averaged yields of O and Mg per unit mass of star formation are about equal to the mass fractions of these elements in the sun. The inferred O and Fe yields agree with predictions of the Sukhbold et al. (2016) CCSN models assuming their Z9.6+N20 neutrino-driven engine, a scenario in which many progenitors with $M<40M_\odot$ implode to black holes rather than exploding. The yields are lower than assumed in some models of galactic chemical evolution (GCE) and the galaxy mass-metallicity relation, reducing the level of outflows needed to match observed abundances. For straightforward assumptions, we find that one-zone GCE models with mass-loading factor $\eta\approx 0.6$ evolve to solar metallicity at late times. By requiring that models reach [alpha/Fe]=0 at late times, and assuming a mean Fe yield of $0.7M_\odot$ per Type Ia supernova, we infer a Hubble-time integrated SNIa rate of $1.1\times 10^{-3} M_\odot^{-1}$, compatible with estimates from supernova surveys. The RMN23 measurement provides one of the few empirical anchors for the absolute scale of nucleosynthetic yields, with wide-ranging implications for stellar and galactic astrophysics.
#### A Minimal Model for Understanding Secondary Cosmic Rays

 - **Abstract**
 We take a phenomenological approach in a minimal model to understand the spectral intensity of secondary cosmic-ray particles like positrons, antiprotons, Lithium, Beryllium and Boron. Our analysis shows that cosmic rays at $\sim$ GeV energies pass through a significant amount of matter in regions surrounding the sources. This grammage decreases with increasing cosmic-ray energy and becomes negligible beyond $\sim 100$ GeV. During the subsequent propagation in the interstellar medium cosmic rays of all energies up to $\sim 10^5$ GeV/$n$ pass through about 1-2 g cm$^{-2}$ of matter before leaking into the intergalactic medium. It is in the interstellar medium that the bulk of the positrons and antiprotons are generated. Also cosmic-ray nuclei like C, N, and O at all energies generate additional amounts of Li, Be and B nuclei with a spectrum similar to those of C, O etc. The implications of these findings of the minimal model to the observations of gamma rays and also the importance of spatial and temporal discreteness of cosmic-ray sources for modeling cosmic-ray propagation are briefly pointed out.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop an analytic model for the mass of the first stars forming in the center of primordial gas clouds as a function of host halo mass, redshift, and degree of rotation. The model is based on the estimation of key timescales determining the following three processes: the collapse of the gas cloud, the accretion onto the protostellar core, and the radiative feedback of the protostellar core. The final stellar mass is determined by the total mass accreted until the radiative feedback halts the accretion. The analytic estimation, motivated by the result of the full numerical simulations, leads to algebraic expressions allowing an extremely fast execution. Despite its simplicity, the model reproduces the stellar mass scale and its parameter dependences observed in state-of-the-art cosmological zoom-in simulations. This work clarifies the basic physical principles undergirding such numerical treatments and provides a path to efficiently calibrating numerical predictions against eventual observations of the first stars.
#### Tracing Evolution in Massive Protostellar Objects (TEMPO) -- I:  Fragmentation and emission properties of massive star-forming clumps in a  luminosity limited ALMA sample

 - **Abstract**
 The role of massive ($\geq$ 8M$_{\odot}$) stars in defining the energy budget and chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium in their host galaxy is significant. In this first paper from the Tracing Evolution in Massive Protostellar Objects (TEMPO) project we introduce a colour-luminosity selected (L$_*$ $\sim$ 3$\times10^3$ to 1$\times10^5$ L$_{\odot}$) sample of 38 massive star forming regions observed with ALMA at 1.3mm and explore the fragmentation, clustering and flux density properties of the sample. The TEMPO sample fields are each found to contain multiple fragments (between 2-15 per field). The flux density budget is split evenly (53%-47%) between fields where emission is dominated by a single high flux density fragment and those in which the combined flux density of fainter objects dominates. The fragmentation scales observed in most fields are not comparable with the thermal Jeans length, $\lambda_J$, being larger in the majority of cases, suggestive of some non-thermal mechanism. A tentative evolutionary trend is seen between luminosity of the clump and the `spectral line richness' of the TEMPO fields; with 6.7GHz maser associated fields found to be lower luminosity and more line rich. This work also describes a method of line-free continuum channel selection within ALMA data and a generalised approach used to distinguishing sources which are potentially star-forming from those which are not, utilising interferometric visibility properties.
#### Detection of the extended $γ$-ray emission around supernova remnant  DA 530 with Fermi-LAT

 - **Abstract**
 We report the extended GeV $\gamma$-ray emission around the high Galactic latitude supernova remnant (SNR) DA 530 with the PASS 8 data recorded by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT). The $\gamma$-ray spectrum in the energy range of 100 MeV - 1 TeV follows a power law model with an index of 2.23. The much more extended $\gamma$-ray emission than the radio shell of DA 530 and the spatial coincidence with the molecular cloud suggest that the $\gamma$-ray emission could be originated from the hadronic process, where the high energy protons are accelerated in and escaped from the shock of DA 530. With a steady-state injection model of protons, the $\gamma$-ray spectrum can be well fitted with the typical Galactic value for diffusion coefficient and the low energy content of the total escaped protons.

 - **Abstract**
 This chapter discusses three nucleosynthesis processes involved in producing heavy nuclei beyond the iron group that are influenced or shaped by neutrino interactions: the v process, the vp process and the r process. These processes are all related to explosive events involving compact objects, such as core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers, where an abundant amount of neutrinos are emitted. The interactions of the neutrinos with nucleons and nuclei through both charged-current and neutral-current reactions play a crucial role in the nucleosynthesis processes. During the propagation of neutrinos inside the nucleosynthesis sites, neutrinos may undergo flavor oscillations that can also potentially affect the nucleosynthesis yields. Here we provide a general overview of the possible effects of neutrinos and neutrino flavor conversions on these three heavy-element nucleosynthesis processes.
#### Saturn's Atmosphere in Northern Summer Revealed by JWST/MIRI

 - **Abstract**
 Saturn's northern summertime hemisphere was mapped by JWST/MIRI (4.9-27.9 $\mu$m) in November 2022, tracing the seasonal evolution of temperatures, aerosols, and chemical species in the five years since the end of the Cassini mission. The spectral region between reflected sunlight and thermal emission (5.1-6.8 $\mu$m) is mapped for the first time, enabling retrievals of phosphine, ammonia, and water, alongside a system of two aerosol layers (an upper tropospheric haze $p<0.3$ bars, and a deeper cloud layer at 1-2 bars). Ammonia displays substantial equatorial enrichment, suggesting similar dynamical processes to those found in Jupiter's equatorial zone. Saturn's North Polar Stratospheric Vortex has warmed since 2017, entrained by westward winds at $p<10$ mbar, and exhibits localised enhancements in several hydrocarbons. The strongest latitudinal temperature gradients are co-located with the peaks of the zonal winds, implying wind decay with altitude. Reflectivity contrasts at 5-6 $\mu$m compare favourably with albedo contrasts observed by Hubble, and several discrete vortices are observed. A warm equatorial stratospheric band in 2022 is not consistent with a 15-year repeatability for the equatorial oscillation. A stacked system of windshear zones dominates Saturn's equatorial stratosphere, and implies a westward equatorial jet near 1-5 mbar at this epoch. Lower stratospheric temperatures, and local minima in the distributions of several hydrocarbons, imply low-latitude upwelling and a reversal of Saturn's interhemispheric circulation since equinox. Latitudinal distributions of stratospheric ethylene, benzene, methyl and carbon dioxide are presented for the first time, and we report the first detection of propane bands in the 8-11 $\mu$m region.
#### Grain Growth and Dust Segregation Revealed by Multi-wavelength Analysis  of the Class I Protostellar Disk WL 17

 - **Abstract**
 The first step toward planet formation is grain growth from (sub-)micrometer to millimeter/centimeter sizes. Grain growth has been reported not only in Class II protoplanetary disks but also in Class 0/I protostellar envelopes. However, early-stage grain growth occurring in Class 0/I stages has rarely been observed on the protostellar disk scale. Here we present the results from the ALMA Band 3 ($\lambda$ = 3.1 mm) and 7 ($\lambda$ = 0.87 mm) archival data of the Class I protostellar disk WL 17 in the $\rho$ Ophiuchus molecular cloud. Disk substructures are found in both bands, but they are different: while a central hole and a symmetric ring appear in Band 3, an off-center hole and an asymmetric ring are shown in Band 7. Furthermore, we obtain an asymmetric spectral index map with a low mean value of $\alpha$ = 2.28 $\pm$ 0.02, suggestive of grain growth and dust segregation on the protostellar disk scale. Our radiative transfer modeling verifies these two features by demonstrating that 10 cm-sized large grains are symmetrically distributed, whereas 10 $\mu$m-sized small grains are asymmetrically distributed. Also, the analysis shows that the disk is expected to be massive and gravitationally unstable. We thus suggest a single Jupiter-mass protoplanet formed by gravitational instability as the origin of the ring-like structure, grain growth, and dust segregation identified in WL 17.

 - **Abstract**
 MCG-5-23-16 is a Seyfert 1.9 galaxy at redshift z=0.00849. We analyse here the X-ray spectra obtained with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data, which are the first contemporaneous observations with these two X-ray telescopes. Two reflection features, producing a narrow core and a broad component of the Fe K$\alpha$, are clearly detected in the data. The analysis of the broad iron line shows evidence of a truncated disc with inner radius $R_{\rm in}=40^{+23}_{-16}$ $R_g$ and an inclination of $41^{+9}_{-10}$ $^\circ$. The high quality of the NuSTAR observations allows us to measure a high energy cut-off at $E_{\rm cut}=131^{+10}_{-9}$ keV. We also analyse the RGS spectrum, finding that the soft X-ray emission is produced by two photoionised plasma emission regions, with different ionisation parameters and similar column densities. Remarkably, the source only shows moderate continuum flux variability, keeping the spectral shape roughly constant in a time scale of $\sim20$ years.
#### Co-moving groups around massive stars in the Nuclear Stellar Disk

 - **Abstract**
 During the last $\sim$ 30 Myr the nuclear stellar disk in the Galactic center has been the most prolific star forming region of the Milky Way when averaged by volume. Remarkably, the combined mass of the only three clusters present today in the nuclear stellar disk adds up to only $\sim$10\% of the total expected mass of young stars formed in this period. Several causes could explain this apparent absence of clusters and stellar associations. The stellar density in the area is so high that only the most massive clusters would be detectable against the dense background of stars. The extreme tidal forces reigning in the Galactic center could dissolve even the most massive of the clusters in just a few Myr. Close encounters with one of the massive molecular clouds, that are abundant in the nuclear stellar disk, can also rapidly make any massive cluster or stellar association dissolve beyond recognition. However, traces of some dissolving young clusters/associations could still be detectable as co-moving groups. It is our aim to identify so far unknown clusters or groups of young stars in the Galactic Center. We focus our search on known, spectroscopically identified massive young stars to see whether they can pinpoint such structures. We created an algorithm to detect over-densities in the five-dimensional space spanned by proper-motion, position on the plane of the sky and line-of-sight distances, using reddening as a proxy for the latter. Since co-moving groups must be young in this environment, proper motions provide a good means to search for young stars in the Galactic center. We found four co-moving groups around massive stars, two of which are very close in position and velocity to the Arches' most likely orbit
