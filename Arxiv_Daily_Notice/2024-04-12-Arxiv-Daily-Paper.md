 Most stars form in clusters and groups rather than in isolation. We present $\lesssim 5^{\prime\prime}$ angular resolution ($\sim 2000$ au, or 0.01 pc) Very Large Array NH$_3$ (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3) and 1.3 cm continuum emission observations of the dense gas within the Serpens South protocluster and extended filaments to the north and south. We identify 94 dense cores using a dendrogram analysis of the NH$_3$ (1,1) integrated intensity. Gas temperatures $T_K$ and non-thermal linewidths $\sigma_\mathrm{NT}$ both increase towards the centre of the young stellar cluster, in the dense gas generally and in the cores specifically. We find that most cores (54\%) are super-virial, with gravitationally bound cores located primarily in the filaments. Cores in the protocluster have higher virial parameters by a factor $\sim 1.7$, driven primarily by the increased core $\sigma_\mathrm{NT}$ values. These cores cannot collapse to form stars unless they accrete additional mass or their core internal motions are reduced. The southern filament shows a significant velocity gradient previously interpreted as mass flow toward the cluster. We find more complex kinematics in the northern filament. We find a strong correlation between $\sigma_\mathrm{NT}$ and $T_K$, and argue that the enhanced temperatures and non-thermal motions are due to mechanical heating and interaction between the protocluster-driven outflows and the dense gas. Filament-led accretion may also contribute to the increased $\sigma_\mathrm{NT}$ values. Assuming a constant fraction of core mass ends up in the young stars, future star formation in the Serpens South protocluster will shift to higher masses by a factor $\sim 2$.

 - **Abstract**
 Given the important role turbulence plays in the settling and growth of dust grains in protoplanetary disks, it is crucial that we determine whether these disks are turbulent and to what extent. Protoplanetary disks are weakly ionized near the mid-plane, which has led to a paradigm in which largely laminar magnetic field structures prevail deeper in the disk, with angular momentum being transported via magnetically launched winds. Yet, there has been little exploration on the precise behavior of the gas within the bulk of the disk. We carry out 3D, local shearing box simulations that include all three low-ionization effects (Ohmic diffusion, ambipolar diffusion, and the Hall effect) to probe the nature of magnetically driven gas dynamics 1-30 AU from the central star. We find that gas turbulence can persist with a generous yet physically motivated ionization prescription (order unity Elsasser numbers). The gas velocity fluctuations range from 0.03-0.09 of the sound speed $c_s$ at the disk mid-plane to $\sim c_s$ near the disk surface, and are dependent on the initial magnetic field strength. However, the turbulent velocities do not appear to be strongly dependent on the field polarity, and thus appear to be insensitive to the Hall effect. The mid-plane turbulence has the potential to drive dust grains to collision velocities exceeding their fragmentation limit, and likely reduces the efficacy of particle clumping in the mid-plane, though it remains to be seen if this level of turbulence persists in disks with lower ionization levels.

 - **Abstract**
 Methanol masers at 6.7~GHz are well-known signposts of high-mass star-forming regions. [...] We aim to understand the origin of the ring-like structures outlined by methanol maser emission in a number of sources. This emission could be, a priori, spatially associated with an outflow and/or disc around a high-mass protostar. [...] Using sensitive, three-epoch observations spanning over eight years with the European VLBI Network, we have started the most direct investigations of maser rings using very accurate proper motion measurements with uncertainties below 1\,km~s$^{-1}$. We present full results for the five targets of our sample, G23.207-00.377, G23.389+00.185, G28.817+00.365, G31.047+00.356, and G31.581+00.077, where proper motions show similar characteristics; maser cloudlets do not move inwards towards the centre of the rings but rather outwards. We also include the most circular source, G23.657-00.127, in the discussion as a reference. The magnitude of maser proper motions ranges from a maximum of about 13\,km~s$^{-1}$ to 0.5~km~s$^{-1}$. In two of the five sources with a high number of maser spots (>100), namely G23.207-00.377 and G23.389+00.185, we show that the size of the best elliptical model, fitted to the distribution of persistent masers, increases in time in a manner similar to the case of G23.657-00.127. Moreover, we checked the separations between the pairs of spots from distinct regions, and we were able to assess that G28.817+00.365 and G31.047+00.356 can be interpreted as showing expanding motions. We analysed the profiles of single maser cloudlets and studied their variability. Contrary to single-dish studies, the interferometric data indicate variability of the emission of single-masing cloudlets. In five of the six targets expansion motions prevail. Only in the case of G31.581+00.077 can a scenario of disc-like rotation not be excluded. [...]

 - **Abstract**
 The composition and distribution of the gas in a protoplanetary disk plays a key role in shaping the outcome of the planet formation process. Observationally, the recovery of information such as the emission height and brightness temperature from interferometric data is often limited by the imaging processes. To overcome the limitations of image-reconstruction when analyzing gas emission from interferometric observations, we have introduced a parametric model to fit the main observable properties of the gaseous disk component in the visibility plane. This approach is also known as parametric visibility modeling. We applied our parametric visibility modeling to the gas brightness distribution of the molecular line emission from 12CO J=3-2 and 13CO J=3-2 in the disk around MHO 6, a very-low-mass star in the Taurus star-forming Region. To improve the flux fidelity of our parametric models, we combined models with different pixel resolution before the computation of their visibilities, referred to as ``nesting images.'' When we apply our parametric visibility modeling to MHO 6, with independent fits to the emission from its CO isopotologues, the models return the same consistent results for the stellar mass, disk geometry, and central velocity. The surface height and brightness temperature distribution are also recovered. When compared to other disks, MHO 6 surface height is among the most elevated surfaces, consistent with the predictions for disks around very-low-mass stars. This work demonstrates the feasibility of running rapidly iterable parametric visibility models in moderate resolution and sensitivity interferometric observations. More importantly, this methodology opens the analysis of disk's gas morphology to observations where image-based techniques are unable to robustly operate, as in the case of the compact disk around MHO 6.
#### ALMA-IMF XV: N$_2$H$^+$ kinematic analysis on the intermediate  protocluster G353.41

 - **Abstract**
 The ALMA-IMF Large Program provides multi-tracer observations of 15 Galactic massive protoclusters at matched sensitivity and spatial resolution. We focus on the dense gas kinematics of the G353.41 protocluster traced by N$_2$H$^+$ (1$-$0), with a critical density of $2\times10^5$~cm$^{-3}$, and spatial resolution $\sim$0.02~pc. G353.41, at a distance of 2~kpc, is embedded in a larger scale ($\sim$8~pc) filament and has a mass of 2500~M$_{\odot}$ within $1.3\times1.3$~pc$^2$. We extract the N$_2$H$^+$ isolated line component and we decompose it by fitting up to 3 Gaussian velocity components. This allows us to identify velocity structures that are either muddled or impossible to identify in the traditional position-velocity diagram. We identify multiple velocity gradients (VGs) on large and small scales. We find good agreement between the N$_2$H$^+$ and the previously reported DCN core velocities, suggesting that cores are kinematically coupled to the dense gas in which they form. We measure 9 converging V-shaped VGs, located in filaments, that are sometimes associated with cores near their point of convergence. The average timescale associated with the V-shapes are $\sim$67~kyr, or about twice the free-fall time of cores in the same area ($\sim$~33~kyr) but substantially shorter than protostar lifetime estimates ($\sim$~0.5~Myr). We interpret these V-shapes as inflowing gas feeding the regions near cores and we derive their mass accretion rates. This feeding might lead to further filament collapse and formation of new cores. We suggest that the protocluster is collapsing on large scales, but the velocity signature of collapse is slow compared to pure free-fall. Thus these data are consistent with a comparatively slow global protocluster contraction under gravity, and faster core formation within, suggesting the formation of multiple generations of stars over the protocluster lifetime.
#### Kinematic age of the $β$-Pictoris moving group

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate age estimation of nearby young moving groups (NYMGs) is important as they serve as crucial testbeds in various fields of astrophysics, including formation and evolution of stars, planets, as well as loose stellar associations. The $\beta$-Pictoris moving group (BPMG), being one of the closest and youngest NYMGs, has been extensively investigated, and its estimated ages have a wide range from $\sim$10 to 25 Myr, depending on the age estimation methods and data used. Unlike other age dating methods, kinematic traceback analysis offers a model-independent age assessment hence the merit in comparing many seemingly discordant age estimates. In this study, we determine the kinematic ages of the BPMG using three methods: probabilistic volume calculation, mean pairwise distance calculation, and covariance matrix analysis. These methods yield consistent results, with estimated ages in the range of 14 to 20 Myr. Implementing corrections to radial velocities due to gravitational redshift and convectional blueshift increases the ages by $\sim2-4$ Myr. Conversely, considering data uncertainties decreases the estimated ages by 1 to 2 Myr. Taken together, our analysis determined the kinematic age of BPMG to be 16.3$^{+3.4}_{-2.1}$ Myr. This age is significantly younger than the commonly accepted age of the BPMG ($\sim$24 Myr) determined primarily from the lithium depletion boundary analysis. This younger kinematic age may point to the discrepancy between the luminosity evolution and lithium depletion models or the presence of unaccounted systematic error in the method. This result underscores the necessity for systematic reevaluations of age-dating methods for nearby, young moving groups.
#### New SiS destruction and formation routes via neutral-neutral reactions  and their fundamental role in interstellar clouds at low and high metallicity  values

 - **Abstract**
 Among the silicon bearing species discovered in the interstellar medium, SiS and SiO stand out as key tracers due to their distinct chemistry and abundances in interstellar and circumstellar environments. Our objective is to enhance the network of Si- and S-bearing chemical reactions for a gas-grain model in molecular clouds, encompassing both low and high metallicities. We have calculated the energies and rate coefficients for 6 neutral atom-diatom reactions involved in the SiCS triatomic system, with a special focus on the C+SiS and S+SiC collisions. We employ the coupled cluster method with single and double substitutions and a perturbative treatment of triple substitutions (CCSD(T)) refined at the explicitly correlated CCSD(T)-F12 level. With these computational results in conjunction with data from the literature, we construct an extended network of neutral-neutral chemical reactions. We performed time-dependent models employing the Nautilus gas-grain code, setting the gas temperature to 10 K and the density to 2x10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$. The temperature dependence for the reactions involving SiS were modelled using $k(T)=\alpha \left( T/300 \right)^{\beta} \exp{(-\gamma/T)}$. The high-metallicity models significantly boost the SiS production. Higher initial abundances of C, S, and Si, roughly $\sim$2, 190, and 210 times higher, respectively, contribute to this. Around 10$^3$ yr, destruction mechanisms become relevant. The proposed production reaction S + SiC $\rightarrow$ C + SiS, mitigates these effects. By expanding the gas reaction network using a high metallicity model, we derived estimates for the abundances of interstellar molecules. The inclusion of neutral-neutral mechanisms, particularly via Si+HS and S+SiC channels, played a pivotal role in determining SiS abundance. These mechanisms carry a significance on a par with the well-known and fast ion-neutral reactions.
#### Supernova 1987A's keyhole: A long-lived jet-pair in the final explosion  phase of core-collapse supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 I further study the manner by which a pair of opposite jets shape the `keyhole' morphological structure of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) SN 1997A, now the CCSN remnant (CCSNR) 1987A. By doing so, I strengthen the claim that the jittering-jet explosion mechanism (JJEM) accounts for most, likely all, CCSNe. The `keyhole' structure comprises a northern low-intensity zone closed with a bright rim on its front and an elongated low-intensity nozzle in the south. This rim-nozzle asymmetry is observed in some cooling flow clusters and planetary nebulae that are observed to be shaped by jets. I build a toy model that uses the planar jittering jets pattern, where consecutive pairs of jets tend to jitter in a common plane, implying that the accreted gas onto the newly born neutron star at the late explosion phase flows perpendicular to that plane. This allows for a long-lived jet-launching episode. This long-lasting jet-launching episode launches more mass into the jets that can inflate larger pairs of ears or bubbles, forming the main jets' axis of the CCSNR that is not necessarily related to a possible pre-collapse core rotation. I discuss the relation of the main jets' axis to the neutron star's natal kick velocity.

 - **Abstract**
 We use Geneva-evolution-code to run evolutionary tracks for stellar masses ranging from $20$ to $85$ $M_\odot$ at SMC metallicity ($Z=0.002$). We upgrade the recipe for stellar winds by adopting our self-consistent m-CAK prescription, which reduces the value of mass-loss rate by a factor between 2 and 6 depending on the mass range. The impact of our new winds is wide, and it can be divided between direct and indirect impact. For the most massive models ($60$ and $85$ $M_\odot$) with $\dot M\gtrsim2\times10^{-7}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, the impact is direct because lower mass loss make stars remove less envelope and therefore remain more massive and less chemically enriched at their surface at the end of their MS phase. For the less massive models ($20$ and $25$ $M_\odot$) with $\dot M\lesssim2\times10^{-8}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, the impact is indirect because lower mass loss make the stars keep high rotational velocities for a longer period of time, then extending the H-core burning lifetime and reaching the end of the MS with higher surface enrichment. Given that the conditions at the H-depletion change, the stars will lose more mass during their He-core burning stages anyways. For $M_\text{zams}=20$ to $40$ $M_\odot$, our models predict stars will evolve through the Hertzsprung gap, from O-type supergiants to BSG and finally RSG, with larger mass fractions of helium compared to old evolution models. New models also set down to $M_\text{zams}=85\,M_\odot$ the minimal initial mass required for a single star to become WR at metallicity $Z=0.002$. New values for $\dot M$ need to be complemented with upgrades in additional features such as convective core overshooting and distribution of rotational velocities, besides more detailed observations from projects such as XShootU, in order to provide a robust framework for the study of massive stars at low metallicity environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Hub-filament systems (HFSs) being the potential sites of formation of star clusters and high mass stars, provide a test bed for the current theories that attempt to explain star formation globally. It is thus important to study a large number of HFSs using both intensity and velocity information to constrain these objects better observationally. We present here a study of the hub-filament system associated with G6.55-0.1 using newly obtained observations of radio continuum and $J$=2--1 transition of CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O. The radio continuum maps show multiple peaks that coincide with far-infrared dust continuum peaks indicating the presence of more than one young massive stars in the hub of the HFS. We used the velocity information from the C$^{18}$O(2--1) map to (a) show that the source G6.55-0.1 is not physically associated with the SNR W28 and (b) disentangle and identify the velocity components genuinely associated with G6.55-0.1. Among the velocity-coherent structures identified, the two filaments at 13.8 and 17.3 km s$^{-1}$ contribute a total mass accretion rate of $\sim$3000 M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ to the hub. Both the filaments also show V-shaped structure, characteristic of gravitational collapse, in their velocity profile at the location of the hub. Estimated mass per unit length of the segments of the filaments are smaller than the critical line masses derived from virial equilibrium considerations. This suggests that while the filaments are not gravitationally collapsing as a whole, the spectra from the hub indicate that the inner parts are dynamically decoupled and collapsing to form stars.
#### Monge Ampère gravity: from the large deviation principle to  cosmological simulations through optimal transport

 - **Abstract**
 We study Monge-Amp\`ere gravity (MAG) as an effective theory of cosmological structure formation through optimal transport theory. MAG is based on the Monge-Amp\`ere equation, a nonlinear version of the Poisson equation, that relates the Hessian determinant of the potential to the density field. We explain how MAG emerges from a conditioned system of independent and indistinguishable Brownian particles, through the large deviation principle, in the continuum limit. To numerically explore this highly non-linear theory, we develop a novel N-body simulation method based on semi-discrete optimal transport. Our results obtained from the very first N-body simulation of Monge-Amp\`ere gravity with over 100 millions particles show that on large scales, Monge-Amp\`ere gravity is similar to the Newtonian gravity but favours the formation of anisotropic structures such as filaments. At small scales, MAG has a weaker clustering and is screened in high-density regions. Although here we study the Monge-Amp\`ere gravity as an effective rather than a fundamental theory, our novel highly-performant optimal transport algorithm can be used to run high-resolution simulations of a large class of modified theories of gravity, such as Galileons, in which the equations of motion are second-order and of Monge-Amp\`ere type.
#### Orbital and Atmospheric Characterization of the 1RXS J034231.8+121622  System Using High-Resolution Spectroscopy Confirms That The Companion is a  Low-Mass Star

 - **Abstract**
 The 1RXS J034231.8+121622 system consists of an M dwarf primary and a directly imaged low-mass stellar companion. We use high resolution spectroscopic data from Keck/KPIC to estimate the objects' atmospheric parameters and radial velocities (RVs). Using PHOENIX stellar models, we find that the primary has a temperature of 3460 $\pm$ 50 K a metallicity of 0.16 $\pm$ 0.04, while the secondary has a temperature of 2510 $\pm$ 50 K and a metallicity of $0.13\substack{+0.12 \\ -0.11}$. Recent work suggests this system is associated with the Hyades, placing it an older age than previous estimates. Both metallicities agree with current $[Fe/H]$ Hyades measurements (0.11 -- 0.21). Using stellar evolutionary models, we obtain significantly higher masses for the objects, of 0.30 $\pm$ 0.15 $M_\odot$ and 0.08 $\pm$ 0.01 $M_\odot$ (84 $\pm$ 11 $M_{Jup}$) respectively. Using the RVs and a new astrometry point from Keck/NIRC2, we find that the system is likely an edge-on, moderately eccentric ($0.41\substack{+0.27 \\ -0.08}$) configuration. We also estimate the C/O ratio of both objects using custom grid models, obtaining 0.42 $\pm$ 0.10 (primary) and 0.55 $\pm$ 0.10 (companion). From these results, we confirm that this system most likely went through a binary star formation process in the Hyades. The significant changes in this system's parameters since its discovery highlight the importance of high resolution spectroscopy for both orbital and atmospheric characterization of directly imaged companions.

 - **Abstract**
 A compact source, G0.02467-0.0727, was detected in ALMA \threemm observations in continuum and very broad line emission. The continuum emission has a spectral index $\alpha\approx3.3$, suggesting that the emission is from dust. The line emission is detected in several transitions of CS, SO, and SO$_2$ and exhibits a line width FWHM $\approx160$ \kms. The line profile appears Gaussian. The emission is weakly spatially resolved, coming from an area on the sky $\lesssim1"$ in diameter ($\lesssim10^4$ AU at the distance of the Galactic Center; GC). The centroid velocity is $v_{LSR}\approx40$-$50$ \kms, which is consistent with a location in the Galactic Center. With multiple SO lines detected, and assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) conditions, $T_\mathrm{LTE} = 13$ K, which is colder than seen in typical GC clouds, though we cannot rule out low-density, subthermally excited, warmer gas. Despite the high velocity dispersion, no emission is observed from SiO, suggesting that there are no strong ($\gtrsim10~\mathrm{km~s}^{-1}$) shocks in the molecular gas. There are no detections at other wavelengths, including X-ray, infrared, and radio. We consider several explanations for the Millimeter Ultra-Broad Line Object (MUBLO), including protostellar outflow, explosive outflow, collapsing cloud, evolved star, stellar merger, high-velocity compact cloud, intermediate mass black hole, and background galaxy. Most of these conceptual models are either inconsistent with the data or do not fully explain it. The MUBLO is, at present, an observationally unique object.
#### Supernova remnants of red supergiants: from barrels to Cygnus loops

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernova remnants are the nebular leftover of defunct massive stars which have died during a supernova explosion, mostly while undergoing the red supergiant phase of their evolution. The morphology and emission properties of those remnants are a function of the distribution of circumstellar material at the moment of the supernova, the intrisic properties of the explosion, as well as those of the ambient medium. By means of 2.5 dimensional numerical magnetohydrodynamics simulations, we model the long term evolution of supernova remnants generated by runaway rotating massive stars moving into a magnetised interstellar medium. Radiative transfer calculations reveal that the projected non-thermal emission of the supernova remnants decreases with time, i.e. older remnants are fainter than younger ones. Older (80 kyr) supernova remnants whose progenitors were moving with space velocity corresponding to a Mach number M = 1 (v_star = 20 km/s ) in the Galactic plane of the ISM (nISM = 1/cm3 ) are brighter in synchrotron than when moving with a Mach number M = 2 (v_star = 40 km/s ). We show that runaway red supergiant progenitors first induce an asymmetric non thermal 1.4 GHz barrel like synchrotron supernova remnants (at the age of about 8 kyr), before further evolving to adopt a Cygnus loop like shape (at about 80 kyr). It is conjectured that a significative fraction of supernova remnants are currently in this bilateral-to-Cygnus-loop evolutionary sequence, and that this should be taken into account in the data interpretation of the forthcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 We apply current analytical knowledge on the characteristic mass and linear evolution of miniclusters down to redshift $z=0$ to the hypothetical minicluster distribution of the Milky Way. Using the mass-radius relation and a core-halo relation for stable soliton solutions composed of axion-like particles (ALPs), we connect the galactic minicluster mass distribution to that of their ALP star cores. We consider different temperature evolutions of the ALP field with masses in the range $10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV} \leq m_a \leq 10^{-3}\,$eV and infer the abundance and properties of QCD axion- and ALP stars in our galaxy. We re-evaluate detection prospects for collisions of neutron stars with both ALP stars and miniclusters as well as relativistic ALP bursts, so-called Bosenovae. Our analysis shows that the collision rates between miniclusters and neutron stars can become as large as $\sim 10^5\,$yr$^{-1}$ galaxy$^{-1}$, but that the fraction of encounters that can lead to resonance between ALP mass and magnetosphere plasma frequency is generally well below $\sim 1\,$yr$^{-1}$ galaxy$^{-1}$, depending on the ALP model. We confirm previous results that merger rates of ALP stars are extremely small $< 10^{-12}\,$yr$^{-1}$ galaxy$^{-1}$, while their host miniclusters can merge much more frequently, up to $\sim 10^3\,$yr$^{-1}$ galaxy$^{-1}$ for the QCD axion. We find that Bosenovae and parametric resonance are much more likely to lead to observable signatures than neutron star encounters. We also suggest that a combination of accretion and parametric resonance can lead to observable radio lines for a wide range of ALP masses $m_a$ and photon-couplings $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The Lagoon Nebula (M8) is host to multiple regions with recent and ongoing massive star formation. With M8-Main and M8 East, two prominent regions of massive star formation have been studied in detail over the past years, while large parts of the nebula have received little attention. These largely unexplored regions comprise a large sample of molecular clumps that are affected by the presence of massive O- and B-type stars. We establish an inventory of species observed towards 37 known molecular clumps in M8 by conducting an unbiased line survey for each clump. For this, we used APEX and the IRAM 30m telescope for pointed on-off observations on the clumps. These observations cover bandwidths of 53GHz and 40GHz in frequency ranges from 210GHz to 280GHz and from 70GHz to 117GHz, respectively. Temperatures are derived from rotational transitions of CH3CN, CH3C2H and para-H2CO. Additional archival data from the Spitzer, Herschel, MSX, APEX, WISE, JCMT and AKARI telescopes are used to derive physical parameters of the dust emission by fitting spectral energy distributions to the observed flux densities. Across the observed M8 region, we identify 346 transitions from 70 different molecular species, including isotopologues. We detect tracers of photo-dissociation regions across all the clumps and 38% of these clumps show signs of star formation. We find that PDR tracers are most abundant in clumps with relatively lower H2 column densities. When comparing M8 clumps to ATLASGAL sources at similar distances, we find them to be slightly less massive and have compatible luminosities and radii. This possibly indicates a fragmentation of the gas caused by the O- and B-type stars. In contrast, dust temperatures of the clumps in M8 are found to be increased by approximately 5K (25%) indicating substantial external heating of the clumps by radiation of the present massive stars.
