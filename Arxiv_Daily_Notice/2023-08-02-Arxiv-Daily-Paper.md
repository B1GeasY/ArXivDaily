 - **Abstract**
 Understanding atmospheric escape in close-in exoplanets is critical to interpreting their evolution. We map out the parameter space over which photoevaporation and core-powered mass loss dominate atmospheric escape. Generally, the transition between the two regimes is determined by the location of the Bondi radius (i.e. the sonic point of core-powered outflow) relative to the penetration depth of XUV photons. Photoevaporation dominates the loss when the XUV penetration depth lies inside the Bondi radius ($R_{XUV}<R_B$) and core-powered mass-loss when XUV radiation is absorbed higher up in the flow ($R_B<R_{XUV}$). The transition between the two regimes occurs at a roughly constant ratio of the planet's radius to its Bondi radius, with the exact value depending logarithmically on planetary and stellar properties. In general, core-powered mass-loss dominates for lower-gravity planets with higher equilibrium temperatures, and photoevaporation dominates for higher-gravity planets with lower equilibrium temperatures. However, planets can transition between these two mass-loss regimes during their evolution, and core-powered mass loss can ``enhance'' photo-evaporation over a significant region of parameter space. Interestingly, a planet that is ultimately stripped by core-powered mass-loss has likely only ever experienced core-powered mass-loss. In contrast a planet that is ultimately stripped by photoevaporation could have experienced an early phase of core-powered mass-loss. Applying our results to the observed super-Earth population suggests that it contains significant fractions of planets where each mechanism controlled the final removal of the H/He envelope, although photoevaporation appears to be responsible for the final carving of the exoplanet radius-valley.
#### Oxygen-bearing organic molecules in comet 67P's dusty coma: first  evidence for abundant heterocycles

 - **Abstract**
 The puzzling complexity of terrestrial biomolecules is driving the search for complex organic molecules in the Interstellar Medium (ISM) and serves as a motivation for many in situ studies of reservoirs of extraterrestrial organics from meteorites and interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) to comets and asteroids. Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) -- the best-studied comet to date -- has been visited and accompanied for two years by the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft. Around 67P's perihelion and under dusty conditions, the high-resolution mass spectrometer on board provided a spectacular glimpse into this comet's chemical complexity. For this work, we analyzed in unprecedented detail the O-bearing organic volatiles. In a comparison of 67P's inventory to molecules detected in the ISM, in other comets, and in Soluble Organic Matter (SOM) extracted from the Murchison meteorite, we also highlight the (pre)biotic relevance of different chemical groups of species. We report first evidence for abundant extraterrestrial O-bearing heterocycles (with abundances relative to methanol often on the order of 10% with a relative error margin of 30-50%) and various representatives of other molecule classes such as carboxylic acids and esters, aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols. Like with the pure hydrocarbons, some hydrogenated forms seem to be dominant over their dehydrogenated counterparts. An interesting example is tetrahydrofuran (THF) as it might be a more promising candidate for searches in the ISM than the long-sought furan itself. Our findings not only support and guide future efforts to investigate the origins of chemical complexity in space, but also they strongly encourage studies of, e.g., the ratios of unbranched vs. branched and hydrogenated vs. dehydrogenated species in astrophysical ice analogs in the laboratory as well as by modeling.
#### The Infrared Extinction Law in the Ophiuchus Molecular Cloud based on  UKIDSS and Spitzer

 - **Abstract**
 Investigating the extinction properties in dense molecular clouds is of significant importance for understanding the behavior of interstellar dust and its impact on observations. In this study, we comprehensively examined the extinction law in the Ophiuchus cloud across a wavelength range from 0.8$\,\mu\rm m$ to 8$\,\mu\rm m$. To achieve this, we analyzed NIR and MIR data obtained from the UKIDSS GCS and the Spitzer c2d survey, respectively. By fitting a series of color-color diagrams, we determined color-excess ratios $E_{J-\lambda}/E_{J-K}$ for seven passbands. These ratios were then directly converted to derive the relative extinction law $A_\lambda/A_K$. Our findings demonstrate that the Ophiuchus cloud exhibits a characteristic of flat MIR extinction, consistent with previous studies. Additionally, our results reveal variations in the extinction law with extinction depth, indicating a flatter trend from the NIR to MIR bands as extinction increases. Notably, our analysis reveals no significant difference in the MIR extinction law among the four dark clouds: L1712, L1689, L1709, and L1688. However, distinct variations were observed in the extinction law for regions outside the dark clouds, specifically L1688N and L1688W. These regions displayed lower color-excess ratios $E_{J-\lambda}/E_{J-K}$ in the Spitzer/IRAC bands. This observation lends support to the dust growth occurring in the dense regions of the Ophiuchus cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of observations of complex powerful type II burst associated with narrow Earth-directed CME, which was ejected at around 11 UT on 31 May 2013. The observations were performed by radio telescope UTR-2, which operated as local interferometer, providing the possibility of detection of the spatial parameters of the radio emission source. There are also polarization data from URAN-2 radio telescope. The CME was detected by two space-born coronagraphs SOHO/LASCO/C2 and STEREO/COR1-BEHIND, and was absolutely invisible for STEREO-AHEAD spacecraft. The associated type II burst consisted of two successive parts of quite different appearance on the dynamic spectrum. The first burst was narrow in frequency, had cloudy structure and was completely unpolarized while the second one represented rich herring-bone structure and exposed high degree of circular polarization. Both parts of the whole event reveal band splitting and well distinguished harmonic structure. The positions and sizes of the sources of the type II burst were found using cross-correlation functions of interferometer bases. The sources of the type II bursts elements were found to be of about 15 arcmin in size in average, with the smallest ones reaching as low as 10 arcmin. Corresponding brightness temperatures were estimated. In most cases these temperatures were between $10^{11}$ and $10^{12}$ K with maximum value as high as $10^{14}$ K. The spatial displacement of the source was measured and model independent velocities of the type II burst sources were determined.
