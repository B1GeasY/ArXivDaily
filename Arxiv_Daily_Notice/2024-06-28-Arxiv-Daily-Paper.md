 - **Abstract**
 In order to develop a more comprehensive picture of star formation, it is essential to understand the physical relationship between dense cores and the filaments embedding them. There is evidence that magnetic fields play a crucial role in this context. We aim to understand how magnetic fields influence the properties and kinematics of an isolated filament located east of the Barnard 59 clump, belonging to the Pipe Nebula. We use near infrared polarization observations to determine the magnetic field configuration, and we apply the Davis Chandrasekhar Fermi method to infer the magnetic field strength in the plane of the sky. Furthermore, we use complementary data from the James Clerk Maxwell Submillimetre Telescope (JCMT) of C18O and 13CO J=3-2 transition to determine the filament's kinematics. Finally, we model the radial density profile of the filament with polytropic cylindrical models. Our results indicate that the filament is stable to radial collapse and is radially supported by agents other than thermal pressure. In addition, based on previous observations of emission lines on this source, we suggest that gas is flowing toward the hub, while C18O (3-2) non-thermal motions indicate that the cloud is in a quiescent state.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations with FAST recently detected HI 21-cm emission near M94, revealing an intriguing object, Cloud-9, without an optical counterpart. Subsequent analysis suggests Cloud-9 is consistent with a gas-rich ($M_{\rm HI} \approx 10^{6} \ M_{\odot}$), starless dark matter (DM) halo of mass $M_{200} \approx 5 \times 10^{9} \ M_{\odot}$. Using VLA in D-array configuration, we present interferometric observations of Cloud-9 revealing it as a dynamically cold ($W_{50} \approx 12 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$), non-rotating, and spatially-asymmetric system, exhibiting gas compression on one side and a tail-like structure towards the other, features likely originating from ram pressure. Our observations suggest Cloud-9 is consistent with a starless $\Lambda$CDM dark matter halo if the gas is largely isothermal. If interpreted as a faint dwarf, Cloud-9 is similar to Leo T, a nearby gas-rich galaxy that would fall below current optical detection limits at Cloud-9's distance ($d\approx 5 \rm \ Mpc$). Further observations with HST reaching magnitudes $m_{g} \approx 30$ would help identify such a galaxy or dramatically lower current limits to its stellar mass ($M_{\rm gal} \lesssim 10^{5} \ M_{\odot}$). Cloud-9 thus stands as the firmest starless DM halo candidate to date or the faintest galaxy known at its distance.
#### Li Evolution Among Stars of Low/Intermediate Mass: The Metal-Deficient Open Cluster, NGC 2204

 - **Abstract**
 We have analyzed high-dispersion spectra in the Li 6708 Angstrom region for 167 stars within the anticenter cluster, NGC 2204. From 105 probable members, abundance analysis of 45 evolved stars produces [Fe/H] = -0.40 +/- 0.12, [Si/Fe] = 0.14 +/- 0.12, [Ca/Fe] = 0.29 +/- 0.07, and [Ni/Fe] = -0.12 +/- 0.10, where quoted errors are standard deviations. With E(B-V) = 0.07 and (m-M)_0 = 13.12, appropriate isochrones provide an excellent match from the main sequence through the tip of the giant branch for an age of 1.85 +/- 0.05 Gyr. Li spectrum synthesis produces A(Li) below 1.4 at the base of the red giant branch to a detectable value of -0.4 at the tip. Six probable AGB stars and all but one red clump star have only Li upper limits. A rapidly rotating red giant is identified as a possible Li-rich giant, assuming it is a red clump star. Main sequence turnoff stars have a well-defined A(Li) = 2.83 +/- 0.03 (sem) down to the Li-dip wall at the predicted mass of 1.29 solar masses. Despite the same isochronal age as the more metal-rich NGC 2506, the red giant luminosity distribution reflects a younger morphology similar to NGC 7789, possibly indicating a deeper metallicity impact on stellar structure and A(Li) than previously assumed. As in NGC 2506 and NGC 7789, the NGC 2204 turnoff exhibits a broad range of rotation speeds, making abundance estimation impossible for some stars. The cluster place within Galactic A(Li) evolution is discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The pulsational mode of gravitational collapse (PMGC) originating from the combined gravito-electrostatic interaction in complex dust molecular clouds (DMCs) is a canonical mechanisms leading to the onset of astronomical structure formation dynamics. A semi-analytic generalized model is formulated to examine the collective effects of polarization force, Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity, and non-thermal (r, q)-distributed electrons on the stability of the PMGC concurrently. The ions are treated with the help of the Maxwellian thermo-statistical distribution law whereas the electrons are modelled with the non-thermal (r, q)-distribution law. The dust species including neutral and negatively charged particles are treated as fluids. A spherical normal mode analysis obtains a quartic linear dispersion relation for the PMGC. The oscillatory and propagation characteristics of the PMGC mode dynamics are investigated on a constructed numerical platform. It found that an increase in the polarization force and positive EiBI parameter significantly enhances the instability resulting in the DMC collapse, and vice versa. The electron non-thermality spectral parameters play a vital role as stabilizing factor. Its reliability and applicability are finally outlined in light of the previous astronomical studies in the same thematic direction.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Open clusters that emerged from the star forming regions as gravitationally bound structures are subjected to star evaporation, ejection, and tidal forces throughout the rest of their lives. Consequently they form tidal tails that can stretch kiloparsecs along the cluster's orbit. Aims. Cluster members are typically found by searching for overdensities in some parameter space (positions and velocities or sometimes actions and orbital parameters of stars). However, this method is not effective in identifying stars located in the tidal tails far from the open cluster cores. We present a probabilistic method for finding distant cluster members without relying on searching for overdensities and apply it to 476 open clusters. Methods. First, we simulate the dissolution of a cluster and obtain a probability distribution (likelihood) describing where cluster members are to be found. The distribution of stars from the Gaia DR3 catalogue in high likelihood regions is then compared to the simulated stellar population of the Galaxy to define the membership probability of each star. Results. The survey of cluster members included all stars with a magnitude of G < 17.5 and larger clusters with an age of > 100 Myr within 3 kpc from the Sun. We successfully find stars with high membership probabilities in the tidal tails of most clusters, stretching more than a kiloparsec from the cluster cores in some cases. We analyse the morphological properties of tidal tails, demonstrate how properly normalised membership probabilities aid systematic studies of open clusters and publish a catalogue of stars found in the tidal tails.

 - **Abstract**
 The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is responsive to kinetic disruptions generated by nearby astrophysical events. In this work, we study the saturation and dissipation of turbulent hydrodynamics within the CGM through an extensive array of 252 numerical simulations with a large parameter space. These simulations are endowed with proper cooling mechanisms to consistently explore the parameter space spanned by the average gas density, metallicity, and turbulence driving strength. A dichotomy emerges in the dynamics dissipation behaviors. Disturbances that are hot and subsonic are characterized by weak compression and slow dissipation, resulting in density fluctuations typically $\lesssim 10^{-2}$. Conversely, warm supersonic turbulence, marked by significant compression shocks and subsequent rapid cooling, is associated with substantial clumping factors $\sim 10^0-10^1$. In the supersonic cases, the kinetic energy decay is divided into a rate-limiting phase of shock dissipation and a comparatively swift phase of thermal dissipation, predominantly occurring within the overdense regions. Upon turbulence driving turnoff, the strong density contrasts decay within a relatively brief timescale of $\sim 30 - 300~{\rm Myr}$, depending on the average gas density. Dense clouds are crushed on similar timescales of $ \sim 30 - 100 ~{\rm Myr} $, depending on turbulence driving strength but independent from average gas density. Results of this work also contribute a novel dataset of dissipation timescales that incorporates an understanding of kinematics and thermodynamics in addition to the traditional cooling rate tables, which may serve as a valuable asset for forthcoming simulations that aim to explore gas dynamics on galactic and cosmological scales.
#### A Star Cluster Population of High Mass Black Hole Mergers in Gravitational Wave Data

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar evolution theories predict a gap in the black hole birth mass spectrum as the result of pair instability processes in the cores of massive stars. This gap, however, is not seen in the binary black hole masses inferred from gravitational wave data. One explanation is that black holes form dynamically in dense star clusters where smaller black holes merge to form more massive black holes, populating the mass gap. We show that this model predicts a distribution of the effective and precessing spin parameters, $\chi_{\rm eff}$ and $\chi_{\rm p}$, within the mass gap that is insensitive to assumptions about black hole natal spins. We analyze the distribution of $\chi_{\rm eff}$ as a function of primary mass for the black hole binaries in the third gravitational wave transient catalog. We infer the presence of a high-mass population of black holes that is consistent with hierarchical formation in dense star clusters. This population becomes dominant above $44^{+6}_{-4} M_\odot$, which we interpret as the lower edge of the pair-instability mass gap. Upcoming data will enable us to tightly constrain the hierarchical formation hypothesis and refine our understanding of binary black hole formation.
#### The Maclaurin spheroid in disguise. New figures of equilibrium with external magnetic support

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19210

 - **Abstract**
 We show that a rigidly rotating, homogeneous ellipsoid of revolution threaded by a uniform, coaxial magnetic field is a possible figure of equilibrium. While the spheroidal shape is fully preserved, the rotation rate is modified. Accordingly, we extend the fundamental formula by Maclaurin. In contrast with the non-magnetic case, prolate shapes are permitted, but there are critical states in the form of maximum elongations, depending on ionisation fraction, ion/electron drift, magnetic field and mass-density. As checked from numerical simulations based on the Self-Consistent-Field method, prolate states survive to gas compressibility. The relevance to interstellar clouds is outlined.
#### Diffuse interstellar bands in the near-infrared: Expanding the reddening range

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19229

 - **Abstract**
 We have investigated the behaviour of three strong near-infrared diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) at {\lambda}13177 Å, {\lambda}14680 Å, and {\lambda}15272 Å, on a larger sample of sightlines and over a wider range of extinctions than previously studied, utilizing spectra from three observatories. We applied two telluric correction techniques to reduce atmospheric contamination and have used Gaussian fits to characterise the DIB profiles and measure equivalent widths. We confirmed strong and approximately linear correlations with reddening of the {\lambda}13177 Å, {\lambda}14680 Å and {\lambda}15272 Å DIBs, extending them to higher reddening values and strengthening their link to interstellar matter. Modelling of the {\lambda}14680 Å DIB profiles revealed intrinsic variations, including line broadening, linked to their formation processes. This effect is particularly pronounced in the Galactic Centre (GC) environment, where multiple diffuse molecular clouds along the line of sight contribute to line broadening. We have detected one new DIB candidate at {\lambda}14795 Å on sightlines with high reddening.
#### Calibrating and standardizing the Tip of the Red Giant Branch in the Small Magellanic Cloud using small-amplitude red giants

Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19375

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19375

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the absolute calibration of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using small amplitude red giant stars (SARGs) classified by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). We show that all stars near the SMC's TRGB are SARGs. Distinguishing older and younger RGs near the Tip according to two period-luminosity sequences labeled A and B, we show many similarities among SARG populations of the LMC and the SMC, along with notable differences. Specifically, SMC SARGs have shorter periods due to lower metallicity and lower amplitudes due to younger ages than LMC SARGs. We discover two period-color relations near the TRGB that span all A-sequence and B-sequence stars in the OGLE-III footprints of the SMC and LMC, and we investigate using periods instead of color for TRGB standardization. Using variability derived information only, we trace the SMC's age and metallicity gradients and show the core to be populated by younger, more metal rich RGs. B-sequence SARGs yield both the most precise and the brightest tip magnitude, and they are best suited for distance determination and Hubble constant measurements because they correspond to the oldest stars near TRGB. Assuming the geometric distance measured by detached eclipsing binaries, the B-sequence yields the SMC's most accurate TRGB calibration to date: M_{F814W,syn} = -4.057 \pm 0.019(stat.) \pm 0.029(syst.) mag (1.5% in distance). Further study of SARGs will unravel the impact of population diversity on TRGB distances and further improve TRGB standardization.
