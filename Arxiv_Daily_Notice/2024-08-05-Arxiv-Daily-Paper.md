 - **Abstract**
 We have used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to map CO(3-2) emission from a galaxy, DLA-B1228g, associated with the high-metallicity damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorber at $z \approx 2.1929$ towards the QSO PKS B1228-113. At an angular resolution of $\approx0.32''\times0.24''$, DLA-B1228g shows extended CO(3-2) emission with a deconvolved size of $\approx0.78''\times0.18''$, i.e. a spatial extent of $\approx6.4$ kpc. We detect extended stellar emission from DLA-B1228g in a Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 F160W image, and find that H$\alpha$ emission is detected in a Very Large Telescope SINFONI image from only one side of the galaxy. While the clumpy nature of the F160W emission and the offset between the kinematic and physical centers of the CO(3-2) emission are consistent with a merger scenario, this appears unlikely due to the lack of strong H$\alpha$ emission, the symmetric double-peaked CO(3-2) line profile, the high molecular gas depletion timescale, and the similar velocity dispersions in the two halves of the CO(3-2) image. Kinematic modelling reveals that the CO(3-2) emission is consistent with arising from an axisymmetric rotating disk, with an exponential profile, a rotation velocity of $v_{rot}=328\pm7$ km s$^{-1}$, and a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_{v}=62\pm7$ km s$^{-1}$. The high value of the ratio $v_{rot}/\sigma_v$, $\approx5.3$, implies that DLA-B1228g is a rotation-dominated cold disk galaxy, the second case of a high-$z$ HI-absorption-selected galaxy identified with a cold rotating disk. We obtain a dynamical mass of $M_{dyn}= (1.5\pm0.1)\times10^{11}~M_\odot$, similar to the molecular gas mass of $\approx10^{11} M_\odot$ inferred from earlier CO(1-0) studies; this implies that the galaxy is baryon-dominated in its inner regions.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) in identifying and characterizing white dwarfs (WDs) within the Milky Way Galaxy. Leveraging the UVIT point source catalogue towards SMC and crossmatching with Gaia DR3 data, we identified 43 single WDs (37 new detections), 13 new WD+main sequence (MS) candidates and 161 UV bright MS stars by analysing their Spectral Energy Distributions (SED). Using the WD evolutionary models, we determine the masses, effective temperatures, and cooling ages of these identified WDs. Masses of these WDs range from 0.2 to 1.3 M$_{\odot}$ and effective temperatures (T$_{eff}$) between 10000 K to 15000 K, with cooling ages spanning 0.1 to 2 Gyr. Notably, we detect hotter WDs compared to literature values, which is attributed to the sensitivity of UVIT. Furthermore, we report the detection of 20 new extremely low-mass (ELM) candidates from our analysis. Future spectroscopic studies of the ELM candidates will help us understand the formation scenarios of these exotic objects. Despite limitations in Gaia DR3 distance measurements for optically faint WDs, we provide a crude estimate of the WD space density within 1kpc as 1.3 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ pc$^{-3}$, which is higher than previous estimates in the literature. Our results underscore the instrumental capabilities of UVIT and anticipate the forthcoming UV missions like INSIST for systematic WD discovery. Our methodology sets a precedent for future analyses in other UVIT fields to find more WDs and perform spectroscopic studies to verify their candidacy.

 - **Abstract**
 A leading model for Type Ia supernovae involves the double-detonation of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf. Double-detonations arise when a surface helium shell detonation generates shockwaves that trigger a core detonation; this mechanism may be triggered via accretion or during the merger of binaries. Most previous double-detonation simulations only included the primary white dwarf; however, the fate of the secondary has significant observational consequences. Recently, hydrodynamic simulations accounted for the companion in double-degenerate double-detonation mergers. In the merger of a 1.05$\text{M}_{\odot}$ primary white dwarf and 0.7$\text{M}_{\odot}$ secondary white dwarf, the primary consistently detonates while the fate of the secondary remains uncertain. We consider two versions of this scenario, one in which the secondary survives and another in which it detonates. We present the first 3D radiative transfer calculations for these models and show that the synthetic observables for both models are similar and match properties of the peculiar 02es-like subclass of Type Ia supernovae. Our calculations show angle dependencies sensitive to the companion's fate, and we can obtain a closer spectroscopic match to normal Type Ia supernovae when the secondary detonates and the effects of helium detonation ash are minimised. The asymmetry in the width-luminosity relationship is comparable to previous double-detonation models, but the overall spread is increased with a secondary detonation. The secondary detonation has a meaningful impact on all synthetic observables; however, multidimensional nebular phase calculations are needed to support or rule out either model as a likely explanation for Type Ia supernovae.
#### Inverse Raman scattering and the diffuse interstellar bands: an exploration of the systemic interconnections between spontaneous and inverse Raman scattering and extended red emission, Red Rectangle bands, and diffuse interstellar bands

 - **Abstract**
 First identified in 1964, inverse Raman scattering (IRS) is a nonlinear stimulated phenomenon that induces Raman scattered absorptions where Raman emissions would be expected. While IRS is less well-known than stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), this study highlights its significance in analyzing the spectra of stars located in the distant background of HI interstellar clouds. Specifically, ultraviolet emission lines Raman scattered by atomic hydrogen, typically observed in emission at wide scattering angles in the optical spectra of symbiotic stars and nebulae, should appear as IRS absorption features in the optical spectra of the background stars. I show that all known interstellar Raman scattered emission lines in the H-alpha wavelength region are detected in absorption as diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) in the spectra of reddened stars, and conclude that IRS by atomic hydrogen resolves the longstanding puzzle of the processes involved in producing these bands, and perhaps also explains the equally mysterious 2200A bump of ultraviolet extinction curves. This identification of DIBs as IRS HI absorptions sheds new light on the perplexing relationship between DIBs and the Red Rectangle nebula emission bands (RRBs). The conditions under which DIBs are detected highlight the importance of considering the physical relationship between the observer, the HI medium, and the direction of the illuminating radiation field (i.e., the geometry of the observation) in observations of HI interstellar matter. Observing in the direction of the radiation field or on its side determines whether IRS, yielding DIBs and the 2200A bump, or spontaneous Raman scattering at wide scattering angles, resulting in ERE, Raman scattered emission lines (including RRBs), and the unidentified infrared bands, will be observed.

 - **Abstract**
 KHARMA (an acronym for "Kokkos-based High-Accuracy Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics with Adaptive mesh refinement") is a new open-source code for conducting general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations in stationary spacetimes, primarily of accretion systems. It implements among other options the High-Accuracy Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics (HARM) scheme, but is written from scratch in C++ with the Kokkos programming model in order to run efficiently on both CPUs and GPUs. In addition to being fast, KHARMA is written to be readable, modular, and extensible, separating functionality into "packages," representing, e.g., algorithmic components or physics extensions. Components of the core ideal GRMHD scheme can be swapped at runtime, and additional packages are included to simulate electron temperature evolution, viscous hydrodynamics, and for designing chained multi-scale "bridged" simulations. This chapter presents the computational environment and requirements for KHARMA, features and design which meet these requirements, and finally, validation and performance data.
#### CXOU J005245.0-722844: Discovery of a Be Star / White Dwarf binary system in the SMC via a very fast, super-Eddington X-ray outburst event

 - **Abstract**
 CXOU J005245.0-722844 is an X-ray source in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) that has long been known as a Be/X-ray binary (BeXRB) star, containing an OBe main sequence star and a compact object. In this paper, we report on a new very fast X-ray outburst from CXOU J005245.0-722844. X-ray observations taken by Swift constrain the duration of the outburst to less than 16 days and find that the source reached super-Eddington X-ray luminosities during the initial phases of the eruption. The XRT spectrum of CXOU J005245.0-722844 during this outburst reveals a super-soft X-ray source, best fit by an absorbed thermal blackbody model. Optical and Ultraviolet follow-up observations from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE), Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), and Swift identify a brief ~0.5 magnitude optical burst coincident with the X-ray outburst that lasted for less than 7 days. Optical photometry additionally identifies the orbital period of the system to be 17.55 days and identifies a shortening of the period to 17.14 days in the years leading up to the outburst. Optical spectroscopy from the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) confirms that the optical companion is an early-type OBe star. We conclude from our observations that the compact object in this system is a white dwarf (WD), making this the seventh candidate Be/WD X-ray binary. The X-ray outburst is found to be the result of a very-fast, ultra-luminous nova similar to the outburst of MAXI J0158-744.

 - **Abstract**
 Complementary to high-energy experimental efforts, indirect astrophysical searches of particles beyond the standard model have long been pursued. The present article follows the latter approach and considers, for the first time, the self-consistent treatment of the energy losses from dark flavored particles produced in the decay of hyperons during a core-collapse supernova (CCSN). To this end, general relativistic supernova simulations in spherical symmetry are performed, featuring six-species Boltzmann neutrino transport, and covering the long-term evolution of the nascent remnant proto-neutron star (PNS) deleptonization for several tens of seconds. A well-calibrated hyperon equation of state (EOS) is therefore implemented into the supernova simulations and tested against the corresponding nucleonic model. It is found that supernova observables, such as the neutrino signal, are robustly insensitive to the appearance of hyperons for the simulation times considered in the present study. The presence of hyperons enables an additional channel for the appearance of dark sector particles, which is considered at the level of the $\Lambda$ hyperon decay. Assuming massless particles that escape the PNS after being produced, these channels expedite the deleptonizing PNS and the cooling behaviour. This, in turn, shortens the neutrino emission timescale. The present study confirms the previously estimated upper limits on the corresponding branching ratios for low and high mass PNS, by effectively reducing the neutrino emission timescale by a factor of two. This is consistent with the classical argument deduced from the neutrino detection associated with SN1987A.
