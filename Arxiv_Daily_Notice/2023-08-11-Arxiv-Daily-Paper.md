 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we revisit 32 planetary systems around evolved stars observed within the framework of the Okayama Planet Search Program and its collaborative framework of the EAPS-Net to search for additional companions and investigate the properties of stars and giant planets in multiple-planet systems. With our latest radial velocities obtained from Okayama Astrophysical Observatory (OAO), we confirm an additional giant planet in the wide orbit of 75 Cet system ($P_{\rm{c}} = 2051.62_{-40.47}^{+45.98}\ \rm{d}$, $M_{\rm{c}}\sin i=0.912_{-0.090}^{+0.088}\ M_{\rm{J}}$, and $a_{\rm{c}}=3.929_{-0.058}^{+0.052}\ \rm{au}$), along with five stars exhibiting long-term radial velocity accelerations, which indicates massive companions in the wide orbits. We have also found that the radial velocity variations of several planet-harboring stars may indicate additional planet candidates, stellar activities, or other understudied sources. These stars include $\epsilon$ Tau, 11 Com, 24 Boo, 41 Lyn, 14 And, HD 32518, and $\omega$ Ser. We further constrain the orbital configuration of the HD 5608, HD 14067, HD 120084, and HD 175679 systems by combining radial velocities with astrometry, as their host central stars exhibit significant astrometric accelerations. For other systems, we simply refine their orbital parameters. Moreover, our study indicates that the OPSP planet-harboring stars are more metal-poor compared to the currently known planet-harboring stars, and this is likely due to the $B-V$ color upper limit at 1.0 for star selection in the beginning of the survey. Finally, by investigating the less-massive giant planets ($< 5 M_{\rm{J}}$) around currently known planet-harboring evolved stars, we have found that metallicity positively correlates with the multiplicity and total planet mass of the system, which can be evidence for the core-accretion planet formation model.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot corinos are of great interest due to their richness in interstellar complex organic molecules (COMs) and the consequent potential prebiotic connection to solar-like planetary systems. Recent surveys have reported an increasing number of hot corino detections in Class 0/I protostars; however, the relationships between their physical properties and the hot-corino signatures remain elusive. In this study, our objective is to establish a general picture of the detectability of the hot corinos by identifying the origin of the hot-corino signatures in the sample of young stellar objects (YSOs) obtained from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (ALMASOP) project. We apply spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling to our sample and identify the physical parameters of the modeled YSOs directly, linking the detection of hot-corino signatures to the envelope properties of the YSOs. Imaging simulations of the methanol emission further support this scenario. We, therefore, posit that the observed COM emission originates from the warm inner envelopes of the sample YSOs, based on both the warm region size and the envelope density profile. The former is governed by the source luminosity and is additionally affected by the disk and cavity properties, while the latter is related to the evolutionary stages. This scenario provides a framework for detecting hot-corino signatures toward luminous Class 0 YSOs, with fewer detections observed toward similarly luminous Class I sources.
#### An ALMA Glimpse of Dense Molecular Filaments Associated with High-mass  Protostellar Systems in the Large Magellanic Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 Recent millimeter/sub-millimeter facilities have revealed the physical properties of filamentary molecular clouds in relation to high-mass star formation. A uniform survey of the nearest, face-on star-forming galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), complements the Galactic knowledge. We present ALMA survey data with a spatial resolution of $\sim$0.1 pc in the 0.87 mm continuum and HCO$^{+}$(4-3) emission toward 30 protostellar objects with luminosities of 10$^4$-10$^{5.5}$ $L_{\odot}$ in the LMC. The spatial distributions of the HCO$^{+}$(4-3) line and thermal dust emission are well correlated, indicating that the line effectively traces dense, filamentary gas with an H$_2$ volume density of $\gtrsim$10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$ and a line mass of $\sim$10$^3$-10$^{4}$ $M_{\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$. Furthermore, we obtain an increase in the velocity linewidths of filamentary clouds, which follows a power-law dependence on their H$_2$ column densities with an exponent of $\sim$0.5. This trend is consistent with observations toward filamentary clouds in nearby star-forming regions withiin $ \lesssim$1 kpc from us and suggests enhanced internal turbulence within the filaments owing to surrounding gas accretion. Among the 30 sources, we find that 14 are associated with hub-filamentary structures, and these complex structures predominantly appear in protostellar luminosities exceeding $\sim$5 $\times$10$^4$ $L_{\odot}$. The hub-filament systems tend to appear in the latest stages of their natal cloud evolution, often linked to prominent H$\;${\sc ii} regions and numerous stellar clusters. Our preliminary statistics suggest that the massive filaments accompanied by hub-type complex features may be a necessary intermediate product in forming extremely luminous high-mass stellar systems capable of ultimately dispersing the parent cloud.
#### The White Dwarf Mass-Orbital Period Relation Under Wind Mass Loss

 - **Abstract**
 Helium white dwarfs (HeWDs) are thought to form from low-mass red giant stars experiencing binary interaction. Because the helium core mass of a red giant star is closely related to the stellar radius, there exists well-known relation between the orbital period ($P_{\rm orb}$) and the mass ($M_{\rm WD}$) of the HeWDs, which is almost independent of the type of the companion star. Traditional derivation of the $M_{\rm WD}$-$P_{\rm orb}$ relation generally neglected the effect of wind mass loss from the red giants, while observations show that wind mass loss from red giants in binary systems is systematically higher than that from isolated stars. In this work, we calculate binary evolution with tidally enhanced stellar wind (TEW) and find that it causes significantly scatter of the traditional $M_{\rm WD}$-$P_{\rm orb}$ relation. The TEW can prevent the red giants from overflowing their Roche lobes and slow down the growth of the helium core, leaving a lower-mass HeWD for given orbital period. This scenario may account for some of the HeWD binaries that deviate from the traditional $M_{\rm WD}$-$P_{\rm orb}$ relation. However, we point out that observations of more HeWD binaries in wide orbits are needed to test the TEW model and to constrain the enhanced wind factor.
