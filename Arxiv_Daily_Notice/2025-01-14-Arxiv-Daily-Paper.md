#### A Catalog of Stellar and Dust Properties for 500,000 Stars in the Southwest Bar of the Small Magellanic Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalog of individual stellar and dust extinction properties along close to 500,000 sight lines in the southwest bar of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The catalog is based on multiband Hubble Space Telescope photometric data spanning near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths from the Small Magellanic Cloud Investigation of Dust and Gas Evolution survey (SMIDGE) covering a 100 x 200 pc area. We use the probabilistic technique of the Bayesian Extinction And Stellar Tool (BEAST) to model the spectral energy distributions of individual stars in SMIDGE and include the effects of observational uncertainties in the data. We compare BEAST-derived dust extinction properties with tracers of the interstellar medium, such as the emission from the 12CO (2-1) transition (I(CO)), the dust mass surface density ({\Sigma}dust) from far-IR emission, the H I column density (N(HI)) from the 21cm transition, and the mass fraction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; qPAH, derived from IR emission). We find that the dust extinction (A(V )) in the SMIDGE field is strongly correlated with {\Sigma}dust and I(CO), and less so with N(HI) and qPAH, and suggest potential explanations. Our extinction measurements are also sensitive to the presence of the 2175 Å bump in the extinction curve toward UV bright stars. While most do not show evidence for the bump, we identify ~200 lines of sight that are 2175 Å bump candidates. Furthermore, we find distinct structures in the dust extinction-distance distributions that provide insights into the 3D geometry of the SMC.

 - **Abstract**
 Global solar photospheric magnetic maps play a critical role in solar and heliospheric physics research. Routine magnetograph measurements of the field occur only along the Sun-Earth line, leaving the far-side of the Sun unobserved. Surface Flux Transport (SFT) models attempt to mitigate this by modeling the surface evolution of the field. While such models have long been established in the community (with several releasing public full-Sun maps), none are open source. The Open Source Flux Transport (OFT) model seeks to fill this gap by providing an open and user-extensible SFT model that also builds on the knowledge of previous models with updated numerical and data acquisition/assimilation methods along with additional user-defined features. In this first of a series of papers on OFT, we introduce its computational core: the High-performance Flux Transport (HipFT) code (this http URL). HipFT implements advection, diffusion, and data assimilation in a modular design that supports a variety of flow models and options. It can compute multiple realizations in a single run across model parameters to create ensembles of maps for uncertainty quantification and is high-performance through the use of multi-CPU and multi-GPU parallelism. HipFT is designed to enable users to easily write extensions, enhancing its flexibility and adaptability. We describe HipFT's model features, validations of its numerical methods, performance of its parallel and GPU-accelerated code implementation, analysis/post-processing options, and example use cases.
#### Comparison of Equations of State for Neutron Stars with First-Order Phase Transitions: A Qualitative Study

 - **Abstract**
 The equation of state is fundamental in describing matter under the extreme conditions characteristic of neutron stars and is central to advancing our understanding of dense matter physics. A critical challenge, however, lies in accurately modelling first-order phase transitions while ensuring thermodynamic consistency and aligning with astrophysical observations. This study explores two frameworks for constructing EoSs with first-order phase transitions: the polytropic interpolation method and the randomized speed-of-sound interpolation approach. It is found that the mass-radius relation and pressure vs. energy density relation are blind towards the thermodynamic consistency check. The polytropic interpolation method can exhibit discontinuities in the chemical potential for first-order phase transition, raising concerns regarding potential causality violations and thermodynamic inconsistencies. In contrast, the speed of sound interpolation approach ensures continuity in the chemical potential, offering a more thermodynamically consistent and reliable framework. Moreover, the sound speed method effectively captures the softer segment of the mass-radius spectrum, a capability not achieved by the consistent piecewise-polytropic approach due to its monotonic stiffness constraints. The speed of sound definition involving number density and chemical potential reveals the thermodynamic inconsistency, making it a more consistent and robust definition. These findings underscore the importance of thermodynamic consistency in EoS construction and highlight the advantages of the randomized speed-of-sound method for modelling phase transitions in dense matter.
#### Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) as an Extraterrestrial Atmospheric Technosignature

 - **Abstract**
 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons are prevalent in the universe and interstellar medium but are primarily attributed to anthropogenic sources on Earth, such as fossil fuel combustion and firewood burning. Drawing upon the idea of PAHs as suitable candidates for technosignatures, we investigate the detectability of those PAHs that have available absorption cross-sections in the atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets (orbiting G-type stars at a distance of 10 parsecs) with an 8m mirror of Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Specifically, we focus on Naphthalene, Anthracene, Phenanthrene, and Pyrene. Our simulations indicate that under current Earth-like conditions, detecting PAH signatures between 0.2-0.515 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ is infeasible. To account for the historical decline in PAH production post-industrial revolution, we explore varying PAH concentrations to assess instrumental capabilities to detect civilizations resembling modern Earth. We also evaluate telescope architectures (6m, 8m, and 10m mirror diameters) to put our results into the context of the future HWO mission. With these four molecules, PAH detection remains infeasible, even at concentrations ten times higher than current levels. While larger mirrors provide some advantages, they fail to resolve the spectral signatures of these molecules with significant signal-to-noise ratios. The UV absorption features of PAHs, caused by $\mathrm{\pi}$-orbital $\rightarrow$ $\mathrm{\pi^*}$-orbital electronic transitions, serve as valuable markers due to their distinct and detectable nature, preserved by the aromatic stability of PAHs. Additional lab measurements are necessary to gather absorption cross-section data beyond UV for more abundant PAHs. This may help further in improving the detectability of these molecules.
#### Determining the nature of IC 10 X-2: A comprehensive study of the Optical/Infrared emission from an extragalactic BeHMXB

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the optical and infrared (IR) properties of high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) IC 10 X-2, classified as a super-giant HMXB and super-fast X-ray transient (SFXT) by previous work. Our analysis of regular (daily and weekly) observations by both the Zwicky Transient Factory and Las Cumbres Observatory over a ~5 year period indicates both periodic flares and variations in the apparent magnitude and color with a $\sim26.5$~d period -- likely the orbital period of this binary system. The periodic flaring suggests the stellar companion is a Be star, with flares resulting from increased accretion onto the neutron star when it enters the stellar decretion disk. The periodic variations in the optical/IR brightness and color likely result from orbital variations in the Hydrogen column density along the line of sight or a transient accretion disk around the neutron star. Lastly, the numerous, short duration, episodes where IC 10 X-2 is significantly ``redder'' or ``bluer'' than normal likely result from from clumps within this system -- which can accrete onto the neutron star (causing IC 10 X-2 to appear bluer), or pass through the line of sight (causing IC 10 X-2 to appear redder). These results substantially increase our understanding of the evolution of this source, a significant source of ionizing photons in its host galaxy IC 10, a low mass, metal-poor starburst galaxy similar in many respect to those thought to be common in the early Universe.
#### BATSRUS GPU: Faster-than-Real-Time Magnetospheric Simulations with a Block-Adaptive Grid Code

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06717

 - **Abstract**
 BATSRUS, our state-of-the-art extended magnetohydrodynamic code, is the most used and one of the most resource-consuming models in the Space Weather Modeling Framework. It has always been our objective to improve its efficiency and speed with emerging techniques, such as GPU acceleration. To utilize the GPU nodes on modern supercomputers, we port BATSRUS to GPUs with the OpenACC API. Porting the code to a single GPU requires rewriting and optimizing the most used functionalities of the original code into a new solver, which accounts for around 1% of the entire program in length. To port it to multiple GPUs, we implement a new message passing algorithm to support its unique block-adaptive grid feature. We conduct weak scaling tests on as many as 256 GPUs and find good performance. The program has 50-60% parallel efficiency on up to 256 GPUs, and up to 95% efficiency within a single node (4 GPUs). Running large problems on more than one node has reduced efficiency due to hardware bottlenecks. We also demonstrate our ability to run representative magnetospheric simulations on GPUs. The performance for a single A100 GPU is about the same as 270 AMD "Rome" CPU cores, and it runs 3.6 times faster than real time. The simulation can run 6.9 times faster than real time on four A100 GPUs.
#### Tracking Outflow using Line-Locking (TOLL). II. Large Line-Locking Web identified in Quasar J151352+085555

 - **Abstract**
 Quasar outflows often consist of two clouds with velocity separations matching the doublet spacings of common UV resonance transitions, a phenomenon known as line-locking, which is commonly observed in quasar spectra. Multiple clouds can be locked together through multi-ion doublets, forming 'line-locking web'. In the second paper of the TOLL project, we present discovery of one of the largest 'line-locking web' known to date from the VLT/UVES spectra of QSO J151352+085555. We identify 12 associated narrow absorption line systems through the C IV, N V, Si IV, O VI, and multiple Lyman lines (Ly${\alpha}$ to Ly${\epsilon}$), and find 10 out of the 12 absorbers are line-locked together by comparing velocity separations between different absorption systems. By conducting photoionization modeling with CLOUDY, we measure the total hydrogen column densities, metallicities, and ionization parameters of these absorbers, which suggests the absorbers likely have sub-solar metallicities. A preliminary statistical analysis demonstrates the shadowed clouds tend to have similar ionization states comparing to the shadowing ones. Identification of one of the largest line-locking webs implies that radiative acceleration plays an important role in sorting out cloud velocities in quasar outflows, and highlights the need for more sophisticated theoretical models to explain its formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars can end their lives with a successful supernova explosion (leaving behind a neutron star or, more rarely, a black hole), or a failed explosion that leaves behind a black hole. The density structure of the pre-collapse progenitor star already encodes much of the information regarding the outcome and properties of the explosion. However, the complexity of the collapse and subsequent shock expansion phases prevents drawing a straightforward connection between the pre-collapse and post-explosion properties. In order to derive such a connection several explodability studies have been performed in recent years. However, different studies can predict different explosion outcomes. In this article, we show how compactness, which is related to the average density of the star's core, has an important role in determining the efficiency of neutrino heating, and therefore the outcome of the explosion. Commonly, high-compactness progenitors are assumed to yield failed explosions, due to their large mass accretion rates, preventing the shock from expanding. We show by analyzing $\sim$ 150 2D FLASH and Fornax simulations and 20 3D Fornax simulations that this is not the case. Instead, due to the rapid increase of neutrino heating with compactness, high-compactness progenitors lead to successful shock revival. We also show that 1D+ simulations that include $\nu$-driven convection using a mixing-length theory approach correctly reproduce this trend. Finally, we compare 1D+ models, which we show can reproduce some aspects of multi-D simulations with reasonable accuracy, with other widely used 1D models in the literature.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06891

 - **Abstract**
 A remarkable feature of dark matter consisting of ultralight bosonic particles is the emergence of superfluid Bose-Einstein condensate structures on galactic scales. We investigate the oscillations of the solitonic dark matter structure in the central galactic region by numerically solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes problem, accounting for perturbations in the gravitational potential and local self-interactions. Our findings reveal that the central solitonic core, formed by the balance of gravitational attraction, quantum pressure, and repulsive interactions, exhibits significant oscillatory behaviour. These oscillations, characterized by distinct eigenmodes, provide insights into the dynamical properties of solitonic dark matter structures and their observational implications and contributions to galactic structure formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Weak lensing mass mapping algorithms, which reconstruct the convergence field from galaxy shear measurements, are crucial for extracting higher-order statistics to constrain cosmological parameters. However, only limited research has explored whether the choice of mass mapping algorithm affects the inference of cosmological parameters from weak lensing higher-order statistics. This study aims to evaluate the impact of different mass mapping algorithms on the inference of cosmological parameters measured with weak lensing peak counts. We employ Kaiser-Squires, inpainting Kaiser-Squires, and MCALens mass mapping algorithms to reconstruct the convergence field from simulated weak lensing data. Using these maps, we compute the peak counts and wavelet peak counts as data vectors and perform Bayesian analysis with MCMC sampling to estimate posterior distributions of cosmological parameters. Our results indicate that the choice of mass mapping algorithm significantly affects the constraints on cosmological parameters, with the MCALens method improving constraints by up to 157$\%$ compared to the standard Kaiser-Squires method. This improvement arises from MCALens' ability to better capture small-scale structures. In contrast, inpainting Kaiser-Squires yields constraints similar to Kaiser-Squires, indicating limited benefit from inpainting for cosmological parameter estimation with peaks. The accuracy of mass mapping algorithms is thus critical for cosmological inference from weak lensing data. Advanced algorithms like MCALens, which offer superior reconstruction of the convergence field, can substantially enhance the precision of cosmological parameter estimates. These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate mass mapping techniques in weak lensing studies to fully exploit the potential of higher-order statistics for cosmological research.
#### AAS2RTO: Automated Alert Streams to Real-Time Observations: Preparing for rapid follow-up of transient objects in the era of LSST

 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will discover tens of thousands of astrophysical transients per night, far outpacing available spectroscopic follow-up capabilities. Carefully prioritising candidates for follow-up observations will maximise the scientific return from small telescopes with a single-object spectrograph. We introduce AAS2RTO, an astrophysical transient candidate prioritisation tool written in Python. AAS2RTO is flexible in that any number of criteria that consider observed properties of transients can be implemented. The visibility of candidates from a given observing site is also considered. The prioritised list of candidates provided by AAS2RTO is continually updated when new transient data are made available. Therefore, it can be applied to observing campaigns with a wide variety of scientific motivations. AAS2RTO uses a greedy algorithm to prioritise candidates. Candidates are represented by a single numerical value, or `score'. Scores are computed by constructing simple numerical factors which individually consider the competing facets of a candidate which make it suitable for follow-up observation. AAS2RTO is currently configured to work primarily with photometric data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), distributed by certified LSST community brokers. We provide an example of how AAS2RTO can be used by defining a set of criteria to prioritise observations of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) close to peak brightness, in preparation for observations with the spectrograph at the Danish-1.54m telescope. Using a sample of archival alerts from ZTF, we evaluate the criteria we have designed to estimate the number of SNe Ia that we will be able to observe with a 1.5m telescope. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our criteria when applied to mock LSST observations of SNe Ia.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the structural and observable impacts of dark matter (DM) on neutron stars using a combined equation of state that integrates the relativistic mean field (RMF) model for baryonic matter with a variable density profile for DM, incorporating DM-baryon interactions mediated by the Higgs field. Employing three RMF parameter sets (NL3, BigApple, and IOPB-I) for baryonic matter, we analyze mass-radius relations, maximum mass, and tidal deformability, focusing on DM density scaling ($\alpha$) and steepness ($\beta$) parameters. Our findings reveal that increased DM concentration significantly enhances NS compactness, shifting mass-radius profiles and reducing tidal deformability. The DM influence strongly depends on the steepness of the DM density profile, where high $\beta$ values lead to strongly confined DM within the NS core, resulting in more compact and less deformable configurations. Observational constraints from PSR J0740+6620 and GW170817 impose consistent structural limits on DM fractions across different equations of state models, narrowing the allowable parameter space for DM and linking specific combinations of $\alpha M_{\chi}$ ($M_{\chi}$ being the mass of dark matter particle) and $\beta$ values to viable NS structures. This study highlights the interplay among DM concentration, nuclear stiffness, and observational data in shaping NS structure, offering insights into future constraints on DM in high-density astrophysical environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova 2018ibb of the PISN category related to the dynamical instability of oxygen core in a supermassive star induced by pair-creation shows at the nebular stage strong [\oiii] emission lines of an uncertain origin. I propose a simple model that demonstrates a possibility of [O III] lines emission from the supernova oxygen matter ionized and heated by the $^{56}$Co radioactive decay. The reason is pinpointed by which the [O III] line luminosity among supernovae of PISN category can vary in a broad range.
#### Effects of inner crusts on $g$-mode oscillations in neutron stars

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07188

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we investigate the influence of neutron stars' crusts on the non-radial $g$-mode oscillations and examine their correlations with nuclear matter properties fixed by adopting 10 different relativistic density functionals. At subsaturation densities, neutron star matter takes non-uniform structures and form the crusts. We find that the Brunt-Väisälä (BV) frequency increases significantly at densities slightly above the neutron drip density (i.e., neutron stars' inner crusts), which leads to crust $g$-mode oscillations with their frequencies insensitive to the adopted density functional. At larger densities, BV frequency increases as well due to the core-crust transitions and emergence of muons, which lead to core $g$-mode oscillations. It is found that the obtained core $g$-mode frequencies generally increase with the slope of nuclear symmetry energy $L$, which eventually intersect with that of the crust $g$ modes adopting large enough $L$. This leads to the avoid-crossing phenomenon for the global $g$ modes that encompass contributions from both the crust and core. The correlation between the global $g_1$ mode and $L$ is identified for neutron stars with masses $M\gtrsim 1.4\ M_{\odot}$, which enables the measurements of $L$ based on gravitational wave observations. In our future study, the effects of the discontinuities in density or shear modulus should be considered, while the temperature, rotation, magnetic field, and superfluid neutron gas in neutron stars could also play important roles.
#### Do tides play a role in the determination of the pre-stellar core mass function?

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies have examined the role of tides in the star formation process. They suggest, notably, that the tides determine the characteristic mass of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) by preventing the collapse of density fluctuations that would become gravitationally unstable in the absence of the tidal field generated by a neighboring central mass. However, most of these studies consider the tidal collapse condition as a 1D process or use a scalar virial condition and thus neglect the anisotropy of the tidal field and its compressive effects. In the present paper, we consider a turbulence-induced density perturbation formed in the envelope of a central core. This perturbation is subject to a tidal field generated by the central core. We study its evolution taking dynamical effects and the anisotropy of the tides into account. Based on the general tensorial virial equations, we determine a new collapse condition that takes these mechanisms into account. We identify two regimes: (i) a weak tidal regime in which the dynamics of the perturbation is only slightly modified by the action of the tides and (ii) a strong tidal regime in which the density threshold for collapse can potentially be increased due to the combined effects of the tides and the rotational support generated by the tidal synchronization of the perturbation with the orbital motion. In the case of a turbulence-induced density perturbation formed in the vicinity of a first Larson core, we show that the density threshold above which the perturbation collapses is increased only for low-mass perturbations (less than 2.7 solar mass) and only by at most a factor of 1.5. We conclude that tides likely do not play a major role in the process of star formation or in the determination of the characteristic mass of the IMF. We propose an alternative explanation for the observed value of the characteristic mass of the IMF.

 - **Abstract**
 The Guitar nebula surrounding PSR B2224+65 boasts a pulsar X-ray filament likely aligned with the local magnetic field. We present new RoboPol stellar polarization data distributed along the line-of-sight to the pulsar. The polarizing effect of intervening magnetized dust allows us to extract a model for the dust-weighted magnetic field. We detect a magnetic field angle consistent with the filament if the pulsar is located in the more distant zone of its parallax-estimated distance range.
