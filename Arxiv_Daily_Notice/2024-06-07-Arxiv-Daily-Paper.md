 - **Abstract**
 GWnext 2024 was a meeting held in the Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at Peking University in March $4^\text{th} - 8^\text{th}$, 2024. In the meeting researchers at different career stages -- with a particular focus on early career scientists -- working on the different aspects of gravitational wave (GW) astronomy gathered to discuss the current status as well as prospects of the field. The meeting was divided into three core sessions: Astrophysics, GW Theory, and Detection. Each session consisted of introductory talks and extended discussion sessions. Moreover, there was a poster session where students could present their results. In this paper, we summarize the results presented during the meeting and present the most important outcomes.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the prospects for detecting and constraining density and temperature inhomogeneities in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) using absorption measurements of metal ions. Distributions in the gas thermal properties could arise from turbulence, gas cooling from the hot phase, and mixing between the cool and hot phases. Focusing on these physically motivated models, we parameterize each with a single parameter for simplicity and provide empirical and theoretical estimates for reasonable parameter values. We then construct the probability distribution functions for each of these scenarios, calculate the effective ion fractions, and fit our models to the COS-Halos absorption measurements to infer the gas densities and metallicities. We find that the models we consider (i) produce similarly good fits to the observations with or without distributions in the gas thermal properties, and (ii) result in detectable changes in the column densities only at the boundaries of reasonable parameter values. We show that He II self-shielding can have a larger effect on the ion fractions than density and temperature fluctuations. As a result, uncertainties in cloud geometry and their spatial distribution, affecting the details of radiation transfer, may obscure the effect of inhomogeneities.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.3 mm continuum and CO(2-1) line emission observations toward the high-mass star formation region DR21. Five new continuum sources are found. We identify eighteen outflow streamers detected in CO emission radially arising from a common origin. The velocity spread of the outflow streamers range between $-$100 to $+$70 km s$^{-1}$. The radial velocities of each outflow roughly follow linear gradients (Hubble-Lemaitre-like expansion motions). Using the CO emission of the whole ensemble of streamers we estimate a total outflow mass of 120-210M$_{\odot}$. Additionally, we derived the dynamical age (8600 yr), momentum ($\sim10^{3}$ M$_{\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$), and kinetic energy ($\sim10^{48}$ erg) of the outflow. The morphology and kinematics presented by the CO outflow streamers confirm the presence of an explosive dispersal outflow at the heart of DR21. Five dispersal explosive outflows associated with massive star-forming regions have been confirmed in our Galaxy (Orion BN/KL, G5.89-0.39, S106-IR, IRAS16076-5134 and IRAS 12326-6245). However, their frequency of occurrence in the Galaxy and the originating nature are still uncertain.

 - **Abstract**
 This study is aimed to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular hydrogen distribution in the galaxy M33 by introducing novel methods for generating high angular resolution (18.2$''$, equivalent to 75 pc) column density maps of molecular hydrogen ($N_{\rm H_2}$). M33 is a local group galaxy that has been observed with Herschel in the far-infrared wavelength range from 70 to 500 $\mum$. Previous studies have presented total hydrogen column density maps ($N_{\rm H}$), using these FIR data (partly combined with mid-IR maps), employing various methods. We first performed a spectral energy distribution fit to the 160, 250, 350, and 500 $\mum$ continuum data obtain $N_{\rm H}$, using a technique similar to one previously reported in the literature. We also use a second method which involves translating only the 250 $\mum$ map into a $N_{\rm H}$ map at the same angular resolution. An $N_{\rm H_2}$ map via each method is then obtained by subtracting the HI component. Distinguishing our study from previous ones, we adopt a more versatile approach by considering a variable emissivity index, $\beta$ and dust absorption coefficient, $\kappa_0$. This choice enables us to construct a $\kappa_0$ map, thereby enhancing the depth and accuracy of our investigation of the hydrogen column density. We address the inherent biases and challenges within both methods (which give similar results) and compare them with existing maps available in the literature. Moreover, we calculate a map of the carbon monoxide CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor (\Xco\ factor), which shows a strong dispersion around an average value of $1.8\times10^{20}\,\cmKkms$ throughout the disk. We obtain column density probability distribution functions (N-PDFs) from the $N_{\rm H}$, $N_{\rm H_2}$, and $N_{HI}$ maps and discuss their shape, consisting of several log-normal and power-law tail components.

 - **Abstract**
 Feedback driven massive outflows play a crucial role in galaxy evolution by regulating star formation and influencing the dynamics of surrounding media. Extracting outflow properties from spectral lines is a notoriously difficult process for a number of reasons, including the possibility that a substantial fraction of the outflow is carried by dense gas in a very narrow range in velocity. This gas can hide in spectra with insufficient resolution. Empirically motivated analysis based on the Apparent Optical Depth method, commonly used in the literature, neglects the contribution of this gas, and may therefore underestimate the true gas column density. More complex semi-analytical line transfer (e.g., SALT) models, on the other hand, allow for the presence of this gas by modeling the radial density and velocity of the outflows as power laws. Here we compare the two approaches to quantify the uncertainties in the inferences of outflow properties based on 1-D "down-the-barrel" using the UV spectra of the CLASSY galaxy sample. We find that empirical modeling may significantly underestimate the column densities relative to SALT analysis, particularly in the optically thick regime. We use simulations to show that the main reason for this discrepancy is the presence of large amount of dense material at low velocities, which can be hidden by the finite spectral resolution of the data. The SALT models in turn could over-estimate the column densities if the assumed power laws of the density profiles strong are not a property of actual outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration flashes with unknown origins. Its formation rate is crucial for unveiling physical origins. However, the luminosity and formation rate are degenerated when directly fitting the redshift distribution of FRBs. In contrast to previous forward-fitting methods, we use the Lynden-Bell's $c^{-}$ method to derive luminosity function and formation rate of FRBs without any assumptions. Using the non-repeating FRBs from the first CHIME/FRB catalog, we find a relatively strong luminosity evolution, and luminosity function can be fitted by a broken power-law model with a break at $1.33\times10^{41}\ \mathrm{erg}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The formation rate declines rapidly as $(1+z)^{-4.9\pm0.3}$ with a local rate $1.13\times10^4\ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. This monotonic decrease is similar to the rate of short gamma-ray bursts. After comparing it with star formation rate and stellar mass density, we conclude that the old populations including neutron stars and black holes, are closely related to the origins of FRBs. Monte Carlo simulations are used to test our results. The distributions of mock sample are consistent with the observational data.
#### Shockingly Bright Warm Carbon Monoxide Molecular Features in the Supernova Remnant Cassiopeia A Revealed by JWST

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST NIRCam (F356W and F444W filters) and MIRI (F770W) images and NIRSpec- IFU spectroscopy of the young supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A). We obtained the data as part of a JWST survey of Cas A. The NIRCam and MIRI images map the spatial distributions of synchrotron radiation, Ar-rich ejecta, and CO on both large and small scales, revealing remarkably complex structures. The CO emission is stronger at the outer layers than the Ar ejecta, which indicates the reformation of CO molecules behind the reverse shock. NIRSpec-IFU spectra (3 - 5.5 microns) were obtained toward two representative knots in the NE and S fields. Both regions are dominated by the bright fundamental rovibrational band of CO in the two R and P branches, with strong [Ar VI] and relatively weaker, variable strength ejecta lines of [Si IX], [Ca IV], [Ca V] and [Mg IV]. The NIRSpec-IFU data resolve individual ejecta knots and filaments spatially and in velocity space. The fundamental CO band in the JWST spectra reveals unique shapes of CO, showing a few tens of sinusoidal patterns of rovibrational lines with pseudo-continuum underneath, which is attributed to the high-velocity widths of CO lines. The CO also shows high J lines at different vibrational transitions. Our results with LTE modeling of CO emission indicate a temperature of 1080 K and provide unique insight into the correlations between dust, molecules, and highly ionized ejecta in supernovae, and have strong ramifications for modeling dust formation that is led by CO cooling in the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Redshift estimation and the classification of gamma-ray AGNs represent crucial challenges in the field of gamma-ray astronomy. Recent efforts have been made to tackle these problems using traditional machine learning methods. However, the simplicity of existing algorithms, combined with their basic implementations, underscores an opportunity and a need for further advancement in this area. Our approach begins by implementing a Bayesian model for redshift estimation, which can account for uncertainty while providing predictions with the desired confidence level. Subsequently, we address the classification problem by leveraging intelligent initialization techniques and employing soft voting. Additionally, we explore several potential self-supervised algorithms in their conventional form. Lastly, in addition to generating predictions for data with missing outputs, we ensure that the theoretical assertions put forth by both algorithms mutually reinforce each other.

 - **Abstract**
 In spite of significant progress in the research of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in recent decade, their origin is still under extensive debate. Investigation on the population of FRBs can provide new insight into this interesting problem. In this paper, based on the first CHIME/FRB catalog, we construct a Bayesian framework to analyze the FRB population, with the selection effect of the CHIME telescope being properly taken into account. The energy function is modeled as the power-law with an exponential cutoff. Four redshift distribution models are considered, i.e., the star formation history (SFH) model, and three time-delayed models (Gaussian delay, log-normal delay, and power-law delay). The free parameters are simultaneously constrained using Bayesian inference method, and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is used in model comparison. According to BIC, the log-normal delay model fits the data best. The power-law delay model and Gaussian delay model can also give reasonable fits, although they are not as good as the log-normal delay model. However, the SFH model is strongly disfavored compared with the three time-delayed models. The energy function is tightly constrained and is almost independent of the redshift models, with the best-fitting power-law index $\alpha\approx 1.8$, and cut-off energy $\log(E_c/{\rm erg})\approx 42$. The FRB population shows on average $3\sim 5$ billion years time delay with respect to the SFH. Therefore, the hypothesis that the FRB population traces the SFH is conclusively ruled out.

 - **Abstract**
 Progenitor stars of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) could be surrounded by a significant and complex nebula structure lying at a parsec scale distance. After the initial release of energy from the GRB jet, the jet will interact with this nebula environment. We show here that for a large, plausible parameter space region, the interaction between the jet blastwave and the wind termination (reverse) shock is expected to be weak, and may be associated with a precursor emission. As the jet blast wave encounters the contact discontinuity separating the shocked wind and the shocked interstellar medium, we find that a bright flash of synchrotron emission from the newly-formed reverse shock is produced. This flash is expected to be observed at around ~100 s after the initial explosion and precursor. Such a delayed emission thus constitutes a circumburst medium (CBM) phase in a GRB, having a physically distinct origin from the preceding prompt phase and the succeeding afterglow phase. The CBM phase emission may thus provide a natural explanation to bursts observed to have a precursor followed by an intense, synchrotron-dominated main episode that is found in a substantial minority, ~10% of GRBs. A correct identification of the emission phase is thus required to infer the properties of the flow and of the immediate environment around GRB progenitors.
#### The Vela Pulsar Progenitor Was Most Likely a Binary Merger

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar evolution theory restricted to single stars predicts a minimum mass for core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) of around eight solar masses; this minimum mass corresponds to a maximum age of around 45 million years for the progenitor and the coeval population of stars. Binary evolution complicates this prediction. For example, an older stellar population around 100 million years could contain stellar mergers that reach the minimum mass for core collapse. Despite this clear prediction by binary evolution, there are few, if any CCSNe associated with a distinctly older stellar population...until now. The stellar population within 150 pc of the Vela Pulsar is inconsistent with single-star evolution only; instead, the most likely solution is that the stellar population is $\ge$80 Myr old, and the brightest stars are mass gainers and/or mergers, the result of binary evolution. The evidence is as follows. Even though the main sequence is clearly dominated by a $\ge$80-Myr-old population, a large fraction of the corresponding red giants is missing. The best-fitting single-star model expects 51.5 red giants, yet there are only 22; the Poisson probability of this is $1.7 \times 10^{-6}$. In addition, there is an overabundance of bright, young-looking stars (25-30 Myrs old), yet there is not a corresponding young main sequence (MS). Upon closer inspection, the vast majority of the young-looking stars show either past or current signs of binary evolution. These new results are possible due to exquisite Gaia parallaxes and a new age-dating software called {\it Stellar Ages}.
#### Photometric Classification of Stars Around the Milky Way's Central Black Hole: I. Central Parsec

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of young massive stars in the Galactic Centre (GC) raises questions about star formation near the black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Additionally, the initial mass function (IMF) in this region appears different from the standard Salpeter/Kroupa law. Extreme extinction and crowding limit our understanding of the stellar population, with spectroscopic data available only for selected bright sources. We aim to improve knowledge about the distribution and IMF of young, massive stars near Sgr A*. Using intermediate band (IB) photometry, we identify candidates for massive young stars through Bayesian inference, a neural network, and a gradient-boosted trees algorithm. We obtained spectral energy distributions for 6590 stars, 1181 of which have been previously classified spectroscopically. We identify 351 stars classified as early types by all three methods, including 155 newly identified candidates. The radial density profiles for late and early-type stars fit broken power laws, with a break radius of 9.2 +- 0.6'' for early-type stars. Late-type stars show a core-like distribution around Sgr A*, while early-type stars' density increases steeply towards the black hole. We infer a top-heavy IMF of young stars near Sgr A* (R < 9''), with a power-law of 1.6 +- 0.1. At greater distances, a standard Salpeter/Kroupa IMF fits the data. IB photometry also constrains the metallicities of late-type stars, estimating metallicities for over 600 stars. The IMF variation with radial distance suggests different star formation mechanisms, with a top-heavy IMF near Sgr A* consistent with disc star formation.
