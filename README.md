 - **Abstract**
 Most of our knowledge regarding molecular clouds and the early stages of star formation stems from molecular spectral-line observations. However, the various chemical and radiative-transfer effects, in combination with projection effects, can lead to a distorted view of molecular clouds. Our objective is to simultaneously study all of these effects by creating synthetic spectral-line observations based on a chemo-dynamical simulation of a collapsing molecular cloud. We performed a 3D ideal MHD simulation of a supercritical turbulent collapsing molecular cloud where the dynamical evolution was coupled to a nonequilibrium gas-grain chemical network consisting of 115 species, the evolution of which was governed by >1600 chemical reactions. We post-processed this simulation with a multilevel non-LTE radiative-transfer code to produce synthetic PPV data cubes of the CO, HCO+, HCN, and N2H+ (J = 1-0) transitions under various projection angles with respect to the mean component of the magnetic field. We find that the chemical abundances of various species in our simulated cloud tend to be over-predicted in comparison to observationally derived abundances and attribute this discrepancy to the fact that the cloud collapses rapidly and therefore the various species do not have enough time to deplete onto dust grains. This suggests that our initial conditions may not correspond to the initial conditions of real molecular clouds and cores. We show that the projection angle has a notable effect on the moment maps of the species for which we produced synthetic observations. Specifically, the integrated emission and velocity dispersion of CO, HCO+, and HCN are higher when the cloud is observed "face on" compared to "edge on," whereas column density maps exhibit an opposite trend. Finally, we show that only N2H+ is an accurate tracer of the column density of the cloud across all projection angles.
#### Projection-angle effects when "observing" a turbulent magnetized collapsing molecular cloud. II. Magnetic field

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar magnetic fields are thought to play a fundamental role in the evolution of star-forming regions. Polarized thermal dust emission serves as a key probe for understanding the structure of the POS component of the magnetic field. However, inclination effects can significantly influence the apparent morphology of the magnetic field and lead to erroneous conclusions regarding its dynamical importance. Our aim is to investigate how projection-angle effects impact dust polarization maps and to explore new ways for accessing the inclination angle of the mean component of the magnetic field with respect to the POS. We post-processed a 3D ideal MHD simulation of a turbulent collapsing molecular cloud and produced synthetic dust polarization measurements under various projection angles, ranging from "face-on" (i.e., viewed along the mean magnetic field direction) to "edge-on" (perpendicular to the mean magnetic field direction). Additionally, we used synthetic PPV data cubes from the CO (J = 1-0) transition, presented in a companion paper. The projected magnetic-field morphology is found to be highly affected by the projection angle with the hourglass morphology being clearly visible only for projection angles close to edge-on. We find that the direction of the apparent "flow" between successive velocity channels in the simulated PPV data cubes shows an increasing correlation with the synthetic dust polarization observations, as the cloud is observed closer to an edge-on orientation. Based on this property, we developed a new method to probe the inclination angle of the magnetic field relative to the POS. We validated our approach by generating additional synthetic data (PPV cubes and polarization maps) at an earlier stage of the cloud's evolution and demonstrated an excellent quantitative agreement between the derived inclination angle and the true observational angle.

 - **Abstract**
 Saturn raises a time-dependent tide on its small moon Enceladus, due to the eccentricity of the orbit. As shown in a companion paper (Goldreich et al.), the resulting tidal heating drives Enceladus into a limit cycle, in which its eccentricity and shell thickness vary in tandem, on a timescale of ~ 10 Myr. The limit cycle explains a variety of observed phenomena on Enceladus, including its large luminosity and cracked ice shell. Here we derive the tidal heating rate needed for that study, starting from a simple first-principles derivation of Enceladus's tidal response. Enceladus is comprised of three layers: a rocky core, an outer ice shell, and an ocean sandwiched in between. Tides force the shell to librate and distort, which generates heat. We calculate the libration amplitude and tidal heating rate by minimizing the sum of elastic and gravitational energies. The final expressions are analytic, and account for the finite hardness of the shell, and for resonant libration. Although we specialize to Enceladus, our approach may be extended to other bodies that have a similar three layer structure, such as Europa and Titan.
#### The stochastic nature of migration of disc instability protoplanets in three-dimensional hydrodynamical and MHD simulations of fragmenting discs

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of the nature of migration of protoplanetary clumps formed via disc instability in self-consistent 3D hydrodynamical (HD) and magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of self-gravitating discs. Motivated by the complex structure of protoplanetary clumps we do not introduce sink particles. We find that the orbital evolution of the clumps has a stochastic character but also exhibits recurrent properties over many orbits. Clump migration is governed by two sources of gravitational torques: a torque originating from a region about twice the Hill sphere around each clump's orbit, and the torque resulting from clump-clump interactions. Compared to non-magnetized companion runs, the latter are more frequent in MHD simulations, which give rise to more numerous clumps starting off at smaller masses, often below a Neptune mass. Clump-clump interactions can lead to temporary strong accelerations of migration in both directions, but integrated over time provide a lesser impact than disc-driven torques. They can also lead to clump mergers but do not cause ejections; a difference to previous works which adopted sink particles. The local "Hill torque" is responsible for the fast migration, inward or outward. Estimating the characteristic timescales of conventional migration in our regime, we find that the disc-driven migration timescales are in agreement with Type III migration. However, the dominant local torque is rapidly fluctuating, which reflects the turbulent nature of the flow. The resulting stochastic migration pattern is markedly different from Type III runaway migration and appears to be a distinctive feature of orbital dynamics in a fragmenting disc.

 - **Abstract**
 The new era of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy will significantly improve our understanding of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) by providing precise constraints on its underlying physical properties. However, spectral fitting requires reasonable assumptions on the thermal and chemical distributions of the gas. We use the output of TNG-Cluster, the newest addition to the IllustrisTNG suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations, to provide theoretical expectations for the multi-phase nature of the ICM across hundreds of z=0 clusters (M$_{500c}$ = 10$^{14.0-15.3}$ M$_\odot$) based upon a realistic model for galaxy formation and evolution. We create and analyse, in an observer-like manner, end-to-end XRISM/Resolve mock observations towards cluster centres. We then systematically compare the intrinsic properties of the simulated gas with the inferred ones from spectral fitting via a variety of commonly used spectral-emission models. Our analysis suggests that models with a distribution of temperatures, such as bvlognorm and bvgadem, better describe the complex thermal structure of the ICM, as predicted by TNG-Cluster, but incur biases of 0.5-2 keV (16th-84th percentiles). The 1T bvapec is too simplistic for the predicted broad temperature distributions, while a 2T double bvapec model systematically fails to capture the input temperature structure. However, all spectral emission models systematically underestimate the Fe abundance of the central ICM by ~0.1 Solar (~ 20 per cent) primarily due to projection effects. Selecting only strong cool core clusters leads to minor improvements on inference quality, removing the majority of outliers but maintaining similar overall biases and cluster-to-cluster scatter.

 - **Abstract**
 The majority of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitors are massive stars in multiple systems, and their evolution and final fate are affected by interactions with their companions. These interactions can explain the presence of circumstellar material in many CCSNe, and the inferred low mass in stripped-envelope supernova progenitors. Through binary interactions, stars can gain mass, lose mass, or merge, impacting their final properties. Specific sub-types of binary interaction products have been investigated but few detailed full population models exist. Using {thousands of} detailed simulations with updated prescriptions for binary interactions and winds at Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds metallicities, we follow the evolution of single massive stars, primaries in interacting binaries and coalescence products following common envelope evolution. We also follow the evolution of the surviving secondary star, with a compact companion formed from the evolutionary end of the primary star or alone if the system was disrupted in the first supernova. The endpoints of our simulations map the rich landscape of CCSN progenitors, and provide detailed mass-loss history and progenitor structures. We identify an important evolutionary phase for stripped-envelope supernova progenitors, in which the wind mass-loss rate of stars stripped by binary interaction rapidly increases in their final evolutionary stages, after core helium burning. These strong winds would give rise to a Wolf-Rayet (WR) spectral appearance, though only for a few millennia, in contrast to hundreds of millennia for their more massive WR counterparts. Such lightweight WR stars in binaries can account for observed properties of type Ib/c supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 The red hypergiant VY CMa is remarkable for its very visible record of high mass loss events observed over the range of wavelengths from the optical and infrared to the submillimeter region with ALMA. The SW Clump or SW knots are unique in the ejecta of VY CMa. Except for the central star, they are the brightest sources of dusty infrared emission in its complex ejecta. In this paper we combine the proper motions from the HST images, and infrared fluxes from 2 to 12 microns with the 12CO images from ALMA to determine their ages and mass estimates. The SW knots were ejected more than 200 years ago with an active period lasting about 30 years, and with a total mass in the Clump more than 0.02 Solar masses.

 - **Abstract**
 Young associations provide a record that traces the star formation process, and the youngest populations connect progenitor gas dynamics to the resulting stellar populations. We therefore conduct the first comprehensive overview of the Circinus Complex, an under-studied and massive ($\sim$1500 M$_{\odot}$) region consisting of approximately 3100 recently formed stars alongside the Circinus Molecular Cloud (CMC). We find a clear age pattern in the contiguous central region (CirCe), where younger stars are found further from the massive central cluster, and where the velocities are consistent with uniform expansion. By comparing this structure to an analogous STARFORGE simulation, we find that the age structure and dynamics of the association are consistent with star formation in two stages: the global collapse of the parent cloud that builds the $500 M_{\odot}$ central cluster ASCC 79, followed by triggered star formation in a shell swept up after the first massive stars form. We also find that filaments with a range of distances from the central cluster can naturally produce multi-generational age sequences due to differences in feedback strength and exposure. Outlying populations show velocities consistent with formation independent from the CirCe region, but with similar enough velocities that they may be difficult to distinguish from one another later in their expansion. We therefore provide a new alternative view of sequential star formation that relies on feedback from a single central cluster rather than the multiple sequential generations that are traditionally invoked, while also providing insight into the star formation history of older populations.
#### Convective Overstability in Radially Global Protoplanetary Disks. II. Impact on planetesimal formation

 - **Abstract**
 The Convective Overstability (COS) is a hydrodynamic instability occurring in protoplanetary disk (PPD) regions with an adverse radial entropy gradient. It is a potential driver of turbulence and may influence planetesimal formation. In this second paper of our series, we study the effects of the COS on dust dynamics in radially global PPD simulations, focusing on the mid-plane region, where vertical gravity on the dust is included. Axisymmetric 2D simulations show susceptibility to both the COS and the Vertically Shearing Streaming Instability. For a Stokes number tau = 0.1, strong dust clumping occurs only for highly super-solar initial metallicities Z greater than 0.05. In 3D non-axisymmetric simulations, the COS generates large-scale, long-lived vortices that have the potential to efficiently concentrate dust, with dust accumulation strengthening as tau increases. For tau = 0.01, no strong clumping occurs even at metallicities as high as Z = 0.1, and vortices remain robust and long-lived. At tau = 0.04, strong dust clumping is observed for solar metallicity (Z = 0.01) and higher. For tau = 0.1, clumping occurs even at strongly sub-solar metallicities (Z greater or equal to 0.004), peaking at Z approximately 0.01 to 0.03, including solar values. Under these conditions, vortices weaken significantly and become more spatially extended. At higher metallicities (Z greater or equal to 0.04) with tau = 0.1, large-scale vortex formation is suppressed, leading to nearly axisymmetric dust rings, which can still undergo clumping via the classical Streaming Instability.

 - **Abstract**
 In 1962, Yoshihide Kozai reported his findings on the secular dynamics of asteroids moving in orbits with high inclination and eccentricity. In contrast to the classic understanding of the stability of planetary motion in the solar system, Kozai showed that asteroids can significantly change their orbital shape over a long timescale in an oscillatory manner between nearly circular orbits and highly elliptic orbits. An anti-correlated variation between orbital inclination and eccentricity characterizes this oscillation. The importance of Kozai's work in understanding the dynamical evolution of various systems was recognized decades later, including the fields of irregular satellites of planets, Oort Cloud, extrasolar planets, binary star systems, type Ia supernovae, planet climate, merging black hole systems, and so on.

 - **Abstract**
 This report presents the findings of a NIAC Phase I feasibility study for the Artemis-enabled Stellar Imager (AeSI), a proposed high-resolution, UV/Optical interferometer designed for deployment on the lunar surface. Its primary science goal is to image the surfaces and interiors of stars with unprecedented detail, revealing new details about their magnetic processes and dynamic evolution and enabling the creation of a truly predictive solar/stellar dynamo model. This capability will transform our understanding of stellar physics and has broad applicability across astrophysics, from resolving the cores of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) to studying supernovae, planetary nebulae, and the late stages of stellar evolution. By leveraging the stable vacuum environment of the Moon and the infrastructure being established for the Artemis Program, AeSI presents a compelling case for a lunar-based interferometer. In this study, the AeSI Team, working with the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Integrated Design Center (IDC), has firmly established the feasibility of building and operating a reconfigurable, dispersed aperture telescope (i.e., an interferometer) on the lunar surface. The collaboration produced a credible Baseline design featuring 15 primary mirrors arranged in an elliptical array with a 1 km major axis, with the potential to expand to 30 mirrors and larger array sizes through staged deployments. Additionally, this study identified numerous opportunities for optimization and the necessary trade studies to refine the design further. These will be pursued in follow-up investigations, such as a NIAC Phase II study, to advance the concept toward implementation.
#### Deuterated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in the Interstellar Medium: Constraints from the Orion Bar as Observed by the James Webb Space Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 The gas-phase abundances of deuterium (D) in the local interstellar medium (ISM) exhibit considerable regional variations. Particularly, in some regions the gas-phase D abundances are substantially lower than the primordial D abundance generated in the Big Bang, after subtracting the astration reduction caused by the Galactic chemical evolution. Deuterated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules have been suggested as a potential reservoir of the D atoms missing from the gas-phase. Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope's Near Infrared Spectrograph have revealed the widespread of deuterated PAHs in the Orion Bar through their aliphatic C--D emission at 4.65${\,{\rm \mu m}}$ and possibly aromatic C--D emission at 4.4${\,{\rm \mu m}}$ as well. To examine the viability of deuterated PAHs as the D reservoir, we model the infrared (IR) emission spectra of small PAH molecules containing various aromatic and aliphatic D atoms in the Orion Bar. We find that small deuterated PAHs exhibit a noticeable emission band at 4.4 or 4.65${\,{\rm \mu m}}$ even if they contain only one aromatic or aliphatic D atom. We derive ${N_{\rm D,ali}}/{N_{\rm H}}\approx3.4\%$, the deuteration degree of PAHs measured as the number of aliphatic D atoms (relative to H), from the observed intensity ratios of the 4.65${\,{\rm \mu m}}$ band to the 3.3${\,{\rm \mu m}}$ aromatic C--H band. The deuteration degree for aromatically-deuterated PAHs is less certain as C--N stretch also contributes to the observed emission around 4.4${\,{\rm \mu m}}$. If we attribute it exclusively to aromatic C--D, we derive an upper limit of $\approx14\%$ on the deuteration degree, which is capable of accounting for an appreciable fraction of the missing D budget.
#### $^{14}$N$/^{15}$N abundance ratio toward massive star-forming regions with different Galactic distances

 - **Abstract**
 The abundance ratio of $^{14}$N$/^{15}$N is, in principle, a powerful tool for tracing stellar nucleosynthesis. This work aims to measure and analyze ($^{14}$N/$^{15}$N)$\times$($^{13}$C/$^{12}$C) and $^{14}$N$/^{15}$N abundance ratios in massive star-forming regions across a range of galactocentric distances to provide constraints on galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models. We present H$^{13}$CN and HC$^{15}$N J=2-1 results toward 51massive star-forming regions obtained with the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimétrique (IRAM) 30 meter telescope.\ We used these results to derive ($^{14}$N/$^{15}$N)$\times$($^{13}$C/$^{12}$C) abundance ratios as well as $^{14}$N$/^{15}$N ratios using the double isotope method. We find an overall decreasing trend in the ($^{14}$N/$^{15}$N)$\times$($^{13}$C/$^{12}$C) abundance ratio and an increasing trend in the $^{14}$N$/^{15}$N ratio with increasing galactocentric distance ($D_{\rm GC}$), which provides a good constraint for the GCE model based on high signal to noise ratio measurements. While the predicted ($^{14}$N/$^{15}$N)$\times$($^{13}$C/$^{12}$C) ratios between 6 and 12 kpc determined using current GCE models are consistent with our observational results, the ratios from models for $D_{\rm GC}$ less than 6 kpc are significantly higher than the observational results, which indicates GCE models for $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N and/or $^{13}$C/$^{12}$C ratios need to be updated for at least this range.

 - **Abstract**
 There is evidence that stars and browns dwarfs grow through episodic rather than continuous gas accretion. However, the role of episodic accretion in the formation of brown dwarfs remains mostly unexplored. We investigate the role of episodic accretion, triggered by the magnetorotational instability in the inner disk regions, resulting in episodic outbursts during the formation of brown dwarfs, and its implications for their early formation stages. We use hydrodynamical simulations coupled with a sub-grid accretion model to investigate the formation of young proto-brown dwarfs and protostars, taking into account the effects of episodic accretion resulting in episodic radiative feedback, i.e. in luminosity outbursts. The formation timescale for proto brown dwarfs is at least one order of magnitude shorter than that of protostars. Episodic accretion leads to a shorter main accretion phase compared to continuous accretion in brown dwarfs, whereas the opposite is true for low-mass stars. Episodic accretion can accelerate early mass accretion in proto-brown dwarfs and protostars, but it results in less massive objects by the end of the main phase compared to continuous accretion. We find an approximately linear correlation between an object's mass at the end of the main accretion phase and the timing of the last episodic outburst: later events result in more massive brown dwarfs but less massive low-mass stars. Episodic outbursts have a stronger effect on brown dwarf-forming cloud cores, with the last outburst essentially splitting the brown dwarf evolution into a short high-accretion and a much longer low-accretion phase.
#### Forming Mercury by a grazing giant collision involving similar mass bodies

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of Mercury still remains poorly understood compared to the other rocky planets of the Solar System. One of the most relevant constraints that any formation model has to fulfill refers to its internal structure, with a predominant iron core covered by a thin silicate layer. This led to the idea that it could be the product of a mantle stripping caused by a giant impact. Previous studies in this line focused on binary collisions involving bodies of very different masses. However, such collisions are actually rare in N-body simulations of terrestrial planet formation, whereas collisions involving similar mass bodies appear to be more frequent. Here, we perform smooth particle hydrodynamics simulations to investigate the conditions under which collisions of similar mass bodies are able to form a Mercury-like planet. Our results show that such collisions can fulfill the necessary constraints in terms of mass (0.055 $M_\oplus$) and composition (30/70 silicate-to-iron mass ratio) within less than 5%, as long as the impact angles and velocities are properly adjusted according to well established scaling laws.
