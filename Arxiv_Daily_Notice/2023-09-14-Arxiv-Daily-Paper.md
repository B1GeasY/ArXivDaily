#### Spectroscopic analysis of hot, massive stars in large spectroscopic  surveys with de-idealised models
 - **Authors:** J. M. Bestenlehner, T. Enßlin, M. Bergemann, P. A. Crowther, M. Greiner, M. Selig

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming large-scale spectroscopic surveys with e.g. WEAVE and 4MOST will provide thousands of spectra of massive stars, which need to be analysed in an efficient and homogeneous way. Usually, studies of massive stars are limited to samples of a few hundred objects which pushes current spectroscopic analysis tools to their limits because visual inspection is necessary to verify the spectroscopic fit. Often uncertainties are only estimated rather than derived and prior information cannot be incorporated without a Bayesian approach. In addition, uncertainties of stellar atmospheres and radiative transfer codes are not considered as a result of simplified, inaccurate or incomplete/missing physics or, in short, idealised physical models. Here, we address the question of "How to compare an idealised model of complex objects to real data?" with an empirical Bayesian approach and maximum a {\it posterior} approximations. We focus on application to large scale optical spectroscopic studies of complex astrophysical objects like stars. More specifically, we test and verify our methodology on samples of OB stars in 30 Doradus region of the Large Magellanic Clouds using a grid of FASTWIND model atmospheres. Our spectroscopic model de-idealisation analysis pipeline takes advantage of the statistics that large samples provide by determining the model error to account for the idealised stellar atmosphere models, which are included into the error budget. The pipeline performs well over a wide parameter space and derives robust stellar parameters with representative uncertainties.
#### CoReCon: an open, community-powered collection of Reionization  constraints
 - **Authors:** Enrico Garaldi

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06480
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06480
 - **Abstract**
 The number of available constraints on the Universe during and before cosmic reionization is rapidly growing. These are often scattered across inhomogeneous formats, unit systems and sampling strategies. In this paper, I introduce CoReCon, a Python package designed to provide a growing set of constraints on key physical quantities related to the Epoch of Reionization and a platform for the high-redshift research community to collect and store, in an open way, current and forthcoming observational constraints.
#### Understanding Molecular Abundances in Star-Forming Regions Using  Interpretable Machine Learning

 - **Abstract**
 Astrochemical modelling of the interstellar medium typically makes use of complex computational codes with parameters whose values can be varied. It is not always clear what the exact nature of the relationship is between these input parameters and the output molecular abundances. In this work, a feature importance analysis is conducted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), an interpretable machine learning technique, to identify the most important physical parameters as well as their relationship with each output. The outputs are the abundances of species and ratios of abundances. In order to reduce the time taken for this process, a neural network emulator is trained to model each species' output abundance and this emulator is used to perform the interpretable machine learning. SHAP is then used to further explore the relationship between the physical features and the abundances for the various species and ratios we considered. \ce{H2O} and CO's gas phase abundances are found to strongly depend on the metallicity. \ce{NH3} has a strong temperature dependence, with there being two temperature regimes (< 100 K and > 100K). By analysing the chemical network, we relate this to the chemical reactions in our network and find the increased temperature results in increased efficiency of destruction pathways. We investigate the HCN/HNC ratio and show that it can be used as a cosmic thermometer, agreeing with the literature. This ratio is also found to be correlated with the metallicity. The HCN/CS ratio serves as a density tracer, but also has three separate temperature-dependence regimes, which are linked to the chemistry of the two molecules.
#### A Strong Blend in the Morning: Studying the Circumgalactic Medium Before  Cosmic Noon with Strong, Blended Lyman-$α$ Forest Systems
 - **Authors:** Sean Morrison, Debopam Som, Matthew M. Pieri, Ignasi Pérez-Ràfols, Michael Blomqvist
 - **Subjects:** Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06813
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06813
 - **Abstract**
 We study of the properties of a new class of circumgalactic medium absorbers identified in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest: "Strong, Blended Lyman-$\alpha$" (or SBLA) absorption systems. We study SBLAs at $2.4<z<3.1$ in SDSS-IV/eBOSS spectra by their strong extended Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption complexes covering 138 km/s with an integrated $\log (N_{HI}/$cm$^{-2}) =16.04^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$ and Doppler parameter $b=18.1^{+0.7}_{-0.4}$ km/s. Clustering with the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest provides a large-scale structure bias of $b = 2.34\pm0.06$ and halo mass estimate of $M_h \approx 10^{12}{\rm h^{-1}M_{sol}}$ for our SBLA sample. We measure the ensemble mean column densities of 22 metal features in the SBLA composite spectrum and find that no single-population multiphase model for them is viable. We therefore explore the underlying SBLA population by forward modelling the SBLA absorption distribution. Based on covariance measurements and favoured populations we find that $\approx 25$% of our SBLAs have stronger metals. Using silicon only we find that our strong metal SBLAs trace gas with a $\log(n_H / $cm$^{-3}) > -2.45$ for $T=10^{3.5}$K and show gas clumping on $<255$ parsec scales. We fit multiphase models to this strong sub-population and find a low ionization phase with $n_H=1$cm$^{-3}$, $T=10^{3.5}$K and $[X/H]=0.8$, an intermediate ionization phase with $\log(n_H / $cm$^{-3}) = -3.35$, $T=10^{3.5}$K and $[X/H]=-1.1$, and a poorly constrained higher ionization phase. We find that the low ionization phase traces cold, dense super-solar metallicity gas with a clumping scale of just 0.009 parsecs.
#### Discovery of a molecular cloud possibly associated with the youngest  Galactic SNR G1.9+0.3

 - **Abstract**
 The youngest known Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) G1.9+0.3 has high-velocity supernova shock beyond 10000 km s-1, and it is considered to be one of the major candidates of a PeVatron. Despite these outstanding properties, the surrounding interstellar matter of this object is poorly understood. We investigated the interstellar gas toward G1.9+0.3 using the 12CO(J=3-2) data with the angular resolution of 15" obtained by the CHIMPS2 survey by the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, and discovered three individual clouds at -1, 7, and 45 km s-1. From its morphological and velocity structures, the -1 km s-1 cloud, having the largest velocity width >20 km s-1 and located at the distance of the Galactic Center, is possibly associated with the SNR. The associated cloud shows a cavity structure both in space and velocity and coincides well with the SNR. We found that the associated cloud has higher column densities toward three bright, radio synchrotron-emitted rims where the radial expansion velocity of the supernova shock is decelerated, and the cloud is faint in the other parts of the SNR. This is the first direct evidence indicating that the highly anisotropic expansion of G1.9+0.3 observed by previous studies results from the deceleration by the interaction between the supernova shock and surrounding dense interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Wide binaries play a crucial role in analyzing the birth environment of stars and the dynamical evolution of clusters. When wide binaries are located at greater distances, their companions may overlap in the observed images, becoming indistinguishable and resulting in unresolved wide binaries, which are difficult to detect using traditional methods. Utilizing deep learning, we present a method to identify unresolved wide binaries by analyzing the point-spread function (PSF) morphology of telescopes. Our trained model demonstrates exceptional performance in differentiating between single stars and unresolved binaries with separations ranging from 0.1 to 2 physical pixels, where the PSF FWHM is ~2 pixels, achieving an accuracy of 97.2% for simulated data from the Chinese Space Station Telescope. We subsequently tested our method on photometric data of NGC 6121 observed by the Hubble Space Telescope. The trained model attained an accuracy of 96.5% and identified 18 wide binary candidates with separations between 7 and 140 au. The majority of these wide binary candidates are situated outside the core radius of NGC 6121, suggesting that they are likely first-generation stars, which is in general agreement with the results of Monte Carlo simulations. Our PSF-based method shows great promise in detecting unresolved wide binaries and is well suited for observations from space-based telescopes with stable PSF. In the future, we aim to apply our PSF-based method to next-generation surveys such as the China Space Station Optical Survey, where a larger-field-of-view telescope will be capable of identifying a greater number of such wide binaries.
#### Science opportunities for IMAP-Lo observations of ISN He, Ne and O

 - **Abstract**
 Direct-sampling observations of interstellar neutral (ISN) species and their secondary populations inform on the physical state of the local interstellar medium and processes operating in the outer heliosheath. Such observations are performed from Earth's orbit by the IBEX-Lo experiment on board the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) mission. IBEX ISN viewing is restricted to directions close to perpendicular to the Earth-Sun line, which limits the observations of interstellar species to several months during the year. A greatly improved data set will be possible for the upcoming IMAP mission due to a novel concept of putting the IMAP-Lo detector on a pivot platform that varies the angle of observation relative to the Sun-Earth line and the detector boresight, as planned for the IMAP-Lo instrument on the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) mission (McComas et al. 2018). Here we suggest a 2 year scenario for varying the viewing angle in such a way that all the necessary atom components can be observed sufficiently well to achieve the science goals of nominal IMAP mission. This scenario facilitates, among others, removal of the correlation of the inflow parameters of interstellar gas, unambiguous analysis of the primary and secondary populations of interstellar He, Ne and O, and determination of the ionization rates of He and Ne free of possible calibration bias. The scheme is operationally simple, provides a good counting statistics, and synergizes observations of interstellar species and heliospheric energetic neutral atoms.
#### When and how does ram pressure stripping in low-mass satellite galaxies  enhance star formation
 - **Authors:** Jingyao Zhu, Stephanie Tonnesen, Greg L Bryan

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07037
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07037
 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how a satellite's star formation rate (SFR) and surviving gas respond to ram pressure stripping in various environments. Using a suite of high-resolution "wind-tunnel" simulations with radiative cooling, star formation, and supernovae feedback, we model the first infall orbit of a low-mass disk galaxy ($M_{*} = 10^{9.7} M_{\odot}$) in different host halos, ranging from Milky Way-like to cluster hosts. When the ram pressure is moderate, we find that the stripping satellite shows an enhanced SFR relative to the isolated control case, despite gas loss due to stripping. The SFR enhancement is caused, not directly by compression, but by ram pressure-driven mass flows, which can increase the dense gas fraction in the central disk regions. The spatially-resolved star formation main sequence and Kennicutt-Schmidt relations in our simulations are consistent with recent findings of the VERTICO and GASP surveys. Our results predict the environmental signals of RPS in future multiwavelength, high-angular resolution observations: the star formation and gas surface densities will be centralized, and symmetrically enhanced within the stripping radius.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Keck Infrared Transient Survey (KITS), a NASA Key Strategic Mission Support program to obtain near-infrared (NIR) spectra of astrophysical transients of all types, and its first data release, consisting of 105 NIR spectra of 50 transients. Such a data set is essential as we enter a new era of IR astronomy with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman). NIR spectral templates will be essential to search JWST images for stellar explosions of the first stars and to plan an effective Roma} SN Ia cosmology survey, both key science objectives for mission success. Between 2022 February and 2023 July, we systematically obtained 274 NIR spectra of 146 astronomical transients, representing a significant increase in the number of available NIR spectra in the literature. The first data release includes data from the 2022A semester. We systematically observed three samples: a flux-limited sample that includes all transients $<$17 mag in a red optical band (usually ZTF r or ATLAS o bands); a volume-limited sample including all transients within redshift $z < 0.01$ ($D \approx 50$ Mpc); and an SN Ia sample targeting objects at phases and light-curve parameters that had scant existing NIR data in the literature. The flux-limited sample is 39% complete (60% excluding SNe Ia), while the volume-limited sample is 54% complete and is 79% complete to $z = 0.005$. All completeness numbers will rise with the inclusion of data from other telescopes in future data releases. Transient classes observed include common Type Ia and core-collapse supernovae, tidal disruption events (TDEs), luminous red novae, and the newly categorized hydrogen-free/helium-poor interacting Type Icn supernovae. We describe our observing procedures and data reduction using Pypeit, which requires minimal human interaction to ensure reproducibility.
