 - **Abstract**
 A pulsar's pulse profile gets broadened at low frequencies due to dispersion along the line of sight or due to multi-path propagation. The dynamic nature of the interstellar medium makes both of these effects time-dependent and introduces slowly varying time delays in the measured times-of-arrival similar to those introduced by passing gravitational waves. In this article, we present a new method to correct for such delays by obtaining unbiased dispersion measure (DM) measurements by using low-frequency estimates of the scattering parameters. We evaluate this method by comparing the obtained DM estimates with those, where scatter-broadening is ignored using simulated data. A bias is seen in the estimated DMs for simulated data with pulse-broadening with a larger variability for a data set with a variable frequency scaling index, $\alpha$, as compared to that assuming a Kolmogorov turbulence. Application of the proposed method removes this bias robustly for data with band averaged signal-to-noise ratio larger than 100. We report, for the first time, the measurements of the scatter-broadening time and $\alpha$ from analysis of PSR J1643$-$1224, observed with upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope as part of the Indian Pulsar Timing Array experiment. These scattering parameters were found to vary with epoch and $\alpha$ was different from that expected for Kolmogorov turbulence. Finally, we present the DM time-series after application of the new technique to PSR J1643$-$1224.

 - **Abstract**
 ASASSN-21qj is a distant Sun-like star that recently began an episode of deep dimming events after no prior recorded variability. Here we examine archival and newly obtained optical and near-infrared data of this star. The deep aperiodic dimming and absence of previous infrared excess are reminiscent of KIC 8462852 (``Boyajian's Star''). The observed occultations are consistent with a circumstellar cloud of sub-micron-sized dust grains composed of amorphous pyroxene, with a minimum mass of $1.50~\pm~0.04\times10^{-9}~M_{\oplus}$ derived from the deepest occultations, and a minimum grain size of $0.29^{+0.01}_{-0.18}~\mu$m assuming a power law size distribution. We further identify the first evidence of near-infrared excess in this system from NEOWISE 3.4 and 4.6~$\mu$m observations. The excess emission implies a total circumstellar dust mass of around $10^{-6} M_{\oplus}$, comparable to the extreme, variable discs associated with terrestrial planet formation around young stars. The quasiperiodic recurrence of deep dips and the inferred dust temperature (ranging from 1800 to 700~K across the span of observations) independently point to an orbital distance of $\simeq$0.2~au for the dust, supporting the occulting material and excess emission being causally linked. The origin of this extended, opaque cloud is surmised to be the breakup of one or more exocometary bodies.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of OH$^+$ are used to infer the interstellar cosmic ray ionization rate in diffuse atomic clouds, thereby constraining the propagation of cosmic rays through and the shielding by interstellar clouds, as well as the low energy cosmic ray spectrum. In regions where the H$_2$ to H number density ratio is low, dissociative recombination (DR) is the dominant destruction process for OH$^+$ and the DR rate coefficient is important for predicting the OH$^+$ abundance and inferring the cosmic ray ionization rate. We have experimentally studied DR of electronically and vibrationally relaxed OH$^+$ in its lowest rotational levels, using an electron--ion merged-beams setup at the Cryogenic Storage Ring. From these measurements, we have derived a kinetic temperature rate coefficient applicable to diffuse cloud chemical models, i.e., for OH$^+$ in its electronic, vibrational, and rotational ground level. At typical diffuse cloud temperatures, our kinetic temperature rate coefficient is a factor of $\sim 5$ times larger than the previous experimentally derived value and a factor of $\sim 33$ times larger than the value calculated by theory. Our combined experimental and modelling results point to a significant increase for the cosmic ray ionization rate inferred from observations of OH$^+$ and H$_2$O$^+$, corresponding to a geometric mean of $(6.6 \pm 1.0) \times 10^{-16}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which is more than a factor of two larger than the previously inferred values of the cosmic ray ionization rate in diffuse atomic clouds. Combined with observations of diffuse and dense molecular clouds, these findings indicate a greater degree of cosmic ray shielding in interstellar clouds than has been previously inferred.

 - **Abstract**
 The survival time of a star cluster depends on its total mass, density, and thus size, as well as on the environment in which it was born and in which lies. Its dynamical evolution is influenced by various factors such as gravitational effects of the Galactic bar, spiral structures, and molecular clouds. Overall, the factors that determine the longevity of a cluster are complex and not fully understood. This study aims to investigate if open clusters and field stars respond differently to the perturbations that cause radial migration. In particular, we aim at understanding the nature of the oldest surviving clusters. We compared the time evolution of the kinematic properties of two Gaia DR3 samples: the first sample is composed of $\sim$40 open clusters and the second one of $\sim$66,000 MSTO field stars. Both selected samples are composed of stars selected with the same quality criterion, belonging to the thin disc, in a similar metallicity range, located in the same Galactocentric region [7.5-9 kpc] and with ages >1 Gyr. We performed a statistical analysis comparing the properties of the samples of field stars and of open clusters. A qualitative comparison of kinematic and orbital properties reveals that clusters younger than 2-3 Gyr are more resistant to perturbations than field stars and they move along quasi-circular orbits. Conversely, clusters older than approximately 3 Gyr have more eccentric and inclined orbits than isolated stars in the same age range. Such orbits lead them to reach higher elevations on the Galactic plane, maximising their probability to survive several Gyr longer. A formal statistical analysis reveals that there are differences among the time evolution of most of the kinematic and orbital properties of field stars and open clusters. Our results suggest that oldest survived clusters are usually more massive and move on orbits with higher eccentricity.

 - **Abstract**
 Isobutene ((CH$_3$)$_2$C=CH$_2$) is one of the four isomers of butene (C$_4$H$_8$). Given the detection of propene (CH$_3$CH=CH$_2$) toward TMC-1, and also in the warmer environment of the solar-type protostellar system IRAS 16293$-$2422, one of the next alkenes, isobutene, is a promising candidate to be searched for in space. We aim to extend the limited line lists of the main isotopologue of isobutene from the microwave to the millimetre region in order to obtain a highly precise set of rest frequencies and to facilitate its detection in the interstellar medium. We investigated the rotational spectrum of isobutene in the 35$-$370 GHz range using absorption spectroscopy at room temperature. Quantum-chemical calculations were carried out to evaluate vibrational frequencies. We determined new or improved spectroscopic parameters for isobutene up to a sixth-order distortion constant. These new results enabled its detection in the G+0.693 molecular cloud for the first time, where propene was also recently found. The propene to isobutene column density ratio was determined to be about 3:1. The observed spectroscopic parameters for isobutene are sufficiently accurate that calculated transition frequencies should be reliable up to 700 GHz. This will further help in observing this alkene in other, warmer regions of the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroseismology is a powerful tool that may be applied to shed light on stellar interiors and stellar evolution. Mixed modes, behaving as acoustic waves in the envelope and buoyancy modes in the core, are remarkable because they allow for probing the radiative cores and evanescent zones of red-giant stars. Here, we have developed a neural network that can accurately infer the coupling strength, a parameter related to the size of the evanescent zone, of solar-like stars in $\sim$5 milliseconds. In comparison with existing methods, we found that only $\sim$43\% inferences were in agreement to within a difference of 0.03 on a sample of $\sim$1,700 \textit{Kepler} red giants. To understand the origin of these differences, we analyzed a few of these stars using independent techniques such as the Monte Carlo Markov Chain method and Echelle diagrams. Through our analysis, we discovered that these alternate techniques are supportive of the neural-net inferences. We also demonstrate that the network can be used to yield estimates of coupling strength and large period separation in stars with structural discontinuities. Our findings suggest that the rate of decline in the coupling strength in the red-giant branch is greater than previously believed. These results are in closer agreement with calculations of stellar-evolution models than prior estimates, further underscoring the remarkable success of stellar-evolution theory and computation. Additionally, we show that the uncertainty in measuring large-period separation increases rapidly with diminishing coupling strength.
