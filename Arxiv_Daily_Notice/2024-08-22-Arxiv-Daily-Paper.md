 - **Abstract**
 Precise masses of red-giant stars enable a robust inference of their ages, but there are cases where these age estimates are highly precise yet very inaccurate. Examples are core-helium-burning (CHeB) stars that have lost more mass than predicted by standard single-star evolutionary models. Members of star clusters in the ${\it Kepler}$ database represent a unique opportunity to identify such stars, because they combine exquisite asteroseismic constraints with independent age information. In this work we focus on the single, metal-rich, Li-rich, low-mass, CHeB star KIC4937011, which is a member of the open cluster NGC 6819 (turn-off mass of $\approx 1.6 \, M_\odot$, i.e. age of $\approx 2.4$ Gyr). This star has $\approx 1 \, M_\odot$ less mass than expected for its age and metallicity, which could be explained by binary interactions or mass-loss along the red-giant branch (RGB). To infer formation scenarios for this object, we perform a Bayesian analysis by combining the binary stellar evolutionary framework $\texttt{binary_c v2.2.3}$ with the dynamic nested sampling approach contained in the $\texttt{dynesty v2.1.1}$ package. We find that this star is likely the result of a common-envelope evolution (CEE) phase during the RGB stage of the primary star in which the low-mass ($<0.71 \, M_\odot$) main sequence companion does not survive. During the CEE phase $\approx 1 \, M_\odot$ of material is ejected from the system, and the final star reaches the CHeB stage after helium flashes as if it were a single star of mass $\approx 0.7 \, M_\odot$, which is what we observe today. Although the proposed scenario is consistent with photometric and spectroscopic observations, a quantitative comparison with detailed stellar evolution calculations is needed to quantify the systematic skewness of radius, luminosity, and effective temperature distributions towards higher values than observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Photometric methods for identifying dark companion binaries - binary systems hosting quiescent black holes and neutron stars - operate by detecting ellipsoidal variations caused by tidal interactions. The limitation of this approach is that contact and semidetached binaries can produce similarly looking light curves. In this work, we address the degeneracy of ellipsoidal light curves by studying the differences between synthetically generated light curves of dark companion, semidetached, and contact binary systems. We inject the light curves with various levels of uncorrelated and correlated Gaussian noise to simulate the effects of instrumental noise and stellar spots. Using principal component analysis (PCA) and Fourier decomposition, we construct low-dimensional representations of the light curves. We find that the first two to five PCA components are sufficient to explain $99\%$ of variance in the data. The PCA representations are generally more informative than the Fourier representation for the same number of coefficients as measured by both the silhouette scores of the representations and the macro recalls of random forest classifiers trained on the representations. The random forest classifiers reach macro recalls from $0.97$ to $0.70$, indicating that the classes remain largely separable even under adverse conditions. We find that instrumental noise significantly impacts the class separation only when its standard deviation exceeds $10^{-3}$ mag, whereas the presence of spots can markedly reduce the class separation even when they contribute as little as $1\%$ of the light curve amplitude. We discuss the application of our method to real ellipsoidal samples, and we show that we can increase the purity of a sample of dark companion candidates by a factor of up to $27$ if we assume a prior purity of $1\%$, significantly improving the cost-efficiency of follow-up observations.
#### The densities in diffuse and translucent molecular clouds: estimates from observations of C$_2$ and from 3-dimensional extinction maps

 - **Abstract**
 Newly-computed collisional rate coefficients for the excitation of C$_2$ in collisions with H$_2$, presented recently by Najar and Kalugina (2020), are significantly larger than the values adopted previously in models for the excitation of the C$_2$ molecule, a widely used probe of the interstellar gas density. With these new rate coefficients, we have modeled the C$_2$ rotational distributions inferred from visible and ultraviolet absorption observations of electronic transitions of C$_2$ towards a collection of 46 nearby background sources. The inferred gas densities in the foreground interstellar clouds responsible for the observed C$_2$ absorption are a factor 4 to 7 smaller than those inferred previously, a direct reflection of the larger collisional rate coefficients computed by Najar and Kalugina (2020). These lower density estimates are generally in good agreement with the peak densities inferred from 3D extinction maps for the relevant sightlines. In cases where H$_3^+$ absorption has also been observed and used to estimate the cosmic-ray ionization rate (CRIR), our estimates of the latter will also decrease accordingly because the H$_3^+$ abundance is a function of the ratio of the CRIR to the gas density.
#### First joint MUSE, HST, and JWST spectro-photometric analysis of the intracluster light: the case of the relaxed cluster RX J2129.7+0005

 - **Abstract**
 We present the most detailed spectrum of the intracluster light (ICL) in an individual cluster to date, the relaxed system RX J2129.7+0005, at $z\sim 0.234$. Using 15 broad-band, deep images observed with HST and JWST in the optical and the infrared, plus deep integral field spectroscopy from MUSE, we computed a total of 3696 ICL maps spanning the spectral range $\sim 0.4-5$ $\mu$m with our algorithm CICLE, a method that is extremely well suited to analyzing large samples of data in a fully automated way. We used both parametric and non-parametric approaches to fit the spectral energy distribution of the ICL and infer its physical properties, yielding a stellar mass $log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})$ between $11.5-12.7$ and an average age between $9.7-10.5$ Gyr, from CIGALE and Prospector results. This implies that the ICL in RX J2129.7+0005 is, on average, older than that of disturbed clusters, suggesting that the contribution from different stellar populations to the ICL are at play depending on the cluster's dynamical state. Coupled with X-ray observations of the hot gas distribution, we confirm the relaxed state of RX J2129.7+0005, showing clear signs of sloshing after a last major merger with a high-mass ratio satellite that could have happened $\sim 6.6$ Gyr ago in a relatively radial orbit. The presence of substructure in the ICL, such as shells, clouds with different densities and a certain degree of boxyness, and a clump, supports this scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs) are evolved massive stars in the brief stage before they undergo core collapse. Not only are they rare, but they also can be particularly difficult to find due to the high extinction in the Galactic plane. This paper discusses the discovery of three new Galactic WRs previously classified as H$\alpha$ emission stars, but thanks to Gaia spectra, we were able to identify the broad, strong emission lines that characterize WRs. Using the Lowell Discovery Telescope and the DeVeny spectrograph, we obtained spectra for each star. Two are WC9s, and the third is a WN6 + O6.5 V binary. The latter is a known eclipsing system with a 4.4 day period from ASAS-SN data. We calculate absolute visual magnitudes for all three stars to be between -7 and -6, which is consistent with our expectations of these subtypes. These discoveries highlight the incompleteness of the WR census in our local volume of the Milky Way and suggest the potential for future Galactic WR discoveries from Gaia low-dispersion spectra. Furthermore, radial velocity studies of the newly found binary will provide direct mass estimates and orbital parameters, adding to our knowledge of the role that binarity plays in massive star evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Aerosol opacity has emerged as a critical factor controlling transmission and emission spectra. We provide a simple guideline for the effects of aerosol morphology on opacity and residence time in the atmosphere, as it pertains to transit observations, particularly those with flat spectra due to high altitude aerosols. This framework can be used for understanding complex cloud and haze particle properties before getting into detailed microphysical modeling. We consider high altitude aerosols to be composed of large fluffy particles that can have large residence times in the atmosphere and influence the deposition of stellar flux and/or the emergence of thermal emission in a different way than compact droplet particles, as generally modeled to date for extrasolar planetary atmospheres. We demonstrate the important influence of aggregate particle porosity and composition on the extent of the wavelength independent regime. We also consider how such fluffy particles reach such high altitudes and conclude that the most likely scenario is their local production at high altitudes via UV bombardment and subsequent blanketing of the atmosphere, rather than some mechanism of lofting or transport from the lower atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the consequences of non-ideal chemical interaction between silicate and overlying hydrogen-rich envelopes for rocky planets using basic tenets of phase equilibria. Based on our current understanding of the temperature and pressure conditions for complete miscibility of silicate and hydrogen, we find that the silicate-hydrogen binary solvus will dictate the nature of atmospheres and internal layering in rocky planets that garnered H$_2$-rich primary atmospheres. The temperatures at the surfaces of supercritical magma oceans will correspond to the silicate-hydrogen solvus. As a result, the radial positions of supercritical magma ocean-atmosphere interfaces, rather than their temperatures and pressures, should reflect the thermal states of these planets. The conditions prescribed by the solvus influence the structure of the atmosphere, and thus the transit radii of sub-Neptunes. Separation of iron-rich metal to form metal cores in sub-Neptunes and super-Earths is not assured due to prospects for neutral buoyancy of metal in silicate melt induced by dissolution of H, Si, and O in the metal at high temperatures.

 - **Abstract**
 All current estimates of the cosmic-ray (CR) ionization rate rely on assessments of the gas density along the probed sight lines. Until now, these have been based on observations of different tracers, with C$_2$ being the most widely used in diffuse molecular clouds for this purpose. However, three-dimensional dust extinction maps have recently reached sufficient accuracy as to give an independent measurement of the gas density on parsec scales. In addition, they allow us to identify the gas clumps along each sight line, thus localizing the regions where CR ionization is probed. We re-evaluate H$_3^+$ observations, which are often considered as the most reliable method to measure the H$_2$ ionization rate $\zeta_{\rm H_2}$ in diffuse clouds. The peak density values derived from the extinction maps for 12 analyzed sight lines turn out to be, on average, an order of magnitude lower than the previous estimates, and agree with the values obtained from revised analysis of C$_2$ data. We use the extinction maps in combination with the 3D-PDR code to self-consistently compute the H$_3^+$ and H$_2$ abundances in the identified clumps for different values of $\zeta_{\rm H_2}$. For each sight line, we obtain the optimum value by comparing the simulation results with observations. We show that $\zeta_{\rm H_2}$ is systematically reduced with respect to the earlier estimates by a factor of $\approx 9$ on average, to $\approx6\times10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$, primarily as a result of the density reduction. We emphasize that these results have profound consequences for all available measurements of the ionization rate.
#### CHIMPS2: $^{13}$CO $J = 3 \to 2$ emission in the Central Molecular Zone

 - **Abstract**
 We present the initial data for the ($J = 3 \to 2$) transition of $^{13}$CO obtained from the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way as part of the CO Heterodyne Inner Milky Way Plane Survey 2 (CHIMPS2). Covering $359^\circ \leq l \leq 1^\circ$ and $|b| \leq 0.5^\circ$ with an angular resolution of 19 arcsec, velocity resolution of 1 km s$^{-1}$, and rms $T_A^* = 0.59$ K at these resolutions, our observations unveil the complex structure of the CMZ molecular gas in improved detail. Complemented by the $^{12}$CO CHIMPS2 data, we estimate a median optical depth of $\tau_{13} = 0.087$. The preliminary analysis yields a median $^{13}$CO column density range equal to $N(^{13}\text{CO})= 2$--$5 \times 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$, median H$_2$ column density equal to $N(\text{H}_2)= 4 \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ to $1 \times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. We derive $N(\text{H}_2)$-based total mass estimates of $M(\text{H}_2)= 2$--$6 \times 10^7\, M_{\odot}$, in agreement with previous studies. We analyze the relationship between the integrated intensity of $^{13}$CO and the surface density of compact sources identified by Herschel Hi-GAL, and find that younger Hi-GAL sources detected at 500 $\mu$m but not at 70 $\mu$m follow the dense gas of the CMZ more closely than those that are bright at 70 $\mu$m. The latter, actively star-forming sources, appear to be more associated with material in the foreground spiral arms.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform new general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations for collapses of rotating supermassive star cores with an approximate nuclear burning up to carbon and a detailed equation of state. For all the models we investigate, the energy generation by nuclear burning plays only a minor role, leading to the formation of a black hole without a nuclear-powered explosion. For rotating models, however, the stellar explosion associated with shock heating is driven from a torus, which forms after the black hole formation. The explosion energy is up to $10^{-4}$ of the mass energy of the supermassive star cores ($\sim 10^{55}-10^{56}$ erg). We find that, even if we increase the rotational angular momentum of the progenitor, the ejecta mass saturates at $\sim 1$\% of the total mass of the initial stellar core. The average ejecta velocity also saturates at $\approx 20\%$ of the speed of light. As a result, the ejecta kinetic energy is approximately proportional to the initial mass of the supermassive star core for the rapidly rotating case. We also perform viscous hydrodynamics simulations for exploring the evolution of the remnant torus. Although the viscous heating drives an outflow from the torus, we find that its effect is subdominant in terms of the kinetic energy because of the small velocity ($\approx 0.07c$) of the ejecta component.

 - **Abstract**
 The dependence of the final fate of supermassive star (SMS) cores on their mass and angular momentum is studied with simple modeling. SMS cores in the hydrogen burning phase encounter the general relativistic instability during the stellar evolution if the mass is larger than $\sim 3 \times 10^4M_\odot$. Spherical SMS cores in the helium burning phase encounter the general relativistic instability prior to the onset of the electron-positron pair instability if the mass is larger than $\sim 1\times 10^4M_\odot$. For rapidly rotating SMS cores, these values for the threshold mass are enhanced by up to a factor of $\sim 5$, and thus, for SMSs with mass smaller than $\sim 10^4M_\odot$ the collapse is triggered by the pair-instability, irrespective of the rotation. After the onset of the general relativistic instability, SMS cores in the hydrogen burning phase with reasonable metallicity are likely to collapse to a black hole irrespective of the degree of rotation, whereas the SMS cores in the helium burning phase could explode via nuclear burning with no black hole formation, as previous works demonstrate.
#### Survey of Complex Organic Molecules in Starless and Prestellar Cores in the Perseus Molecular Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 Cold ($\sim$10 K) and dense ($\sim$10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) cores of gas and dust within molecular clouds, known as starless and dynamically evolved prestellar cores, are the birthplaces of low-mass ($M$ $\leq$ few M$_\odot$) stars. As detections of interstellar complex organic molecules, or COMs, in starless cores has increased, abundance comparisons suggest that some COMs might be seeded early in the star formation process and inherited to later stages (i.e., protostellar disks and eventually comets). To date observations of COMs in starless cores have been limited, with most detections reported solely in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. It is therefore still a question whether different environments affect abundances. We have surveyed 35 starless and prestellar cores in the Perseus Molecular Cloud with the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) 12m telescope detecting both methanol, CH$_3$OH, and acetaldehyde, CH$_3$CHO, in 100% and 49% of the sample, respectively. In the sub-sample of 15 cores where CH$_3$CHO was detected at $>3\sigma$ ($\sim$18 mK) with the ARO 12m, follow-up observations with the Yebes 40m telescope were carried out. Detections of formic acid, $t$-HCOOH, ketene, H$_2$CCO, methyl cyanide, CH$_3$CN, vinyl cyanide, CH$_2$CHCN, methyl formate, HCOOCH$_3$, and dimethyl ether, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, are seen in at least $20\%$ of the cores. We discuss detection statistics, calculate column densities, and compare abundances across various stages of low-mass star formation. Our findings have more than doubled COM detection statistics in cold cores and show COMs are prevalent in the gas before star and planet formation in the Perseus Molecular Cloud.
#### Properties of intermediate- to high-mass stars in the young cluster M17 -- Characterizing the (pre-)zero-age main sequence

 - **Abstract**
 The outcome of the formation of massive stars is an important anchor point in their evolution. It provides insight into the physics of the assembly process, and sets the conditions for stellar evolution. We characterize a population of 18 highly reddened O4.5 to B9 stars in the very young massive star-forming region M17. Their properties allow us to identify the empirical location of the ZAMS, and rotation and mass-loss rate of stars there. We performed quantitative spectroscopic modeling of VLT/X-shooter spectra using NLTE atmosphere code Fastwind and fitting approach Kiwi-GA. The observed SEDs were used to determine the line-of-sight extinction. From a comparison of their positions in the HRD with MIST evolutionary tracks, we inferred the stellar masses and ages. We find an age of $0.4_{-0.2}^{+0.6}$ Myr for our sample, however we also identify a strong relation between the age and the mass of the stars. The extinction towards the sources ranges from $A_V = 3.6$ to 10.6. Stars more massive than 10 M$_{\odot}$ have reached the ZAMS. Their projected ZAMS spin rate distribution extends to 0.3 of the critical velocity; their mass-loss rates agree with those of other main-sequence OB stars. Stars with a mass in the range $3 < M/$M$_{\odot} < 7$ are still on the pre-main sequence (PMS). Evolving their $v \sin i$ to the ZAMS yields values up to $\sim 0.6 v_{\rm crit}$. For PMS stars without disks, we find tentative mass-loss rates up to $10^{-8.5}\,$M$_{\odot}$\,yr$^{-1}$. We constrain the empirical location of the ZAMS for massive ($10 < M/$M$_{\odot} < 50$) stars. The ZAMS rotation rates for intermediate-mass stars are twice as high as for massive stars, suggesting that the angular momentum gain processes differ between the two groups. The relation between the age and mass of the stars suggests a lag in the formation of more massive stars relative to lower mass stars.
#### Chemical models of interstellar glycine and adenine precursor aminoacetonitrile (NH2CH2CN)

 - **Abstract**
 Aminoacetonitrile (AAN), also known as glycinenitrile, has been suggested as a possible precursor of glycine and adenine in the interstellar medium. Here we present the chemical modeling of AAN and its isomers in hot cores using the three-phase chemical model NAUTILUS with the addition of over 300 chemical reactions of the three AAN isomers and related species. Our models predicted a peak gas phase abundance of AAN reaching the order of 10-8, which is consistent with observation towards Sgr B2(N). Regarding the reaction pathways of AAN and its isomers, we found that AAN is primarily formed via free radical reactions on grain surfaces during the early evolutionary stages. Subsequently, it is thermally desorbed into the gas phase as the temperature rises and is then destroyed by positive ions and radicals in gas phase. The isomers of AAN are formed through the hydrogenation reaction of CH3NCN on the grain surface and via electron recombination reactions of ion C2H5N2+ in gas phase. We speculate that there is a possibility for NCCN and AAN to react with each other, eventually leading to the formation of adenine in hot cores. However, further investigation is required to understand the efficiency of grain surfaces in adenine formation, through theoretical calculations or laboratory experiments in future research.
