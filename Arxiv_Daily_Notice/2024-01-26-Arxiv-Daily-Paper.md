 - **Abstract**
 Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) is increasingly studied as a potential solution to small-scale discrepancies between simulations of cold dark matter (CDM) and observations. We examine a physically motivated two-state SIDM model with both elastic and inelastic scatterings. In particular, endothermic, exothermic, and elastic scattering occur with equal probability at high relative velocities ($v_{\rm rel}\gtrsim400~{\rm km/s})$. In a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulation of Milky Way-size haloes, we vary the primordial state fractions to understand the impact of inelastic dark matter self-interactions on halo structure and evolution. In particular, we test how the initial conditions impact the present-day properties of dark matter haloes. Depending on the primordial state fraction, scattering reactions will be dominated by either exothermic or endothermic effects for high and low initial excited state fractions respectively. We find that increasing the initial excited fraction reduces the mass of the main halo, as well as the number of subhaloes on all mass scales. The main haloes are cored, with lower inner densities and higher outer densities compared with CDM. Additionally, we find that the shape of the main halo becomes more spherical the higher the initial excited state fraction is. Finally, we show that the number of satellites steadily decreases with initial excited state fraction across all satellite masses.

 - **Abstract**
 Some hydrogen-rich core-collapse supernovae (type IIP SNe) exhibit evidence for a sustained energy source powering their light curves, resulting in a brighter and/or longer-lasting hydrogen-recombination plateau phase. We present a semi-analytic SNIIP light curve model that accounts for the effects of an arbitrary internal heating source, considering as special cases $^{56}$Ni/$^{56}$Co decay, a central engine (millisecond magnetar or accreting compact object), and shock interaction with a dense circumstellar disk. While a sustained internal power source can boost the plateau luminosity commensurate with the magnitude of the power, the duration of the recombination plateau can typically be increased by at most a factor $\sim 2-3$ compared to the zero-heating case. For a given ejecta mass and initial kinetic energy, the longest plateau duration is achieved for a constant heating rate at the highest magnitude that does not appreciably accelerate the ejecta. This finding has implications for the minimum ejecta mass required to explain particularly long-lasting supernovae such as iPTF14hls, and for confidently identifying rare explosions of the most-massive hydrogen-rich (e.g. population III) stars. We present a number of analytic estimates which elucidate the key features of the detailed model.

 - **Abstract**
 Grain-grain collisions shape the 3-dimensional size and velocity distribution of the inner Zodiacal Cloud and the impact rates of dust on inner planets, yet they remain the least understood sink of zodiacal dust grains. For the first time, we combine the collisional grooming method combined with a dynamical meteoroid model of Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) that covers four orders of magnitude in particle diameter to investigate the consequences of grain-grain collisions in the inner Zodiacal Cloud. We compare this model to a suite of observational constraints from meteor radars, the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), mass fluxes at Earth, and inner solar probes, and use it to derive the population and collisional strength parameters for the JFC dust cloud. We derive a critical specific energy of $Q^*_D=5\times10^5 \pm 4\times10^5 R_\mathrm{met}^{-0.24}$ J kg$^{-1}$ for particles from Jupiter-family comet particles, making them 2-3 orders of magnitude more resistant to collisions than previously assumed. We find that the differential power law size index $-4.2\pm0.1$ for particles generated by JFCs provides a good match to observed data. Our model provides a good match to the mass production rates derived from the Parker Solar Probe observations and their scaling with the heliocentric distance. The higher resistance to collisions of dust particles might have strong implications to models of collisions in solar and exo-solar dust clouds. The migration via Poynting-Roberson drag might be more important for denser clouds, the mass production rates of astrophysical debris disks might be overestimated, and the mass of the source populations might be underestimated. Our models and code are freely available online.

 - **Abstract**
 Violent astrophysical events, including core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers, can result in rotating neutron stars with diverse degrees of differential rotation. Oscillation modes of these neutron stars could be excited and emit strong gravitational waves. Detecting these modes may provide information about neutron stars, including their structures and dynamics. Hence, dynamical simulations were employed to construct relations for quantifying the oscillation mode frequency in previous studies. Specifically, linear relations for the frequencies of fundamental $l=0$ quasi-radial mode $f_{F}$ and fundamental $l=2$ quadrupolar mode $f_{^2f}$ were constructed by simulations with the Cowling approximation. Nevertheless, these relations can overestimate $f_{F}$ and underestimate $f_{^2f}$ up to $\sim 30\%$. Furthermore, it has yet to be fully studied how the degree of differential rotation affects $f_{F}$ and $f_{^2f}$. Here, for the first time, we consider both various degrees of differential rotation $\tilde{A}$ and dynamical spacetime to construct linear relations for quantifying $f_{F}$ and $f_{^2f}$. Through 2D axisymmetric simulations, we first show that both $f_{F}$ and $f_{^2f}$ scale almost linearly with the stellar compactness $M/R$ for different values of $\tilde{A}$. We also observe the quasi-linear relations for both $f_{F}$ and $f_{^2f}$ with the kinetic-to-binding energy ratio $T/|W|$ for different $\tilde{A}$ values. Finally, we constructed linear fits that can quantify $f_{F}$ and $f_{^2f}$ by $T/|W|$. Consequently, this work presented universal relations for the fundamental modes of rotating neutron stars with differential rotations in dynamical spacetime.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot Jupiters exhibit large day-night temperature contrasts. Their cooler nightsides are thought to host clouds. However, the exact nature of these clouds, their spatial distribution, and their impact on atmospheric dynamics, thermal structure, and spectra is still unclear. We investigate the atmosphere of WASP-43 b, a short period hot Jupiter recently observed with JWST, to understand the radiative and dynamical impact of clouds on the atmospheric circulation and thermal structure. We aim to understand the impact of different kinds of condensates potentially forming in WASP-43 b, with various sizes and atmospheric metallicities. We used a 3D global climate model (GCM) with a new temperature-dependent cloud model that includes radiative feed-backs coupled with hydrodynamical integrations to study the atmospheric properties of WASP-43 b. We produced observables from our simulations and compared them to spectral phase curves from various observations. We show that clouds have a net warming effect, meaning that the greenhouse effect caused by clouds is stronger than the albedo cooling effect. We show that the radiative effect of clouds has various impacts on the dynamical and thermal structure of WASP-43 b. Depending on the type of condensates and their sizes, the radiative-dynamical feedback will modify the horizontal and vertical temperature gradient and reduce the wind speed. For super-solar metallicity atmospheres, fewer clouds form in the atmosphere, leading to a weaker feedback. Comparisons with spectral phase curves observed with HST, Spitzer, and JWST indicate that WASP-43 b s nightside is cloudy and rule out sub-micron Mg2SiO4 cloud particles as the main opacity source. Distinguishing between cloudy solar and cloudy super-solar-metallicity atmospheres is not straightforward, and further observations of both reflected light and thermal emission are needed.

 - **Abstract**
 A number of works infer radial temperature profiles of envelopes surrounding young stellar objects using several rotational transitions in a pixel-by-pixel or azimuthally-averaged basis. However, in many cases the assumption that the rotational temperature is constant along the line of sight is made, while this is not the case when a partially resolved envelope, assumed to be spherically symmetric, is used to obtain values of temperature for different projected radii. This kind of analysis (homogeneous analysis) is intrinsically inconsistent. By using a spherical envelope model to interpret NH3 (1, 1) and (2, 2) observations, we tested how robust it is to infer radial temperature profiles of an envelope. The temperature and density of the model envelope are power laws of radius, but the density can be flat for an inner central part. The homogeneous analysis was applied to obtain radial temperature profiles, and resulted that for small projected radii, where the optical depth of the lines is high, the homogeneous temperature can be much higher than the actual envelope temperature. In general, for larger projected radii, both the temperature and the temperature power-law index can be underestimated by as much as 40%, and 0.15, respectively. We applied this study to the infrared dark cloud G14.225-0.506 for which the radial temperature profile was previously derived from the dust emission at submillimeter wavelengths and the spectral energy distribution. As expected, the homogeneous analysis underestimated both the temperature and the temperature power-law index.

 - **Abstract**
 In June 2015, Cassini high-resolution images of Saturn's limb southwards of the planet's hexagonal wave revealed a system of at least six stacked haze layers above the upper cloud deck. Here, we characterize those haze layers and discuss their nature. Vertical thickness of layers ranged from 7 to 18 km, and they extended in altitude approx 130 km, from pressure level 0.5 bar to 0.01 bar. Above them, a thin but extended aerosol layer reached altitude approx 340 km (0.4 mbar). Radiative transfer modeling of spectral reflectivity shows that haze properties are consistent with particles of diameter 0.07- 1.4 \{mu}m and number density 100 - 500 cm -3. The nature of the hazes is compatible with their formation by condensation of hydrocarbon ices, including acetylene and benzene at higher altitudes. Their vertical distribution could be due to upward propagating gravity waves generated by dynamical forcing by the hexagon and its associated eastward jet.
#### Procoli: Profiles of cosmological likelihoods

 - **Abstract**
 Frequentist profile likelihoods have seen a resurgence in cosmology, offering an alternative to Bayesian methods as they can circumvent the impact of prior-volume effects. This paper presents Procoli, a fast and accessible package to obtain profile likelihoods in cosmology, available on GitHub and PyPI. Procoli seamlessly integrates with MontePython, incorporating all its available data likelihoods, as well as any modified versions of CLASS. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the Procoli code, detailing the simulated-annealing optimizer at its core and the sequential computation of the profile. An an example, we use the early dark energy model which is afflicted by prior-volume effects to illustrate the code's features. We validate its optimizer with mock data, and compare optimization techniques for both the global minimum and the profile. Procoli further enables splitting profiles into their component contributions from individual experiments, offering nuanced insights into the data and model. As a valuable addition to the cosmologist's toolkit, Procoli supplements existing Bayesian codes, contributing to more robust parameter constraints in cosmological studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The detection of NH2CH2CH2OH (ethanolamine) in molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027 adds an additional player to the prebiotic molecules discovered so far in the interstellar medium (ISM). As this molecule might be formed through condensed-phase hydrogenation steps, detecting one or more of the molecules involved might help to elucidate the chemical pathway leading to its production. Aims. The chemical path involves the formation of four chemical species. In this work, we study the energies of the isomers involved, indicate the best candidates for detection purposes, and provide the distortion constants of the most energetically favoured isomers undetected so far. Methods. We used highly accurate CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pCVTZ-F12 computations to predict the lowest energy isomers as well as their spectroscopic constants, taking corrections for core electron correlation and scalar relativity into account. Results. We studied 14 isomers. We find that the lowest energy isomer proposed in previous studies is not the actual minimum. We provide a set of rotational and distortion constants of the two new most stable isomers together with their fundamental vibrational frequencies in order to guide the search for these important astrochemical precursors of prebiotic molecules in the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 The production of heavy elements is one of the main by-products of the explosive end of massive stars. A long sought goal is finding differentiated patterns in the nucleosynthesis yields, which could permit identifying a number of properties of the explosive core. Among them, the traces of the magnetic field topology are particularly important for \emph{extreme} supernova explosions, most likely hosted by magnetorotational effects. We investigate the nucleosynthesis of five state-of-the-art magnetohydrodynamic models with fast rotation that have been previously calculated in full 3D and that involve an accurate neutrino transport (M1). One of the models does not contain any magnetic field and synthesizes elements around the iron group, in agreement with other CC-SNe models in literature. All other models host a strong magnetic field of the same intensity, but with different topology. For the first time, we investigate the nucleosynthesis of MR-SNe models with a quadrupolar magnetic field and a 90 degree tilted dipole. We obtain a large variety of ejecta compositions reaching from iron nuclei to nuclei up to the third r-process peak. We assess the robustness of our results by considering the impact of different nuclear physics uncertainties such as different nuclear masses, $\beta^{-}$-decays and $\beta^{-}$-delayed neutron emission probabilities, neutrino reactions, fission, and a feedback of nuclear energy on the temperature. We find that the qualitative results do not change with different nuclear physics input. The properties of the explosion dynamics and the magnetic field configuration are the dominant factors determining the ejecta composition.
