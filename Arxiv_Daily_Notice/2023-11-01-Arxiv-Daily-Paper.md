 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae (SNs) are one of the most powerful cosmic sources of neutrinos, with energies of several MeV. The emission of neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors carries away the gravitational binding energy of the compact remnant and drives its evolution from the hot initial to the cold final states. Detecting these neutrinos from Earth and analyzing the emitted signals present a unique opportunity to explore the neutrino mass ordering problem. This research outlines the detection of neutrinos from SNs and their relevance in understanding the neutrino mass ordering. The focus is on developing a model-independent analysis strategy, achieved by comparing distinct detection channels in large underground detectors. The objective is to identify potential indicators of mass ordering within the neutrino sector. Additionally, a thorough statistical analysis is performed on the anticipated neutrino signals for both mass orderings. Despite uncertainties in supernova explosion parameters, an exploration of the parameter space reveals an extensive array of models with significant sensitivity to differentiate between mass orderings. The assessment of various observables and their combinations underscores the potential of forthcoming supernova observations in addressing the neutrino mass ordering problem.

 - **Abstract**
 The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA), part of the Pierre Auger Observatory, is currently the largest array of radio antenna stations deployed for the detection of cosmic rays, spanning an area of $17$ km$^2$ with 153 radio stations. It detects the radio emission of extensive air showers produced by cosmic rays in the $30-80$ MHz band. Here, we report the AERA measurements of the depth of the shower maximum ($X_\text{max}$), a probe for mass composition, at cosmic-ray energies between $10^{17.5}$ to $10^{18.8}$ eV, which show agreement with earlier measurements with the fluorescence technique at the Pierre Auger Observatory. We show advancements in the method for radio $X_\text{max}$ reconstruction by comparison to dedicated sets of CORSIKA/CoREAS air-shower simulations, including steps of reconstruction-bias identification and correction, which is of particular importance for irregular or sparse radio arrays. Using the largest set of radio air-shower measurements to date, we show the radio $X_\text{max}$ resolution as a function of energy, reaching a resolution better than $15$ g cm$^{-2}$ at the highest energies, demonstrating that radio $X_\text{max}$ measurements are competitive with the established high-precision fluorescence technique. In addition, we developed a procedure for performing an extensive data-driven study of systematic uncertainties, including the effects of acceptance bias, reconstruction bias, and the investigation of possible residual biases. These results have been cross-checked with air showers measured independently with both the radio and fluorescence techniques, a setup unique to the Pierre Auger Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the evolution of heavy stars ($M\ge40{\rm M}_\odot$) undergoing pair-instability in the presence of annihilating dark matter. Focusing on the scenario where the dark matter is in capture-annihilation equilibrium, we model the profile of energy injections in the local thermal equilibrium approximation. We find that significant changes to masses of astrophysical black holes formed by (pulsational) pair-instability supernovae can occur when the ambient dark matter density $ \rho_{\rm DM} \gtrsim10^9 \rm \, GeV \, cm^{-3}$. There are two distinct outcomes, depending on the dark matter mass. For masses $m_{\rm DM}\gtrsim1$ GeV the DM is primarily confined to the core. The annihilation increases the lifetime of core helium burning, resulting in more oxygen being formed, fueling a more violent explosion during the pair-instability-induced contraction. This drives stronger pulsations, leading to lighter black holes being formed than predicted by the standard model. For masses $m_{\rm DM}\lesssim0.5$ GeV there is significant dark matter in the envelope, leading to a phase where the star is supported by the energy from the annihilation. This reduces the core temperature and density, allowing the star to evade the pair-instability allowing heavier black holes to be formed. We find a mass gap for all models studied.

 - **Abstract**
 Time dependent photoionization modeling of warm absorber outflows in active galactic nuclei can play an important role in understanding the interaction between warm absorbers and the central black hole. The warm absorber may be out of the equilibrium state because of the variable nature of the central continuum. In this paper, with the help of time dependent photoionization modeling, we study how the warm absorber gas changes with time and how it reacts to changing radiation fields. Incorporating a flaring incident light curve, we investigate the behavior of warm absorbers using a photoionization code that simultaneously and consistently solves the time dependent equations of level population, heating and cooling, and radiative transfer. We simulate the physical processes in the gas clouds, such as ionization, recombination, heating, cooling, and the transfer of ionizing radiation through the cloud. We show that time dependent radiative transfer is important and that calculations which omit this effect quantitatively and systematically underestimate the absorption. Such models provide crucial insights into the characteristics of warm absorbers and can constrain their density and spatial distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 The isotopic ratios are good tools for probing the stellar nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution. We performed high-sensitivity mapping observations of the J=7-6 rotational transitions of OCS, OC34S, O13CS, and OC33S toward the Galactic Center giant molecular cloud, Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2) with IRAM 30m telescope. Positions with optically thin and uncontaminated lines are chosen to determine the sulfur isotope ratios. A 32S/34S ratio of 17.1\pm0.9 was derived with OCS and OC34S lines, while 34S/33S ratio of 6.8\pm1.9 was derived directly from integrated intensity ratio of OC34S and OC33S. With independent and accurate measurements of 32S/34S ratio, our results confirm the termination of the decreasing trend of 32S/34S ratios toward the Galactic Center, suggesting a drop in the production of massive stars at the Galactic centre.
#### How do baryonic effects on the cosmic matter distribution vary with  scale and local density environment?

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.20278
 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate how the baryonic effects vary with scale and local density environment mainly by utilizing a novel statistic, the environment-dependent wavelet power spectrum (env-WPS). With four state-of-the-art cosmological simulation suites, EAGLE, SIMBA, Illustris, and IllustrisTNG, we compare the env-WPS of the total matter density field between the hydrodynamic and dark matter-only (DMO) runs at $z=0$. We find that the clustering is most strongly suppressed in the emptiest environment of $\rho_\mathrm{m}/\bar\rho_\mathrm{m}<0.1$ with maximum amplitudes $\sim67-89$ per cent on scales $\sim1.86-10.96\ h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and less suppressed in higher density environments on small scales (except Illustris). In the environments of $\rho_\mathrm{m}/\bar\rho_\mathrm{m}\geqslant0.316$ ($\geqslant10$ in EAGLE), the feedbacks also lead to enhancement features at intermediate and large scales, which is most pronounced in the densest environment of $\rho_\mathrm{m}/\bar\rho_\mathrm{m}\geqslant100$ and reaches a maximum $\sim 7-15$ per cent on scales $\sim0.87-2.62\ h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ (except Illustris). The baryon fraction of the local environment decreases with increasing density, denoting the feedback strength, and potentially explaining some differences between simulations. We also measure the volume and mass fractions of local environments, which are affected by $\gtrsim 1$ per cent due to baryon physics. In conclusion, our results reveal that the baryonic processes can change the overall cosmic structure greatly over the scales of $k>0.1\ h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. These findings warrant further investigation and confirmation by using much larger or more numerous simulations, comparing different cosmic structure classifications, or altering a specific process in the simulation, e.g. the star formation, black hole accretion, stellar feedback or active galactic nucleus feedback.
#### Galactic `Snake' IRDC G11.11$-$0.12: a site of multiple hub-filament  systems and colliding filamentary clouds

 - **Abstract**
 To probe star formation processes, we present a multi-scale and multi-wavelength investigation of the `Snake' nebula/infrared dark cloud G11.11$-$0.12 (hereafter, G11; length $\sim$27 pc). Spitzer images hint at the presence of sub-filaments (in absorption), and reveal four infrared-dark hub-filament system (HFS) candidates (extent $<$ 6 pc) toward G11, where massive clumps ($>$ 500 $M_{\odot}$) and protostars are identified. The $^{13}$CO(2-1), C$^{18}$O(2-1), and NH$_{3}$(1,1) line data reveal a noticeable velocity oscillation toward G11, as well as its left part (or part-A) around V$_{lsr}$ of 31.5 km s$^{-1}$, and its right part (or part-B) around V$_{lsr}$ of 29.5 km s$^{-1}$. The common zone of these cloud components is investigated toward the center's G11 housing one HFS. Each cloud component hosts two sub-filaments. In comparison to part-A, more ATLASGAL clumps are observed toward part-B. The JWST near-infrared images discover one infrared-dark HFS candidate (extent $\sim$0.55 pc) around the massive protostar G11P1 (i.e., G11P1-HFS). Hence, the infrared observations reveal multiple infrared-dark HFS candidates at multi-scale in G11. The ALMA 1.16 mm continuum map shows multiple finger-like features (extent $\sim$3500-10000 AU) surrounding a dusty envelope-like feature (extent $\sim$18000 AU) toward the central hub of G11P1-HFS. Signatures of forming massive stars are found toward the center of the envelope-like feature. The ALMA H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ line data show two cloud components with a velocity separation of $\sim$2 km s$^{-1}$ toward G11P1. Overall, the collision process, the ``fray and fragment'' mechanism, and the ``global non-isotropic collapse'' scenario seem to be operational in G11.

 - **Abstract**
 Dust emission is an important tool in studies of star-forming clouds, as a tracer of column density and indirectly via the dust evolution that is connected to the history and physical conditions of the clouds. We examine radiative transfer (RT) modelling of dust emission over an extended cloud region, using a filament in the Taurus molecular cloud as an example. We examine how well far-infrared observations can be used to determine both the cloud and the dust properties. Using different assumptions of the cloud shape, radiation field, and dust properties, we fit RT models to Herschel observations of the Taurus filament. Further comparisons are made with measurements of the near-infrared extinction. The models are used to examine the degeneracies between the different cloud parameters and the dust properties. The results show significant dependence on the assumed cloud structure and the spectral shape of the external radiation field. If these are constrained to the most likely values, the observations can be explained only if the dust far-infrared (FIR) opacity has increased by a factor of 2-3 relative to the values in diffuse medium. However, a narrow range of FIR wavelengths provides only weak evidence of the spatial variations in dust, even in the models covering several square degrees of a molecular cloud. The analysis of FIR dust emission is affected by several sources of uncertainty. Further constraints are therefore needed from observations at shorter wavelengths, especially regarding the trends in dust evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We confirm the planetary nature of TOI-5344 b as a transiting giant exoplanet around an M0 dwarf star. TOI-5344 b was discovered with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite photometry and confirmed with ground-based photometry (the Red Buttes Observatory 0.6m telescope), radial velocity (the Habitable-zone Planet Finder), and speckle imaging (the NN-Explore Exoplanet Stellar Speckle Imager). TOI-5344 b is a Saturn-like giant planet ($\rho = 0.80^{+0.17}_{-0.15}\ \text{g cm}^{-3}$) with a planetary radius of $9.7 \pm \ 0.5 \ \text{R}_{\oplus}$ ($0.87 \pm \ 0.04 \ \text{R}_{\text{Jup}}$) and a planetary mass of $135^{+17}_{-18} \text{M}_{\oplus}$ ($0.42^{+0.05}_{-0.06} \ \text{M}_{\text{Jup}}$). It has an orbital period of $3.792622 \pm 0.000010$ days and an orbital eccentricity of $0.06^{+0.07}_{-0.04}$. We measure a high metallicity for TOI-5344 of [Fe/H] = $0.48 \pm 0.12$, where the high metallicity is consistent with expectations from formation through core accretion. We compare the metallicity of the M-dwarf hosts of giant exoplanets to that of M-dwarf hosts of non-giants ($\lesssim 8\ \text{R}_{\oplus}$). While the two populations appear to show different metallicity distributions, quantitative tests are prohibited by various sample caveats.

 - **Abstract**
 State-of-the-art surveys reveal that most massive stars in the universe evolve in close binaries. Massive stars in such systems are expected to develop aspherical envelopes due to tidal interactions and/or rotational effects. Recently, it was shown that point explosions in oblate stars can produce relativistic equatorial ring-like outflows. Moreover, since stripped-envelope stars in binaries can expand enough to fill their Roche lobes anew, it is likely that these stars die with a greater degree of asphericity than the oblate spheroid geometry previously studied. We investigate the effects of this asymmetry by studying the gas dynamics of axisymmetric point explosions in stars in various stages of filling their Roche lobes. We find that point explosions in these pear-shaped stars produce trans-relativistic ejecta that coalesces into bullets pointed both toward and away from the binary companion. We present this result and comment on key morphological differences between core-collapse explosions in spherical versus distorted stars in binary systems, effects on gravitational wave sources, and observational signatures that could be used to glean these explosion geometries from current and future surveys.
#### Observing the LMC with APEX: Signatures of Large-scale Feedback in the  Molecular Clouds of 30 Doradus

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.20701
 - **Abstract**
 Stellar feedback plays a crucial role in star formation and the life cycle of molecular clouds. The intense star formation region 30 Doradus, which is located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), is a unique target for detailed investigation of stellar feedback owing to the proximity of the hosting galaxy and modern observational capabilities that together allow us to resolve individual molecular clouds $-$ nurseries of star formation. We study the impact of large-scale feedback on the molecular gas using the new observational data in the $^{12}$CO(3$-$2) line obtained with the APEX telescope. Our data cover an unprecedented area of 13.9 sq. deg. of the LMC disc with a spatial resolution of 5 pc and provide an unbiased view on the molecular clouds in the galaxy. Using this data, we locate molecular clouds in the disc of the galaxy, estimate their properties such as the areal number density, relative velocity and separation, width of the line profile, CO-line luminosity, size, virial mass and compare these properties between the clouds of 30 Doradus and those in the rest of the LMC disc. We find that compared with the rest of the observed molecular clouds in the LMC disc, those in 30 Doradus show the highest areal number density; they are spatially more clustered, move faster with respect to each other and feature larger linewidths. In parallel, we do not find statistically significant differences in such properties as the CO-line luminosity, size, and virial mass between the clouds of 30 Doradus and the rest of the observed field. We interpret our results as signatures of gas dispersal and fragmentation due to high-energy large-scale feedback.
