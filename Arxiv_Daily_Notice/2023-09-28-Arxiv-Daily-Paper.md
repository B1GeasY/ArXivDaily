 - **Abstract**
 As comets journey into the inner solar system, they deliver particulates and volatile gases into their comae that reveal the most primitive materials in the solar system. Cometary dust particles provide crucial information for assessing the physico-chemical conditions in the outer disk from which they formed. Compared to the volatiles and soluble organics, the refractory dust particles are more robust and may be traceable to other small bodies. Using data from the Spitzer Heritage Archive, we present thermal dust models of 57 observations of 33 comets observed spectroscopically with the NASA Spitzer Space Telescope. This comet spectral survey offers the opportunity to study comets with data from the same instrument, reduced by the same methods, and fitted by the same thermal model using the same optical constants. The submicron dust tends to be dominated by amorphous carbon, and the submicron silicate mass tends to be dominated by amorphous silicate materials. We discuss the implications of these findings as they relate to Mg-rich crystalline silicates, which are high-temperature condensates, as well as to potential ion irradiation of amorphous Mg:Fe silicates prior to their incorporation into comets. These results impact our understandings of the protoplanetary disk conditions of planetesimal formation. Lastly, we cannot definitively conclude that a distinct difference exists in the dust composition between Oort cloud and Jupiter-family comet dynamical population as a whole.
#### Evolution of a Water-rich Atmosphere Formed by a Giant Impact on an  Earth-sized Planet

 - **Abstract**
 The atmosphere of a terrestrial planet that is replenished with secondary gases should have accumulated hydrogen-rich gas from its protoplanetary disk. Although a giant impact blows off a large fraction of the primordial atmosphere of a terrestrial planet in the late formation stage, the remaining atmosphere can become water-rich via chemical reactions between hydrogen and vaporized core material. We find that a water-rich post-impact atmosphere forms when a basaltic or CI chondrite core is assumed. In contrast, little post-impact water is generated for an enstatite chondrite core. We investigate the X-ray- and UV-driven mass loss from an Earth-mass planet with an impact-induced multi-component H$_2$$-$He$-$H$_2$O atmosphere for Gyrs. We show that water is left in the atmosphere of an Earth-mass planet when the low flux of escaping hydrogen cannot drag water upward via collisions. For a water-dominated atmosphere to form, the atmospheric mass fraction of an Earth-mass planet with an oxidizing core after a giant impact must be less than a few times 0.1%. We also find that Earth-mass planets with water-dominated atmospheres can exist at semimajor axes ranging from a few times 0.1 au to a few au around a Sun-like star depending on the mass loss efficiency. Such planets are important targets for atmospheric characterization in the era of JWST. Our results indicate that efficient mixing between hydrogen and rocky components during giant impacts can play a role in the production of water in an Earth-mass planet.
#### In search of gravity mode signatures in main sequence solar-type stars  observed by Kepler

 - **Abstract**
 Gravity modes (g modes), mixed gravito-acoustic modes (mixed modes), and gravito-inertial modes (gi modes) possess unmatched properties as probes for stars with radiative interiors. The structural and dynamical constraints that they are able to provide cannot be accessed by other means. While they provide precious insights into the internal dynamics of evolved stars as well as massive and intermediate-mass stars, their non-detection in main sequence (MS) solar-type stars make them a crucial missing piece in our understanding of angular momentum transport in radiative zones and stellar rotational evolution. In this work, we aim to apply certain analysis tools originally developed for helioseismology in order to look for g-mode signatures in MS solar-type stars. We select a sample of the 34 most promising MS solar-type stars with Kepler four-year long photometric time series. All these stars are well-characterised late F-type stars with thin convective envelopes, fast convective flows, and stochastically excited acoustic modes (p modes). For each star, we compute the background noise level of the Fourier power spectrum to identify significant peaks at low frequency. After successfully detecting individual peaks in 12 targets, we further analyse four of them and observe distinct patterns of surrounding peaks with a low probability of being noise artifacts. Comparisons with the predictions from reference models suggest that these patterns are compatible with the presence of non-asymptotic low-order pure g modes, pure p modes, and mixed modes. Given their sensitivity to both the convective core interface stratification and the coupling between p- and g-mode resonant cavities, such modes are able to provide strong constraints on the structure and evolutionary states of the related targets.

#### Enabling multi-messenger astronomy with continuous gravitational waves:  early warning and sky localization of binary neutron stars in Einstein  Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors will provide unprecedented sensitivity to inspiraling binary neutron stars and black holes, enabling detections at the peak of star formation and beyond. However, the signals from these systems will last much longer than those in current detectors, and overlap in both time and frequency, leading to increased computational cost to search for them with standard matched filtering analyses, and a higher probability that they are observed in the presence of non-Gaussian noise. We therefore present a method to search for gravitational waves from compact binary inspirals in next-generation detectors that is computationally efficient and robust against gaps in data collection and noise non-stationarities. Our method, based on the Hough Transform, finds tracks in the time/frequency plane of the detector that uniquely describe specific inspiraling systems. We find that we could detect $\sim 5$ overlapping, intermediate-strength signals without a sensitivity loss. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method can enable multi-messenger astronomy: using only low frequencies ($2-20$ Hz), we could warn astronomers $\sim 2.5$ hours before a GW170817-like merger at 40 Mpc and provide a sky localization of $\sim 20$ deg$^2$ using only one interferometer. Additionally, assuming that primordial black holes (PBHs) exist, we derive projected constraints on the fraction of dark matter they could compose, $f_{\rm PBH}\sim 10^{-6}-10^{-4}$, for $\sim 1-0.1M_\odot$ equal-mass systems, respectively, using a rate suppression factor $f_{\rm sup}=2.5\times 10^{-3}$. Our method only incurs a strain sensitivity loss of a factor of a few at binary neutron star masses compared to the matched filter, which may be reduced depending on available computational power.
