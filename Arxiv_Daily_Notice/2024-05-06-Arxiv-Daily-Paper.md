 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational-wave detectors are now making it possible to investigate how the merger rate of binary black holes (BBHs) evolves with redshift. In this study, we examine whether the BBH merger rate of isolated binaries deviates from a scaled star formation rate density (SFRD) -- a frequently used model in state-of-the-art research. To address this question, we conduct population synthesis simulations using COMPAS with a grid of stellar evolution models, calculate their cosmological merger rates, and compare them to a scaled SFRD. We find that our simulated rates deviate by factors up to $3.5\times$ at $z\sim0$ and $5\times$ at $z\sim 9$ due to two main phenomena: (i) The formation efficiency of BBHs is an order of magnitude higher at low metallicities than at solar metallicity; and (ii) BBHs experience a wide range of delays (from a few Myr to many Gyr) between formation and merger. Deviations are similar when comparing to a $\textit{delayed}$ SFRD, and even larger (up to $\sim 10\times$) when comparing to SFRD-based models scaled to the local merger rate. Interestingly, our simulations find that the BBH delay time distribution is redshift-dependent, increasing the complexity of the redshift distribution of mergers. We find similar results for simulated merger rates of BHNSs and BNSs. We conclude that the rate of BBH, BHNS, and BNS mergers from the isolated channel can significantly deviate from a scaled SFRD, and that future measurements of the merger rate will provide insights into the formation pathways of gravitational-wave sources.

 - **Abstract**
 To study the impact of the initial effects of metallicity (i.e., the abundance of elements heavier than helium) on star formation and the formation of different molecular species, we searched for hot molecular cores in the sub-solar metallicity environment of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We conducted an ALMA Band 6 observations of 20 fields centered on young stellar objects (YSOs) distributed over the LMC in order to search for hot molecular cores in this galaxy. We detected a total of 65 compact 1.2 mm continuum cores in the 20 ALMA fields and analyzed their spectra with XCLASS software. The main temperature tracers are CH3OH and SO2, with more than two transitions detected in the observed frequency ranges. Other molecular lines with high detection rates in our sample are CS , SO, H13CO+, H13CN, HC15 N, and SiO. More complex molecules, such as HNCO, HDCO, HC3N, CH3CN, and NH2CHO, and multiple transitions of SO and SO2 isotopologues showed tentative or definite detection toward a small subset of the cores. According to the chemical richness of the cores and high temperatures from the XCLASS fitting, we report the detection of four hot cores and one hot core candidate. With one new hot core detection in this study, the number of detected hot cores in the LMC increases to seven. Six out of seven hot cores detected in the LMC to date are located in the stellar bar region of this galaxy. These six hot cores show emission from complex organic molecules (COMs), such as CH3OH, CH3CN, CH3OCHO, and CH3OCH3. The only known hot core in the LMC with no detection of COMs is located outside the bar region. The metallicity in the LMC presents a shallow gradient increasing from outer regions toward the bar. We suggest that the formation of hot molecular cores containing COMs ensues from the new generation of stars forming in the more metal-rich environment of the LMC bar.

 - **Abstract**
 Acetylene, among the multitude of organic molecules discovered in space, plays a distinct role in the genesis of organic matter. Characterized by its unique balance of stability and reactivity, acetylene is the simplest unsaturated organic molecule known to have a triple bond. In addition to its inherent chemical properties, acetylene is one of the most prevalent organic molecules found across the Universe, spanning from the icy surfaces of planets and satellites and the cold interstellar medium with low temperatures to hot circumstellar envelopes where temperatures surge to several thousand kelvins. These factors collectively position acetylene as a crucial building block in the molecular diversification of organic molecules and solids present in space. This review comprehensively discusses the formation and expansion of carbon skeletons involving acetylene, ranging from the formation of simple molecules to the origination of the first aromatic ring and ultimately to the formation of nanosized carbon particles. Mechanisms pertinent to both hot environments, such as circumstellar envelopes, and cold environments, including molecular clouds and planetary atmospheres, are explored. In addition, this review contemplates the role of acetylene in the synthesis of prebiotic molecules. A distinct focus is accorded to the recent advancements and future prospects of research into catalytic processes involving acetylene molecules, which is a significant instrument in driving the evolution of carbon complexity in the Universe. The insights garnered from this review underline the significance of acetylene in astrochemistry and potentially contribute to our understanding of the chemical evolution of the Universe.
#### Laboratory and astronomical discovery of cyanothioketene, NCCHCS, in the  cold starless core TMC-1

 - **Abstract**
 We present the detection of cyanothioketene, NCCHCS, in the laboratory and toward TMC-1. This transient species was produced through a discharge of a gas mixture of CH2CHCN and CS2 using argon as carrier gas, and its rotational spectrum between 9 and 40 GHz was characterized using a Balle-Flygare narrowband-type Fourier-transform microwave spectrometer. A total of 21 rotational transitions were detected in the laboratory, all of them exhibiting hyperfine structure induced by the spin of the N nucleus. The spectrum for NCCHCS was predicted in the domain of our line surveys using the derived rotational and distortion constants. The detection in the cold starless core TMC-1 was based on the QUIJOTE line survey performed with the Yebes 40m radio telescope. Twenty-three lines were detected with K_a=0, 1, and 2 and J_u=9 up to 14. The derived column density is (1.2+/-0.1)e11 cm-2 for a rotational temperature of 8.5+/-1 K. The abundance ratio of thioketene and its cyano derivative, H2CCS/NCCHCS, is 6.5+/-1.3. Although ketene is more abundant than thioketene by about 15 times, its cyano derivative NCCHCO surprisingly is not detected with a 3sigma upper level to the column density of 3.0e10 cm-2, which results in an abundance ratio H2CCO/NCCHCO > 430. Hence, the chemistry of CN derivatives seems to be more favored for S-bearing than for O-bearing molecules. We carried out chemical modeling calculations and found that the gas-phase neutral-neutral reactions CCN + H2CS and CN + H2CCS could be a source of NCCHCS in TMC-1.

 - **Abstract**
 The CO-dark molecular gas (DMG), which refers to the molecular gas not traced by CO emission, is crucial for the evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM). While the gas properties of DMG have been widely explored in the Solar neighborhood, whether or not they are similar in the outer disk regions of the Milky Way is still not well understood. In this Letter, we confirm the existence of DMG toward a cold HI arc structure at 13 kpc away from the Galactic center with both OH emission and HI narrow self-absorption (HINSA). This is the first detection of HINSA in the outer disk region, in which the HINSA fraction ($N_{\rm HINSA}$/$N_{\rm H_2}$ = 0.022$\pm$0.011) is an order of magnitude higher than the average value observed in nearby evolved dark clouds, but is consistent with that of the early evolutionary stage of dark clouds. The inferred H$_2$ column density from both extinction and OH emission ($N_{\rm H_2} \approx 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$) is an order of magnitude higher than previously estimated. Although the ISM environmental parameters are expected to be different between the outer Galactic disk regions and the Solar neighborhood, we find that the visual extinction ($A_{\rm V}$ = 0.19$\pm$0.03 mag), H$_2$-gas density ($n_{\rm H_2} = 91\pm46$ cm$^{-3}$), and molecular fraction (58\%$\pm$28\%) of the DMG are rather similar to those of nearby diffuse molecular clouds. The existence of DMG associated with the expanding HI supershell supports a scenario where the expansion of supershells may trigger the formation of molecular clouds within a crossing timescale of the shock wave ($\sim$10$^6$ yr).

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first fully and inherently relativistic derivation of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. This work uses the formalism historically used to compute radiation spectra emerging from inverse Thomson/Compton sources of x-ray radiation. Comparing our results to the traditional approach based on relativistically-corrected classical Kompaneets equation, we find small, but systematic differences. Most notable are the modest (< 10 %) differences in the crossover frequency where the spectral distortion due to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect vanishes, and the energy increase of the distribution at high electron cloud temperatures.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of very early high-resolution spectroscopic observations of the nearby core-collapse (CC) supernova (SN) 2024ggi, a Type II SN that ocurred in the galaxy NGC 3621, at a distance of 7.11 Mpc ($z\approx0.002435$). These observations represent the earliest high-resolution spectroscopy of a CCSN ever made. We analyze the very early-phase spectroscopic evolution of SN 2024ggi obtained in a short interval at 26.6 and 33.8h after the SN first light. Observations were obtained with the high-resolution spectrograph MIKE ($R\approx22600-28000$) at the 6.5m Magellan Clay Telescope, located at the Las Campanas Observatory, during the night of 2024-04-12UT. We constrain emission line features in the early-phase spectroscopic evolution of SN 2024ggi. We analyze the evolution of main spectroscopic features and the occurrence of high-ionization emission lines, by estimating their full width at half maximum (FWHM), equivalent width (EW), and blueshift velocities. We then compare our results to other early-time observations of CCSNe. The spectra show strong and narrow features of Balmer emission lines and of high-ionization species of HeI, HeII, NIII, CIII, together with relatively broader emission features of NIV and CIV. Some of these features become broader or disappear in the interval of 8h, indicating the rapid changes in the early evolution of CCSNe flash-ionization features. The HeII, CIV, NIV and Balmer emission lines have asymmetric Lorentzian profiles, with the HeII $\lambda4686$ broad component showing blue wings that extends up to $\sim-1000$ km s$^{-1}$. We also measure a CSM expansion velocity of $\sim 79 \ \textrm{km} \ \textrm{s}^{-1}$ from the blueshift in the H$\alpha$ emission profile, and a total extinction in the line of sight of $E(B-V)=0.16$ mag. Finally, we note many similarities of SN 2024ggi to the early evolution of SN 2023ixf.
