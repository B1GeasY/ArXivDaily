 - **Abstract**
 The blue supergiant (BSG) domain contains a large variety of stars whose past and future evolutionary paths are still highly uncertain. Since binary interaction plays a crucial role in the fate of massive stars, investigating the multiplicity among BSGs helps shed light on the fate of such objects. We aim to estimate the binary fraction of a large sample of BSGs in the Small Magellanic Cloud within the Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM) survey. In total, we selected 262 targets with spectral types B0-B3 and luminosity classes I-II. This work is based on spectroscopic data collected by the GIRAFFE instrument, mounted on the Very Large Telescope, which gathered nine epochs over three months. Our spectroscopic analysis for each target includes the individual and peak-to-peak radial velocity measurements, an investigation of the line profile variability, and a periodogram analysis to search for possible short- and long-period binaries. By applying a 20 km s$^{-1}$ threshold on the peak-to-peak radial velocities above which we would consider the star to be binary, the resulting observed spectroscopic binary fraction for our BSG sample is 23 $\pm$ 3$\%$. In addition, we derived reliable orbital periods for 41 spectroscopic binaries and potential binary candidates, among which there are 17 eclipsing binaries, including 20 SB1 and SB2 systems with periods of less than 10 days. We reported a significant drop in the binary fraction of BSGs with spectral types later than B2 and effective temperatures less than 18 kK, which could indicate the end of the main sequence phase in this temperature regime. We found no metallicity dependence in the binary fraction of BSGs, compared to existing spectroscopic surveys of the Galaxy and Large Magellanic Cloud.
#### Evidence of Galactic Interaction in the Small Magellanic Cloud Probed by Gaia Selected Massive Star Candidates

 - **Abstract**
 We present identifications and kinematic analysis of 7,426 massive ($\mathrm{\geq}8M_{\odot}$) stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), using Gaia DR3 data. We used Gaia ($G_\mathrm{BP}-G_\mathrm{RP}$, $G$) color-magnitude diagram to select the population of massive stars, and parallax to omit foreground objects. The spatial distribution of the 7,426 massive star candidates is generally consistent with the spatial distribution of the interstellar medium, such as H$\alpha$ and H i emission. The identified massive stars show inhomogeneous distributions over the galaxy, showing several superstructures formed by massive stars with several hundred parsecs scale. The stellar superstructures defined by the surface density have opposite mean proper motions in the east and west, moving away from each other. Similarly, the mean line-of-sight velocities of the superstructures are larger to the southeast and smaller to the northwest. The different east-west properties of the superstructures' proper motion, line-of-sight velocity indicate that the SMC is being stretched by tidal forces and/or ram pressure from the Large Magellanic Cloud to the southeast, thereby rejecting the presence of galaxy rotation in the SMC.

 - **Abstract**
 Using spatially resolved spectroscopic data from the MaNGA sample, we investigate the parameters influencing the radial gradients of gas-phase metallicity ($\nabla\log(\mathrm{O/H})$), to determine whether disk formation is primarily driven by coplanar gas inflow or by the independent evolution of distinct regions within the disk. Our results show that $\nabla \log(\mathrm{O/H})$ strongly correlates with local gas-phase metallicity at a given stellar mass, with steeper gradients observed in metal-poorer disks. This trend supports the coplanar gas inflow scenario, wherein the gas is progressively enriched by in situ star formation as it flows inward. In contrast, the radial gradient of stellar mass surface density shows very weak correlations with $\nabla \log(\mathrm{O/H})$, which is inconsistent with the independent evolution mode, where gas inflow, star formation, and metal enrichment occur independently within each annulus of the disk. Furthermore, we find that $\nabla \log(\mathrm{O/H})$ is also closely correlated with an indicator of local gas turbulence $\sigma_{\mathrm{gas}}/R_{\mathrm{e}}$, highlighting the competing roles of turbulence and coplanar inflow in shaping metallicity gradients. Our results provide indirect observational evidence supporting coplanar gas inflow as the driving mechanism for disk evolution.
#### Preparing for the 2061 return of Halley's comet -- A rendezvous mission with an innovative imaging system

 - **Abstract**
 The return of Comet 1P/Halley will promote a wide interest for ground and space observations of a celestial body of outstanding scientific and cultural interest. In addition to remote observations, space will open the possibility of in situ science similarly to the passage of 1986. In this paper, we first discuss the scientific motivations for a rendezvous mission, capable to overcome the limitations of the flyby missions that took place at that time. In the second part, we describe an example of a rendezvous trajectory that can be carried out with existing power and propulsion technologies. The transfer is made possible by the gravitational assistance of a giant planet. The resulting mission will be capable to reach the comet beyond the distance of Saturn, when the sublimation of super-volatile species will be ongoing, and well before the onset of the sublimation of water (4 AU). After rendezvous, the spacecraft will accompany the comet for several years before, around and after perihelion (July 2061). Our concept mission does not foresee the implementation of solar panels. In this way, operations can occur even inside the dense dust coma at short distance from the nucleus. In the third part of the paper, an innovative imaging system is proposed, with a very large field of view (100°) capable to record on the same frame details on the surface and the surrounding space, in order to follow for several degrees the trajectories of chunks and clouds ejected by pits or fractures, crucial to the understanding of the cometary activity. A concerted effort is needed in the current decade to plan and approve a rendezvous mission to 1P. Indeed, the scenario here described requires launching before 2040, less than 15 years from now. Later launches imply a severe loss of scientific knowledge, because the spacecraft will not be able to reach the comet before the onset of water sublimation.
#### Equivalence of Dark Energy Models: A Theoretical and Bayesian Perspective

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the background equivalence among three dark energy models by constructing explicit mappings between dynamical dark energy (DDE), interacting dark energy (IDE), and running vacuum (RV). In our approach, the dark sector functions that characterize each model-such as the equation of state parameter $\bar{w}(a)$ for DDE, the interaction term $Q$ for IDE, and the functional form $\Lambda(H)$ for RV-are transformed into one another under specific assumptions. Extending previous work by von Marttens et al., we demonstrate that running vacuum models, characterized by $\Lambda(H) = a_0 + a_1 \dot{H} + a_2 H^2$, can be reinterpreted as an interacting dark energy model with $Q = 3H\gamma \hat{\rho}_c$, which in turn is equivalent to a dynamic dark energy model with an appropriately defined $\bar{w}(a)$. Using Bayesian analysis with Type Ia supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and Cosmic Chronometers, our observational constraints confirm that these theoretical equivalences hold at the background level. This study underscores the importance of seeking convergence in dark energy models, facilitating a better understanding of the dark sector.

 - **Abstract**
 Machine learning methods are well established in the classification of quasars (QSOs). However, the advent of light curve observations adds a great amount of complexity to the problem. Our goal is to use the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to create a catalog of QSOs. We process the ZTF DR20 light curves with a transformer artificial neural network and combine the Pan-STARRS (PS), AllWISE, and Gaia surveys with extreme gradient boosting. Using ZTF g-band data with at least 100 observational epochs per light curve, we obtain 97% F1 score for QSOs. We find that with 3 day median cadence, a survey time span of at least 900 days is required to achieve 90% QSO F1 score. However, one can obtain the same score with a survey time span of 1800 days and the median cadence prolonged to 12 days. We find that ZTF classification is superior to the PS static bands, and on par with WISE and Gaia measurements. Additionally, we find that the light curves provide the most important features for QSO classification in the ZTF dataset. We robustly classify objects fainter than the $5\sigma$ SNR limit at $g=20.8$ by requiring $g < \mathrm{n_{obs}} / 80 + 20.375$. For this sample, we run inference with added WISE observations, and find 4,849,574 objects classified as QSOs. For 33% of QZO objects, with available WISE data, we publish redshifts with estimated error $\Delta z/(1 + z) = 0.14$.
