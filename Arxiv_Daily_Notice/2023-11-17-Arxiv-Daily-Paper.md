#### Probing diffuse radio emission in bridges between galaxy clusters with  uGMRT
 - **Authors:** G.V. Pignataro, A. Bonafede, G. Bernardi, C.J. Riseley, D. Dallacasa, T. Venturi

 - **Abstract**
 The main purpose of this work is to investigate the properties of the non-thermal emission in the interacting clusters pairs Abell 0399-Abell 0401 and Abell 21-PSZ2 G114.9, found in an interacting state. In both cases their connection along a filament is supported by SZ effect detected by the Planck satellite and, in the special case of Abell 0399-Abell 0401, the presence of a radio bridge has been already confirmed by LOFAR observations at 140MHz. Here, we analyse new high sensitivity wideband (250-500MHz) uGMRT data of these two systems and describe an injection procedure to place limits on the spectrum of Abell 0399-Abell 0401 and on the radio emission between Abell 21-PSZ2 G114.9. For the A399-A401 pair, we are able to constrain the steep spectral index of the bridge emission to be alpha>2.2 with a 95% confidence level between 140MHz and 400MHz. For the A21-PSZ2 G114.9 pair, we are able to place an upper limit on the flux density of the bridge emission with two different methods, finding at the central frequency of 383MHz a conservative value of fu_1<260mJy at 95% confidence level, and a lower value of fu_2<125mJy at 80% confidence level, based on visual inspection and a morphological criterion. Our work provides a constraint on the spectrum in the bridge A399-A401 which disfavours shock-acceleration as the main mechanism for the radio emission.
#### The Structure and Evolution of Relativistic Jetted Blast Waves
 - **Authors:** Taya Govreen-Segal, Ehud Nakar
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09297
 - **Abstract**
 We study, analytically and numerically, the structure and evolution of relativistic jetted blast waves that propagate in uniform media, such as those that generate afterglows of gamma-ray bursts. Similar to previous studies, we find that the evolution can be divided into two parts: (i) a pre-spreading phase, in which the jet core angle is roughly constant, $\theta_{c,0}$, and the shock Lorentz factor along the axis, $\Gamma_a$, evolves as a part of the Blandford-Mckee solution, and (ii) a spreading phase, in which $\Gamma_a$ drops exponentially with the radius and the core angle, $\theta_c$, grows rapidly. Nevertheless, the jet remains collimated during the relativistic phase, where $\theta_c(\Gamma_a\beta_a=1)\simeq 0.4\theta_{c,0}^{1/3}$. The transition between the phases takes place when $\Gamma_a\simeq 0.2\theta_{c,0}^{-1}$. We find that the "wings" of jets with initial "narrow" structure ($\frac{d \log\,E_{iso}}{d\log\,\theta}<-3$ outside of the core, where $E_{iso}$ is isotropic equivalent energy), start evolving during the pre-spreading phase. By the spreading phase these jets evolve to a self-similar profile, which is independent of the initial structure, where in the wings $\Gamma(\theta)\propto\theta^{-1.5}$ and $E_{iso}(\theta)\propto \theta^{-2.6}$. Jets with initial "wide" structure roughly keep their initial profile during their entire evolution. We provide analytic description of the jet lateral profile evolution for a range of initial structures, as well as the evolution of $\Gamma_a$ and $\theta_c$. For off-axis GRBs, we present a relation between the initial jet structure and the light curve rising phase. Applying our model to GW170817, we find that initially the jet had $\theta_{c,0}=0.4-4.5~\deg$ and wings which are consistent with $E_{iso} \propto \theta^{-3}-\theta^{-4}$.
#### Delayed X-ray brightening accompanied by variable ionized absorption  following a tidal disruption event

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive black holes can experience super-Eddington peak mass fallback rates following the tidal disruption of a star. The theoretical expectation is that part of the infalling material is expelled by means of an accretion disk wind, whose observational signature includes blueshifted absorption lines of highly ionized species in X-ray spectra. To date, however, only one such ultra-fast outflow (UFO) has been reported in the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-14li. Here we report on the discovery of transient absorption-like signatures in X-ray spectra of the TDE AT2020ksf/Gaia20cjk (at a redshift of $z$=0.092), following an X-ray brightening $\sim 230$ days after UV/optical peak. We find that while no statistically significant absorption features are present initially, they appear on a timescale of several days, and remain detected up to 770 days after peak. Simple thermal continuum models, combined with a power-law or neutral absorber, do not describe these features well. Adding a partial covering, low velocity ionized absorber improves the fit at early times, but fails at late times. A high velocity (v$_w$ $\sim$ 42000 km s$^{-1}$, or -0.15c), ionized absorber (ultra-fast outflow) provides a good fit to all data. The few day timescale of variability is consistent with expectations for a clumpy wind. We discuss several scenarios that could explain the X-ray delay, as well as the potential for larger scale wind feedback. The serendipitous nature of the discovery could suggest a high incidence of UFOs in TDEs, alleviating some of the tension with theoretical expectations.
#### All We Are Is Dust In The WIM: Constraints on Dust Properties in the  Milky Way's Warm Ionized Medium

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comparison of the presence and properties of dust in two distinct phases of the Milky Way's interstellar medium: the warm neutral medium (WNM) and the warm ionized medium (WIM). Using distant pulsars at high Galactic latitudes and vertical distance ($|b| > 40\deg$, $D \sin|b| > 2 \mathrm{\,\, kpc}$) as probes, we measure their dispersion measures and the neutral hydrogen component of the warm neutral medium ($\text{WNM}_\text{HI}$) using HI column density. Together with dust intensity along these same sightlines, we separate the respective dust contributions of each ISM phase in order to determine whether the ionized component contributes to the dust signal. We measure the temperature ($T$), spectral index ($\beta$), and dust opacity ($\tau/N_{H}$) in both phases. We find $T~{\text{(WNM}_\text{HI})}=20^{+3}_{-2}$~K, $\beta~{\text{(WNM}_\text{HI})} = 1.5\pm{0.4}$, and $\tau_{\text{353}}/N_{H}~{\text{(WNM}_\text{HI})}=(1.0\pm0.1)\times 10^{-26}$~cm$^2$. Assuming that the temperature and spectral index are the same in both the WNM$_\text{HI}$ and WIM, and given our simple model that widely separated lines-of-sight can be fit together, we find evidence that there is a dust signal associated with the ionized gas and $\tau_{\text{353}}/N_{H}~\text{(WIM)}=(0.3\pm0.3)\times 10^{-26}$, which is about three times smaller than $\tau_{\text{353}}/N_{H}~{\text{(WNM}_\text{HI})}$. We are 80% confident that $\tau_{\text{353}}/N_{H}~\text{(WIM)}$ is at least two times smaller than $\tau_{\text{353}}/N_{H}~{\text{(WNM}_\text{HI})}$.
#### First Sagittarius A* Event Horizon Telescope Results. III: Imaging of  the Galactic Center Supermassive Black Hole
 - **Authors:** Authors: The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09479
 - **Abstract**
 We present the first event-horizon-scale images and spatiotemporal analysis of Sgr A* taken with the Event Horizon Telescope in 2017 April at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. Imaging of Sgr A* has been conducted through surveys over a wide range of imaging assumptions using the classical CLEAN algorithm, regularized maximum likelihood methods, and a Bayesian posterior sampling method. Different prescriptions have been used to account for scattering effects by the interstellar medium towards the Galactic Center. Mitigation of the rapid intra-day variability that characterizes Sgr A* has been carried out through the addition of a "variability noise budget" in the observed visibilities, facilitating the reconstruction of static full-track images. Our static reconstructions of Sgr A* can be clustered into four representative morphologies that correspond to ring images with three different azimuthal brightness distributions, and a small cluster that contains diverse non-ring morphologies. Based on our extensive analysis of the effects of sparse $(u,v)$-coverage, source variability and interstellar scattering, as well as studies of simulated visibility data, we conclude that the Event Horizon Telescope Sgr A* data show compelling evidence for an image that is dominated by a bright ring of emission with a ring diameter of $\sim$ 50 $\mu$as, consistent with the expected "shadow" of a $4\times10^6 M_\odot$ black hole in the Galactic Center located at a distance of 8 kpc.
#### Warp and flare of the old Galactic disc as traced by the red clump stars

 - **Abstract**
 Our study aims to investigate the outer disc structure of the Milky Way galaxy using the red clump (RC) stars. We analysed the distribution of the largest sample of RC stars to date, homogeneously covering the entire Galactic plane in the range of $40^\circ \le \ell \le 340^\circ$ and $-10^\circ \le b \le +10^\circ$. This sample allows us to model the RC star distribution in the Galactic disc to better constrain the properties of the flare and warp of the Galaxy. Our results show that the scale length of the old stellar disc weakly depends on azimuth, with an average value of $1.95 \pm0.26$ kpc. On the other hand, a significant disc flaring is detected, where the scale height of the disc increases from 0.38 kpc in the solar neighbourhood to $\sim 2.2$ kpc at R $\approx 15$ kpc. The flare exhibits a slight asymmetry, with $\sim 1$ kpc more scale height below the Galactic plane as compared to the Northern flare. We also confirm the warping of the outer disc, which can be modelled with $Z_w = (0.0057 \pm 0.0050)~ [R-(7358 \pm 368) (pc)]^{1.40 \pm 0.09} \sin(\phi - (-2^\circ.03 \pm 0^\circ .18))$. Our analysis reveals a noticeable north-south asymmetry in the warp, with a greater amplitude observed in the southern direction compared to the northern. Comparing our findings with younger tracers from the literature, we observe an age dependency of both the flare and warp. An increase in flare strength with age suggests the secular evolution of the disc as the preferred mechanism for forming the flare. The increase of the maximum warp amplitude with age indicates that the warp dynamics could be the possible cause of the variation in the warp properties with age.
#### PSR J$0952-0607$ and GW170817: Direct Multimessenger Constraints on  Neutron Star Equation of State through a Novel Wide-ranging Correlation

 - **Abstract**
 Our knowledge about neutron star (NS) masses is renewed once again due to the recognition of the heaviest NS PSR J$ 0952-0607 $. By taking advantage of both mass observations of super massive neutron stars and the tidal deformability derived from event GW170817, a joint constraint on tidal deformability is obtained. A wide-ranging correlation between NS pressure and tidal deformability within the density range from saturation density $\rho_0$ to $5.6\rho_0$ is discovered, which directly yields a constrained NS EoS. The newly constrained EoS has a small uncertainty and a softer behavior at high densities without the inclusion of extra degrees of freedom, which shows its potential to be used as an indicator for the component of NS core.
#### Probing cosmology via the clustering of critical points

 - **Abstract**
 Exclusion zones in the cross-correlations between critical points (peak-void, peak-wall, filament-wall, filament-void) of the density field define quasi-standard rulers that can be used to constrain dark matter and dark energy cosmological parameters. The average size of the exclusion zone is found to scale linearly with the typical distance between extrema. The latter changes as a function of the matter content of the universe in a predictable manner, but its comoving size remains essentially constant in the linear regime of structure growth on large scales, unless the incorrect cosmology is assumed in the redshift-distance relation. This can be used to constrain the dark energy parameters when considering a survey that scans a range of redshifts. The precision of the parameter estimation is assessed using a set of cosmological simulations, and is found to be a 4$\sigma$ detection of a change in matter content of 5%, or about 3.8$\sigma$ detection of 50% shift in the dark energy parameter using a full sky survey up to redshift 0.5.

 - **Abstract**
 Collisional (de-)excitation of H$_{2}$ by helium plays an important role in the thermal balance and chemistry of various astrophysical environments, making accurate rate coefficients essential for the interpretation of observations of the interstellar medium. Our goal is to utilize a state-of-the-art potential energy surface (PES) to provide comprehensive state-to-state rate coefficients for He-induced transitions among rovibrational levels of H$_{2}$. We perform quantum scattering calculations for the H$_{2}$-He system and provide state-to-state rate coefficients for 1 089 transitions between rovibrational levels of H$_{2}$ with internal energies up to 15 000 cm$^{-1}$ for temperatures ranging from 20 to 8 000 K. Our results show good agreement with previous calculations for pure rotational transitions between low-lying rotational levels, but we find significant discrepancies for rovibrational processes involving highly-excited rotational and vibrational states. We attribute these differences to two key factors: the broader range of intramolecular distances covered by ab initio points, and the superior accuracy of the PES, resulting from the utilization of the state-of-the-art quantum chemistry methods, compared to the previous lower-level calculations. Radiative transfer calculations performed with the new collisional data indicate that the population of rotational levels in excited vibrational states experiences significant modifications, highlighting the critical need for this updated dataset in models of high-temperature astrophysical environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We have observed the Didymos-Dimorphos binary system with the MUSE integral field unit spectrograph mounted at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) pre and post-DART impact, and captured the ensuing ejecta cone, debris cloud, and tails at sub-arcsecond resolutions. We targeted the Didymos system over 11 nights from 26 September to 25 October 2022, and utilized both narrow and wide-field observations with and without adaptive optics, respectively. We took advantage of the spectral-spatial coupled measurements and produced both white-light images and spectral maps of the dust reflectance. We identified and characterized numerous dust features, such as the ejecta cone, spirals, wings, clumps, and tails. We found that the base of the Sunward edge of the wings, from 03 to 19 October, consistent with maximum grain sizes on the order of 0.05-0.2 mm, and that the earliest detected clumps have the highest velocities on the order of 10 m/s. We also see that three clumps in narrow-field mode (8x8'') exhibit redder colors and slower speeds, around 0.09 m/s, than the surrounding ejecta, likely indicating that the clump is comprised of larger, slower grains. We measured the properties of the primary tail, and resolved and measured the properties of the secondary tail earlier than any other published study, with first retrieval on 03 October. Both tails exhibit similarities in curvature and relative flux, however, the secondary tail appears thinner, which may be caused by lower energy ejecta and possibly a low energy formation mechanism such as secondary impacts.
#### On the evolution of Betti curves in the Cosmic web

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10029
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.10029
 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we study the evolution of Betti curves obtained by persistent-homological analysis of pointclouds formed by halos in different cosmological $N$-body simulations. We show that they can be approximated with a scaled log-normal distribution function with reasonable precision. Our analysis shows that the shapes and maximums of Betti curves exhibit dependence on the mass range of the selected subpopulation of halos, but at the same time, the resolution of a simulation does not play any significant role, provided that the mass distribution of simulated halos is complete down to a given mass scale. Besides, we study how Betti curves change with the evolution of the Universe, i.e., their dependence on redshift. Sampling subpopulations of halos within certain mass ranges up to redshift $z=2.5$ yields a surprisingly small difference between corresponding Betti curves. We propose that this may be an indicator of the existence of a new specific topological invariant in the structure of the Universe.
#### On the potential of Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor stars for Galactic  Archaeology

 - **Abstract**
 The low-mass metal-poor stars in the Galaxy that preserve in their atmosphere, the chemical imprints of the gas clouds from which they were formed can be used as probes to get insight into the origin and evolution of elements in the early galaxy, early star formation and nucleosynthesis. Among the metal-poor stars, a large fraction, the so-called carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars exhibits high abundance of carbon. These stars exhibit diverse abundance patterns, particularly for heavy elements, based on which they are classified into different groups. The diversity of abundance patterns points at different formation scenarios. Hence, accurate classification of CEMP stars and knowledge of their distribution is essential to understand the role and contribution of each group. While CEMP-s and CEMP-r/s stars can be used to get insight into binary interactions at very low metallicity, CEMP-no stars can be used to probe the properties of the first stars and early nucleosynthesis. To exploit the full potential of CEMP stars for Galactic archaeology a homogeneous analysis of each class is extremely important. Our efforts towards, and contributions to providing an improved classification scheme for accurate classification of CEMP-s and CEMP-r/s stars and in characterizing the companion asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of CH, CEMP-no, CEMP-s and CEMP-r/s binary systems are discussed. Some recent results obtained based on low- and high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of a large number of potential CH and CEMP star candidates are highlighted.
