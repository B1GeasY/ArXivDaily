#### Modeling molecular hydrogen in low metallicity galaxies
 - **Authors:** Ava Polzin, Andrey V. Kravtsov, Vadim A. Semenov, Nickolay Y. Gnedin
 - **Subjects:** Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)

 - **Abstract**
 We use a suite of hydrodynamics simulations of the interstellar medium (ISM) within a galactic disk, which include radiative transfer, a non-equilibrium model of molecular hydrogen, and a realistic model for star formation and feedback, to study the structure of the ISM and H$_2$ abundance as a function of local ISM properties. We show that the star formation rate and structure of the ISM are sensitive to the metallicity of the gas with a progressively smoother density distribution with decreasing metallicity. In addition to the well-known trend of the HI-H$_2$ transition shifting to higher densities with decreasing metallicity, the maximum achieved molecular fraction in the interstellar medium drops drastically at $Z \lesssim 0.2 \, Z_\odot$ as the formation time of H$_2$ becomes much longer than a typical lifetime of dense regions of the ISM. We present accurate fitting formulae for both volumetric and projected $f_\mathrm{H_2}$ measured on different scales as a function of gas metallicity, UV radiation field, and gas density. We show that when the formulae are applied to the patches in the simulated galaxy the overall molecular gas mass is reproduced to better than a factor of $\lesssim 1.5$ across the entire range of metallicities and scales. We also show that the presented fit is considerably more accurate than any of the previous $f_\mathrm{H_2}$ models and fitting formulae in the low-metallicity regime. The fit can thus be used for modeling molecular gas in low-resolution simulations and semi-analytic models of galaxy formation in the dwarf and high-redshift regimes.
#### Low-energy Explosions in a Gravitational Field: Implications for  Sub-energetic Supernovae and Fast X-ray Transients
 - **Authors:** Daniel A. Paradiso, Eric R. Coughlin, Jonathan Zrake, Dheeraj R. Pasham

 - **Abstract**
 Observations and theory suggest that core-collapse supernovae can span a range of explosion energies, and when sub-energetic, the shockwave initiating the explosion can decelerate to speeds comparable to the escape speed of the progenitor. In these cases, gravity will complicate the explosion hydrodynamics and conceivably cause the shock to stall at large radii within the progenitor star. To understand these unique properties of weak explosions, we develop a perturbative approach for modeling the propagation of an initially strong shock into a time-steady, infalling medium in the gravitational field of a compact object. This method writes the shock position and the post-shock velocity, density, and pressure as series solutions in the (time-dependent) ratio of the freefall speed to the shock speed, and predicts that the shock stalls within the progenitor if the explosion energy is below a critical value. We show that our model agrees very well with hydrodynamic simulations, and accurately predicts (e.g.) the time-dependent shock position and velocity and the radius at which the shock stalls. Our results have implications for black hole formation and the newly detected class of fast X-ray transients (FXTs). In particular, we propose that a ``phantom shock breakout'' -- where the outer edge of the star falls through a stalled shock -- can yield a burst of X-rays without a subsequent optical/UV signature, similar to FXTs. This model predicts the rise time of the X-ray burst, $t_{\rm d}$, and the mean photon energy, $kT$, are anti-correlated, approximately as $T \propto t_{\rm d}^{-5/8}$.
#### Population III star formation: multiple gas phases prevent the use of an  equation of state at high densities

 - **Abstract**
 Advanced primordial chemistry networks have been developed to model the collapse of metal-free baryonic gas within the gravitational well of dark matter (DM) halos and its subsequent collapse into Population III stars. At the low densities of 10^-26-10^-21 g cm-3 (10-3-10^2 cm-3) the collapse is dependent on H2 production, which is a function of the compressional heating provided by the DM potential. Once the gas decouples from the DM, the temperature-density relationship follows a well established path dictated by various chemical reactions until the formation of the protostar at 10^-4 g cm-3 (10^19 cm-3). Here we explore the feasibility of replacing the chemical network (CN) with a barotropic equation of state (EoS) just before the formation of the first protostar, to reduce the computational load of simulating the further fragmentation, evolution and characteristics of the very high density gas. We find a significant reduction in fragmentation when using the EoS. The EoS method produces a protostellar mass distribution that peaks at higher masses when compared to CN runs. The change in fragmentation behaviour is due to a lack of cold gas falling in through the disc around the first protostar when using an EoS. Despite this, the total mass accreted across all sinks was invariant to the switch to an EoS, hence the star formation rate (Msun yr^-1) is accurately predicted using an EoS. The EoS routine is approximately 4000 times faster than the CN, however this numerical gain is offset by the lack of accuracy in modelling secondary protostar formation and hence its use must be considered carefully.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) Electron-molecule interaction is a fundamental process in radiation-driven chemistry in space, from the interstellar medium to comets. Therefore, knowledge of interaction cross-sections is key. While there has been a plethora of studies of total ionization cross-sections, data is often spread over many sources, or not public or readily available. We introduce the Astrochemistry Low-energy Electron Cross-Section (ALeCS) database, a public database for electron interaction cross-sections and ionization rates for molecules of astrochemical interest. In this work, we present the first data release comprising total ionization cross-sections and ionization rates for over 200 neutral molecules. We include optimized geometries and molecular orbital energies at various levels of theory, and for a subset of the molecules, the ionization potentials. We compute total ionization cross-sections using the binary-encounter Bethe model and screening-corrected additivity rule, and ionization rates and reaction network coefficients for molecular cloud environments for $>$200 neutral molecules ranging from diatomics to complex organics. We demonstrate that our binary-encounter Bethe cross-sections agree well with experimental data. We show that the ionization rates scale roughly linearly with the number of constituent atoms in the molecule. We introduce and describe the public ALeCS database. For the initial release, we include total ionization cross-sections for $>$200 neutral molecules and several cations and anions calculated with different levels of quantum chemistry theory, the chemical reaction rates for the ionization, and network files in the formats of the two most popular astrochemical networks, the KIDA and UMIST. The database will be continuously updated for more molecules and interactions.
#### Shocking Sgr B2(N1) with its own outflow: A new perspective on  segregation between O- and N-bearing molecules
 - **Authors:** Laura A. Busch, Arnaud Belloche, Robin T. Garrod, Holger S. P. Mueller, Karl M. Menten

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11339
 - **Abstract**
 We want to investigate the influence of the powerful outflow driven by the hot core Sgr B2(N1) on the gas molecular inventory of the surrounding medium. We used the data taken as part of the 3 mm imaging spectral-line survey ReMoCA (Re-exploring Molecular Complexity with ALMA). Integrated intensity maps of SO and SiO emission reveal a bipolar structure with blue-shifted emission dominantly extending to the SE from the centre of the hot core and red-shifted emission to the NW. This is also prominently observed in emission of other S-bearing molecules and species that only contain N as a heavy element, including COMs, but also CH3OH, CH3CHO, HNCO, and NH2CHO. For a selection of COMs and simpler species, spectra were modelled under the assumption of LTE and population diagrams were derived at two positions, one in each outflow lobe. From this analysis, we obtained rotational temperatures, which are in a range of ~100-200K, and column densities. Abundances were subsequently compared to predictions of astrochemical models and to observations of L1157-B1, a position located in the well-studied outflow of the low-mass protostar L1157, and the source G+0.693-0.027, located in the Sgr B2 molecular cloud complex. Given the short distance of the analysed outflow positions to the centre of Sgr B2(N1), we propose a scenario in which a phase of hot-core chemistry (i.e. thermal desorption of ice species and high-temperature gas-phase chemistry) preceded a shock wave. The subsequent compression and further heating of the material resulted in the accelerated destruction of (mainly O-bearing) molecules. Gas-phase formation of cyanides seems to be able to compete with their destruction in the post-shock gas. Abundances of HCnN (n=3,5) are enhanced in the outflow component pointing to (additional) gas-phase formation. To confirm such a scenario, appropriate chemical shock models need to be run.
