#### Spin-Orbit Alignment of Early-type Astrometric Binaries and the Origin of Slow Rotators

 - **Abstract**
 The spin-orbit alignment of binary stars traces their formation and accretion history. Previous studies of spin-orbit alignment have been limited to small samples, slowly rotating solar-type stars, and/or wide visual binaries that not surprisingly manifest random spin-orbit orientations. We analyze 917 Gaia astrometric binaries across periods $P$ = 100-3,000 days ($a$ = 0.5-5 au) that have B8-F1 IV/V primaries ($M_1$ = 1.5-3 M$_{\odot}$) and measured projected rotational velocities $v$sin$i$. The primary stars in face-on orbits exhibit substantially smaller $v$sin$i$ compared to those in edge-on orbits at the 6$\sigma$ level, demonstrating significant spin-orbit alignment. The primaries in our astrometric binaries are rotating more slowly than their single-star or wide-binary counterparts and therefore comprise the slow-rotator population in the observed bimodal rotational velocity distribution of early-type stars. We discuss formation models of close binaries where some of the disk angular momentum is transferred to the orbit and/or secondary spin, quenching angular momentum flow to the primary spin. The primaries in astrometric binaries with small mass ratios $q$ = $M_2$/$M_1<$0.3 possess even smaller $v$sin$i$, consistent with model predictions. Meanwhile, astrometric binaries with large eccentricities $e>$0.4 do not display spin-orbit alignment or spin reduction. Using a Monte Carlo technique, we measure a spin-orbit alignment fraction of $F_{\rm align}$ = 75% $\pm$ 5% and an average spin reduction factor of $\langle S_{\rm align} \rangle$ = 0.43 $\pm$ 0.04. We conclude that 75% of close A-type binaries likely experienced circumbinary disk accretion and probably formed via disk fragmentation and inward disk migration. The remaining 25%, mostly those with $e>$0.4, likely formed via core fragmentation and orbital decay via dynamical friction.

 - **Abstract**
 Our objective is to investigate the distribution of dust and associated large-scale structures of the Galaxy using optical linear polarization measurements of various open clusters located at different distances in the Galactic anticenter direction. We present R-band linear polarization observations of stars towards five open clusters: Kronberger~1, Berkeley~69, Berkeley~71, Berkeley~19, and King~8 in the anticenter direction. The polarization observations were carried out using AIMPOL instrument mounted on the 104 cm Sampurnanand telescope of ARIES, Nainital, making it the first study to target the polarization observations towards distant clusters ($\sim$6~kpc). We combined the observed polarization data with the distance information from the Gaia space telescope to infer the dust distribution along the line of sight. The variation in the degree of polarization and extinction with distance reveals the presence of multiple dust layers along each cluster direction. In addition, common foreground dust layers detected towards different cluster directions highlight the presence of global features such as spiral arms. Our results show that the dust clouds at 2~kpc towards Berkeley~69 and Berkeley~71 coincide with the Perseus arm, while the dust layer at $\sim$4~kpc towards distant clusters, Berkeley~19 and King~8, indicates the presence of the Outer arm. The large-scale dust distribution obtained by combining our polarization results with the previous polarization studies of nearby open clusters suggests that the anticenter direction is characterized by low extinction, homogeneous dust distribution with somewhat uniform orientation of the plane-of-sky component of the magnetic field along the line of sight. Our study demonstrates the utility of polarization as a tool to study the large-scale dust distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 Cygnus X-1 is a high mass X-ray binary where accretion onto the black hole is mediated by the stellar wind from the blue supergiant companion star HDE 226868. Depending on the position of the black hole along the orbit, X-ray observations can probe different layers of the stellar wind. Deeper wind layers can be investigated at superior conjunction (i.e. null orbital phases). We aim at characterising the stellar wind in the Cyg X-1/HDE 226868 system analysing one passage at superior conjunction covered by XMM-Newton during the CHOCBOX campaign via modelling of colour-colour diagrams. Since X-ray absorption is energy-dependent, colour indices provide information on the parameters of the stellar wind, such as the column density $N_{H,w}$ and the covering factor $f_c$. We fitted colour-colour diagrams with models that include both a continuum and a stellar wind component. We used the KDE method to infer the unknown probability distribution of the data points in the colour-colour diagram, and selected the model corresponding to the highest likelihood. In order to study the temporal evolution of the wind around superior conjunction, we extracted and fitted time-resolved colour-colour diagrams. We found that the model that best describes the shape of the colour-colour diagram of Cyg X-1 at superior conjunction requires the wind to be partially ionised. The shape of the colour-colour diagram strongly varies during the analysed observation, as due to concurrent changes of the mean $N_{H,w}$ and the $f_c$ of the wind. Our results suggest the existence of a linear scaling between the rapid variability amplitude of $N_{H,w}$ (on time scales between 10 s and 11 ks) and its long term variations (on time scales 11>ks). Using the inferred best-fit values, we estimated the stellar mass loss rate to be $\sim 7\times10^{-6} {\rm M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$ and the clumps to have a mass of $\sim10^{17}$ g.
#### Study of a red clump giant, KIC~11087027, with high rotation and strong infrared excess -- Evidence of tidal interaction for high lithium abundance

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents results from Kepler photometric light curves and high-resolution spectroscopic study of a super Li-rich giant KIC11087027. Using the light curve analysis, we measured the star's rotational period P$_{\rm rot}$=30.4$\pm$0.1~days, which translates to rotational velocity V$_{\rm rot}$=19.5 $\pm$ 1.7~km s$^{-1}$. Star's location in the HR-diagram, derived values of $^{12}C/^{13}C$ = 7$\pm$1 and $[C/N]=-0.95\pm 0.2$, and the inferred asteroseismic parameters from secondary calibration based on spectra suggest star is a low-mass red clump giant in the He-core burning phase. Using Gaia data, we found evidence of variation in radial velocity and proper motion, indicative of presence of an unresolved binary. The large V$_{\rm rot}$ is probably a result of tidal synchronization combined with the after-effects of He-flash, in which the size of the star is reduced significantly. The simultaneous presence of features like high rotation, very high Li abundance, strong dust shell, and strong flares in a single star is relatively uncommon, suggesting that the star experiencing tidal synchronization has recently undergone He-flash. The results pose a question whether the binary interaction, hence the high rotation, is a prerequisite for dredging-up of the high amounts of Li from the interior to the photosphere during or immediately after the He-flash event.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar molecules, which play an important role in astrochemistry, are identified using observed spectral lines. Despite the advent of spectral analysis tools in the past decade, the identification of spectral lines remains a tedious task that requires extensive manual intervention, preventing us from fully exploiting the vast amounts of data generated by large facilities such as ALMA. This study aims to address the aforementioned issue by developing a framework of automated line identification. We introduce a robust spectral fitting technique applicable for spectral line identification with minimal human supervision. Our method is assessed using published data from five line surveys of hot cores, including W51, Orion-KL, Sgr B2(M), and Sgr B2(N). By comparing the identified lines, our algorithm achieves a recall of ~ 84% - 98%. Our code, named Spectuner, is publicly available on GitHub.
#### Mode identification and ensemble asteroseismology of 164 \beta Cep stars discovered from Gaia light curves and monitored by TESS

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia mission discovered many new candidate \beta Cephei (\beta Cep) pulsators, which are meanwhile confirmed from TESS space photometry. We aim to analyse all currently available TESS data for these \beta Cep pulsators, of which 145 were new discoveries, in order to exploit their asteroseismic potential. \beta Cep stars belong to an under-represented class of pulsators in the current space photometry revolution while being of critical importance to improve evolution models of massive stars. We extracted light curves for 216 star from the TESS full-frame images and performed pre-whitening. Based on Gaia DR3, we deduced stellar properties and compared them to those of known \beta Cep stars. We developed a methodology to identify the dominant pulsation modes of the \beta Cep stars from Gaia and TESS amplitude ratios and from the detection of rotationally-split multiplets. We used grid modelling to gain insights into the population of \beta Cep stars. With the combination of TESS and Gaia, we successfully identified the mode degrees for 176 stars. of which the majority are dipole non-radial modes. Many non-radial modes show splittings in their TESS frequency spectra allowing us to assemble a large set of split multiplets in \beta Cep stars and to calculate their envelope rotation, spin parameter, and the level of differential envelope-to-surface rotation. For the latter, we find an upper limit of 4, with most stars rotating almost rigidly. We also provide the asymmetries of the multiplets. Based on grid modelling, we provide mass, convective core mass, and ages for 164 stars. By combining Gaia and TESS, we enable asteroseismology of \beta Cep stars as a population. Our study prepares for future detailed modelling based on individual frequencies of identified modes leading towards a better understanding of these massive pulsators, as crucial probes of stellar evolution theory.

#### Two radio cores in GPS J1543-0757: a new dual supermassive black hole system?

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the discovery of a dual supermassive black hole system in the radio galaxy J1543-0757, with a projected separation between the two black holes of 46 mas. The result is based on recent multifrequency observations using the Very Long Baseline Array and European VLBI Network, which reveal two compact, variable, flat-spectrum, active nuclei within the elliptical host galaxy of J1543-0757. Multiepoch observations from the VLBA also provide constraints on the spectral index and proper motions of all components. The flat spectra of both N and S at both frequencies strongly support that these radio components are associated with two separate, accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The two nuclei appear stationary, while the jets emanating from the weaker of the two nuclei appear to move out and terminate in bright hot spots. The discovery of this system has implications for the number of close dual black holes that might be sources of gravitational radiation.
#### Modeling parity-violating spectra in Galactic dust polarization with filaments and its applications to cosmic birefringence searches

 - **Abstract**
 We extend the dust-filament-based model presented in Hervías-Caimapo & Huffenberger 2022 to produce parity-violating foreground spectra by manipulating the filament orientations relative to the magnetic field. We calibrate our model to observations of the misalignment angle using cross-correlations of Planck and HI 21-cm line data, producing a fiducial model that predicts a $\mathcal{D}_{\ell}^{EB}\sim$few $\mu$K$^2$ dust signal at 353 GHz and where $\sim 56$% of filaments have a positive misalignment angle. The main purpose of this model is to be used as dust with non-zero parity-violating emission in forecasting a measurement of cosmic birefringence by upcoming experiments. Here, we also use our fiducial model to assess the impact of dust in measurements of the isotropic cosmic birefringence angle $\beta$ with Planck data by measuring the misalignment angle as a function of scale, as well as directly using our model's $\mathcal{D}_{\ell}^{EB}$ prediction as a template. In both cases, we measure $\beta$ to be consistent within $0.83\sigma$ of the equivalent measurements with Planck data and its derivatives.

 - **Abstract**
 Many circumbinary gas giant planets have been recently discovered. The formation mechanism of circumbinary planets on wide orbits is unclear. We investigate the formation of Delorme 1 (AB)b, a 13$\pm$5M$_{\rm J}$ planet, orbiting its host binary at 84AU. The planet is accreting while having an estimated age of 40Myr, which is unexpected, as this process should have ceased due to the dissipation of the protoplanetary disc. Using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code SEREN, we model three formation scenarios for this planet. In Scenario I the planet forms in-situ on a wide orbit in a massive disc (by gravitational instability), in Scenario II closer to the binary in a massive disc (by gravitational instability), and in Scenario III much closer to the binary in a less massive disc (by core accretion). Planets in Scenario I stay at the observed separation, have mass accretion rates consistent with observed value, but their final mass is too high. In Scenario II, the planet reaches the observed separation through outward migration or scattering by the binary, and has mass accretion rate comparable to the observed; however, the planet mass is above the observed value. In Scenario III, the planet's final mass and mass accretion rate are comparable to the observed ones but the planet's separation is smaller. We conclude that all models may explain some features of the observations but not all of them, raising questions about how gas is accreted onto the planet from its circumplanetary disc, and of the presumed age of the system.
#### PDRs4All. X. ALMA and JWST detection of neutral carbon in the externally irradiated disk d203-506: Undepleted gas-phase carbon

 - **Abstract**
 The gas-phase abundance of carbon, x_C = C/H, and its depletion factors are essential parameters for understanding the gas and solid compositions that are ultimately incorporated into planets. The majority of protoplanetary disks are born in clusters and, as a result, are exposed to external FUV radiation. These FUV photons potentially affect the disk's evolution, chemical composition, and line excitation. We present the first detection of the [CI]609um fine-structure line of neutral carbon (CI), achieved with ALMA, toward one of these disks, d203-506, in the Orion Nebula Cluster. We also report the detection of CI forbidden and permitted lines (from electronically excited states up to 10 eV) observed with JWST in the IR. These lines trace the irradiated outer disk and photo-evaporative wind. Contrary to the common belief that these IR lines are C+ recombination lines, we find that they are dominated by FUV-pumping of CI followed by fluorescence cascades. They trace the transition from atomic to molecular gas, and their intensities scale with G0. The lack of outstanding IR OI fluorescent emission, however, implies a sharper attenuation of external FUV radiation with E > 12 eV (~Lyman-beta). This is related to a lower effective FUV dust absorption cross section compared to that of interstellar grains, implying a more prominent role for FUV shielding by the CI photoionization continuum. The [CI]609um intensity is proportional to N(CI) and can be used to infer x_C. We derive x_C ~ 1.4E-4. This implies that there is no major depletion of volatile carbon compared to x_C measured in the natal cloud, hinting at a young disk. We also show that external FUV radiation impacts the outer disk and wind by vertically shifting the water freeze-out depth, which results in less efficient grain growth and settling. This shift leads to nearly solar gas-phase C/O abundance ratios in these irradiated layers.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a systematic analysis of the early multi-band light curves and colors of 19 Type Ia Supernovae (SNe) from the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network SN Program, including 16 previously unpublished events. Seven are detected $\lesssim$ 1 day since the estimated epoch of first light and the rest within $\lesssim$ 3 days. Some show excess emission within $<$ 0.5 days to $\sim$ 2 days, but most show pure power-law rises. The colors are initially diverse before $\sim$ 5 days, but converge to a similar color at $\sim$ 10 days. We identify at least three populations based on 2--5-day color evolution: (1) "early-blues" exhibit slowly-evolving colors consistent with a $\sim$ 17,000 K blackbody; (2) "early-reds" have initially blue $B-V$ and red $V-i$ colors that cannot simultaneously be fit with a blackbody -- likely due to suppression of $B$- and $i$-band flux by Fe II/III and Ca II -- and evolve more rapidly; and (3) "early-yellows" evolve blueward, consistent with thermal heating from $\sim$ 8,000 to 13,000 K. The distributions of early-blue and early-red colors are compatible with them being either distinct populations -- with early-reds comprising (60 $\pm$ 15)% of them -- or extreme ends of one continuous population; whereas the early-yellow population identified here is clearly distinct. Compared to the other populations, early-blues in our sample differ by exhibiting excess emission within 1--2 days, nearly constant peak brightness regardless of $\Delta M_{15}(B)$ after standardization, and shallower Si II features. Early-blues also prefer star-forming host environments, while early-yellows and, to a lesser extent, early-reds prefer quiescent ones. These preferences appear to indicate at least two Type Ia SN production channels based on stellar population age, while early-reds and early-blues may still share a common origin.

 - **Abstract**
 The Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES) constitutes a mission intricately designed to systematically survey approximately 100 solar-type stars located within the immediate proximity of the solar system, specifically within a range of 10 parsecs. The core objective of this mission is the detection and characterization of potentially habitable Earth-like planets or super-Earths within the habitable zone of these stars. The CHES mission obtains high-precision astrometric measurements of planets orbiting the target stars by observing angular distance variations between the target star and reference stars. As a result, we surveyed the relevant parameters of both target and reference stars in detail, conducting a thorough analysis and calculation of the required observation accuracy, the number of observations, and the priority assigned to each target star. Observational emphasis will be concentrated on targets considered of higher priority, ensuring the effectiveness of their observation capabilities. Through this approach, we formulate a five-year observation strategy that will cover all the target stars within a six-month timeframe. The strategy not only fulfills the required observing capability but also exhibit high efficiency simultaneously, providing an executable program for future mission. Over the span of the mission's five-year duration, a cumulative observation time of 29,220 hours will be available. Approximately 86 percent of this, totaling 25,120 hours, is allocated for the observation of target stars. This allocation leaves approximately 4,100 hours for extended scientific observation programs. We have also performed simulated observations based on this strategy and verified its observational capability for exoplanets.
