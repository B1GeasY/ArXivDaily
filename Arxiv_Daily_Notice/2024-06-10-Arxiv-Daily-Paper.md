 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter makes up approximately 85% of total matter in our universe, yet it has never been directly observed in any laboratory on Earth. The origin of dark matter is one of the most important questions in contemporary physics, and a convincing detection of dark matter would be a Nobel-Prize-level breakthrough in fundamental science. The ABRACADABRA experiment was specifically designed to search for dark matter. Although it has not yet made a discovery, ABRACADABRA has produced several dark matter search results widely endorsed by the physics community. The experiment generates ultra-long time-series data at a rate of 10 million samples per second, where the dark matter signal would manifest itself as a sinusoidal oscillation mode within the ultra-long time series. In this paper, we present the TIDMAD -- a comprehensive data release from the ABRACADABRA experiment including three key components: an ultra-long time series dataset divided into training, validation, and science subsets; a carefully-designed denoising score for direct model benchmarking; and a complete analysis framework which produces a community-standard dark matter search result suitable for publication as a physics paper. This data release enables core AI algorithms to extract the signal and produce real physics results thereby advancing fundamental science.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of our Galaxy's high-velocity clouds (HVCs) remains a mystery after many decades of effort. In this paper, we use the TNG50 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project to identify cool, dense clouds that match observations of Galactic HVCs. We track these clouds back in time to determine their origin. We find that only 17% of HVCs (by mass) can be tracked directly to the disk, and 21% to satellite accretion. The majority of HVCs (62%) arise from warm and hot circumgalactic gas that cools through thermal instability. They then obtain their anomalous velocities through interactions with the turbulent circumgalactic medium. At TNG50 resolution, we do not see evidence for HVCs forming out of very low metallicity intergalactic material. Instead, low metallicity HVCs are most likely associated with satellite accretion. These results suggest that Galactic HVCs are highly heterogeneous in their origin, and can provide insight into the physical processes that shape the circumgalactic medium such as disk outflows, satellite accretion, and thermal instabilities.
#### Detection of 49 Weak Dispersed Radio Pulses in a Parkes Observation of the X-ray Pulsar PSR J0537$-$6910

 - **Abstract**
 I conducted a new search for dispersed radio pulses from the X-ray pulsar PSR J0537$-$6910 in the Large Magellanic Cloud in a long (11.6 hr) archival 1.4 GHz Parkes search observation. I searched dispersion measures (DMs) between 0 and 10000 pc cm$^{-3}$ and detected 49 pulses with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) greater than 7 at a wide range of DMs using the HEIMDALL and FETCH pulse detection and classification packages. All of the pulses were weak, with none having a S/N above 8.5. There was a significant excess of pulses observed in the DM range of the known pulsar population in the LMC, suggesting that these pulses may originate from LMC pulsars. Three repeat pulses, each having widths $\lesssim 1$ ms, were detected in a single DM trial of 103.412 pc cm$^{-3}$, which is in the LMC DM range. This is unlikely to occur by chance in a single DM trial in this search at the (marginally significant) 4.3$\sigma$ level. It remains unclear whether any of the detected pulses in the sample are from PSR J0537$-$6910 itself.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent hydrodynamical simulations of the late stages of supernova remnant (SNR) evolution have revealed that as they merge with the ambient medium, SNRs implode, leading to the formation of dense clouds in their center. While being highly chemically enriched by their host SNR, these clouds appear to have similar properties as giant molecular clouds, which are believed to be the main site of star formation. Here, we develop a simple model, in order to estimate the efficiency of the star formation that might be triggered by the implosion of SNRs. We separately consider two cases, cyclic star formation, maintained by the episodic driving of feedback from new generations of stars; and a single burst of star formation, triggered by a single explosion. We find that in the cyclic case, star formation is inefficient, with implosion-triggered star-formation contributing a few percent of the observed star-formation efficiency per free-fall timescale. In the single-burst case, higher star-formation efficiencies can be obtained. However, while the implosion-triggered process might not contribute much to the overall star-formation, due to the high chemical enrichment of the birth clouds, it can explain the formation of a significant fraction of metal-rich stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Time-domain and multimessenger astronomy (TDAMM) involves the study of transient and time-variable phenomena across various wavelengths and messengers. The Astro2020 Decadal Survey has identified TDAMM as the top priority for NASA in this decade, emphasizing its crucial role in advancing our understanding of the universe and driving new discoveries in astrophysics. The TDAMM community has come together to provide further guidance to funding agencies, aiming to define a clear path toward optimizing scientific returns in this research domain. This encompasses not only astronomy but also fundamental physics, offering insights into gravity properties, the formation of heavy elements, the equation of state of dense matter, and quantum effects associated with extreme magnetic fields. Magnetars, neutron stars with the strongest magnetic fields known in the universe, play a critical role in this context. In this manuscript, we aim to underscore the significance of magnetars in TDAMM, highlighting the necessity of ensuring observational continuity, addressing current limitations, and outlining essential requirements to expand our knowledge in this field.
#### Unraveling Trace Anomaly of Supradense Matter via Neutron Star Compactness Scaling

 - **Abstract**
 The trace anomaly $\Delta\equiv 1/3-P/\varepsilon$ quantifies the possibly broken conformal symmetry in supradense matter under pressure $P$ at energy density $\varepsilon$. Perturbative QCD (pQCD) predicts a vanishing $\Delta$ at extremely high energy or baryon densities when the conformal symmetry is realized but its behavior at intermediate densities reachable in neutron stars (NSs) are still very uncertain. The extraction of $\Delta$ from NS observations strongly depends on the employed model for nuclear Equation of State (EOS). Based on the analytical results from perturbatively analyzing the dimensionless Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations that are further verified numerically by using $10^5$ EOSs generated randomly with a meta-model in a very broad EOS parameter space constrained by terrestrial nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations, here we first show that the compactness $\xi\equiv M_{\rm{NS}}/R$ of a NS with mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$ and radius $R$ scales very accurately with $\Pi_{\rm{c}}\equiv\mathrm{X}/(1+3\mathrm{X}^2+4\mathrm{X})$ where $\mathrm{X}\equiv P_{\rm{c}}/\varepsilon_{\rm{c}}$ is the ratio of pressure over energy density at NS centers. The scaling of NS compactness thus enables one to readily read off the central trace anomaly $\Delta_{\rm{c}}=1/3-\mathrm{X}$ directly from the observational data of either the mass-radius or red-shift measurements. We then demonstrate indeed that the available NS data themselves from recent X-ray and gravitational wave observations can determine model-independently the trace anomaly as a function of energy density in NS cores, providing a stringent test of existing NS models and a clear guidance in a new direction for further understanding the nature and EOS of supradense matter.
#### Searching for stellar population in the molecular cloud GRSMC 045.49+00.04

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the characteristics of young stellar populations is essential for deriving insights into star formation processes within parent molecular clouds and the influence of massive stars. This study focuses on YSOs in the G 045.49+00.04 molecular cloud, including three UC HII regions. Using infrared photometric data and radiation models, we identified 1482 YSOs with masses ranging from 1.5 to 22 Msol. Among these, 315 form dense clusters near IRAS sources, with high-mass stars responsible for ionization. The non-cluster YSOs (1168) are uniformly distributed on the field. The distribution of YSOs from both samples on the colour-magnitude diagram and by the evolutionary ages is different. About 75% of objects in the IRAS clusters are concentrated around the ZAMS and have a well-defined peak at an age of Log(Age[years]) = 6.75, with a narrow spread. The non-cluster objects have two concentrations located to the right and left of the 0.1 Myr isochrone and two well-defined peaks at Log(Age) = 6.25 and 5.25. The K luminosity functions alpha slopes for the IRAS clusters and non-cluster objects are 0.32 and 0.72, respectively. The steeper alpha slope is suggesting that the non-cluster objects are less evolved, which is well consistent with the evolutionary age. Similar patterns were observed in the neighboring G 45.14+00.14 region. The both regions (G 045.49+00.04 and G 45.14+00.14) are located and distinguished by their brightness and density at the edge of the bubble around the highly variable X-ray binary GRS 1915+105, which includes a black hole and a K-giant companion. Based on the above, we can assume that the process of star formation in the young IRAS clusters was triggered by the GRS 915+105-initiated shock front inside the ISM massive condensation, through the process of "collecting and collapse". Most non-cluster objects probably belong to a later generation.
#### UVIT Study of the MAgellanic Clouds (U-SMAC) I. Recent star formation history and kinematics of the Shell region in the North-Eastern Small Magellanic Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 The interactions between the Magellanic Clouds significantly affect the shape and distribution of the young stellar population, particularly in the periphery of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We present the first far-UV (FUV) map of the north-east SMC-Shell region using the Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat. The detected FUV stars are combined with Gaia Early Data Release 3 data to create a FUV-optical catalog of ~ 14,400 stars. FUV-optical colour-magnitude diagrams are used along with isochrones to estimate the stellar ages. The detected stars are formed in multiple episodes. We identified two episodes of star formation (~ 60 and ~ 260 Myr ago) where the episode at ~ 260 Myr is linked to the recent interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the episode at ~ 60 Myr is linked to the pericentric passage of the SMC around our Galaxy. The median proper motion (PM) and velocity dispersion are found to be similar to the SMC main body, indicating that this region has not experienced significant tidal effects. The FUV stellar surface density and the dispersion in PM suggest an extent of the inner SMC in the north-east direction to be around 2.2 deg. We detect arm-like and arc-like structures in the FUV stellar density map, and their kinematics appear to be similar to the SMC main body. These extended outer features are the spatial stellar overdensities formed over multiple episodes of star formation, but without apparent kinematic distinction.
