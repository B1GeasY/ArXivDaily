 - **Abstract**
 This is the second paper in a series, which studies the likelihood that some globular clusters (GCs) of the Milky Way (MW) could have originated from a dwarf satellite galaxy (DSG). Using a large suite of three-body simulations we determine the present-day orbital properties of 154 GCs that could have escaped from 41 MW DSGs over the past $8\,\mathrm{Gyrs}$. For the MW we considered two sets of static and dynamic models which account for the sustained growth of the MW since its birth. We focus on the Magellanic Clouds and Sagittarius. We compare the apogalactic distance, eccentricity, and orbital inclination of the MW GCs with those of runaway GCs from DSGs, to constrain their possible ex-situ origin. We observe a positive correlation between a DSG mass and the dispersion of its runaway GCs in the orbital parameter space of ($R_\mathrm{ap}$, $e$). We provide tables of the identified MW GCs and their likely associated progenitors. In total, we find 29 (19%) MW GCs which could be kinematically associated with MW DSGs. We report, for the first time, 6 and 10 new associations with the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Sagittarius, respectively. For the Sagittarius we predict a concentration of runaway GCs at large apogalactic distances of $R_\mathrm{ap}\approx275-375\,\mathrm{kpc}$, $e\approx0.8$, and a relative inclination of $\Delta\theta\approx20^{\circ}$. So far, there has not been any observed GCs with such orbital elements. Complemented with photometric and spectroscopic observations, and cosmological simulations, the findings from the present study could conclusively settle the debate over the in-situ vs. ex-situ origin of the MW GCs.

 - **Abstract**
 Streaming instability is considered to be one of the dominant processes to promote planetesimal formation by gravitational collapse of dust clumps. The development of streaming instability is expected to form dust clumps in which the local dust density is strongly enhanced and even greater than the Roche density. The resulting clumps can collapse to form planetesimals. Recent simulations conducted long-term simulations and showed that such strong clumping occurs in a wider parameter space than previously expected. However, the indicated timescale for strong clumping can be on the order of tens to hundreds Keplerian periods. In this paper, we estimate the growth time of dust grains during the pre-clumping phase. We find that the dust growth considerably proceeds before the strong clumping because even the moderate clumping due to streaming instability increases the local dust-to-gas ratio $\gtrsim10$. Depending on the gas sound speed, the dust collision velocity can be kept below $\sim 1\;\mathrm{m/s}$ once sufficiently strong dust clumping occurs. Thus, even silicate grains might have the potential to grow safely toward the size whose Stokes number is unity during the clumping. Our results demonstrate the importance of local dust coagulation during the dust clumping due to streaming instability.

 - **Abstract**
 A multi-parameter analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of meteorological parameters, night sky brightness and seismic hazard on proposed sites for the new optical/infrared Egyptian astronomical telescope. The ERA5 reanalysis data set is used to get the following meteorological parameters: Total cloud coverage fraction, precipitable water vapor, relative humidity, wind speed & direction and Air temperature. To estimate the aerosol optical depth we used the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2). Light pollution over the candidate sites was measured from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day Night Band (DNB). The seismic input in terms of maximum acceleration and response spectra were computed using a physics-based ground motion approach to assess the seismic hazards and consequently the designation of seismic resistant structure for the proposed sites to be able to assess the seismic hazards for the candidate sites. Of the seven nominated sites, two sites are found to have the best measurements and might be considered future sites for the new Egyptian Astronomical telescope. The first site is located in the south of the Sinai peninsula, while the second one is located in the Red Sea mountains region.

 - **Abstract**
 On 8 November 2013 a halo-type coronal mass ejection (CME) was observed, together with flares and type II radio bursts, but the association between the flares, radio bursts, and the CME was not clear. Our aim is to identify the origin of the CME and its direction of propagation, and to exclude features that were not connected to it. On the Earth-facing side, a GOES C5.7 class flare occurred close to the estimated CME launch time, followed by an X1.1 class flare. The latter flare was associated with an EUV wave and metric type II bursts. On the far side of the Sun, a filament eruption, EUV dimmings, and ejected CME loops were observed by imaging instruments onboard the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft that were viewing the backside of the Sun. The STEREO radio instruments observed an interplanetary (IP) type II radio burst at decameter-hectometric wavelengths, which was not observed by the radio instrument onboard the Wind spacecraft located at L1 near Earth. We show that the halo CME originated from the eruption on the far side of the Sun, and that the IP type II burst was created by a shock wave ahead of the halo CME. The radio burst remained unobserved from the earthside, even at heliocentric source heights larger than 9 solar radii. During the CME propagation, the X-class flare eruption caused a small plasmoid ejection earthward, the material of which was superposed on the earlier CME structures observed in projection. The estimated heights of the metric type II burst match well with the EUV wave launched by the X-class flare. As this radio emission did not continue to lower frequencies, we conclude that the shock wave did not propagate any further. Either the shock driver died out, as a blast wave, or the driver speed no longer exceeded the local Alfven speed.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos are known to undergo flavor conversion processes among the three flavors. The fast flavor conversion (FFC) has been the central piece of flavor conversions taking place in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) due to its shorter timescale to the completion of flavor conversion compared to other types of flavor conversion. Although the ordinary collisions between neutrinos and matter were once thought to decohere neutrinos and thus damp flavor conversions, it was recently realized that they can also induce the flavor conversion. The linear analysis showed that the so-called collisional flavor instability or CFI occurs in the absence of FFC. In this paper, we investigate if CFI takes place in of the post-bounce core of CCSNe, using the results of spherically symmetric Boltzmann simulations of CCSNe for four progenitor models with different masses. We also provide a necessary (but not sufficient) condition of matter properties for the occurrence of CFI in optically thick and semi-transparent regions; baryon mass density ($\rho$), electron fraction ($Y_e$), and the degeneracy of electron-type neutrinos ($\eta_{\nu_e}$) need to be $10^{10} {\rm g/cm^3} \lesssim \rho \lesssim 10^{12} {\rm g/cm^3}$, $Y_e\lesssim 0.4$, and $\eta_{\nu_e} \lesssim 0.5$, respectively. This condition allows us to easily locate the place of possible CFI occurence without detailed stability analyses, which is useful for analyzing CFI in CCSN models phenomenologically

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The dust in the active galactic nuclei is clearly present right outside the broad-line region (BLR), in the form of a dusty molecular torus. However, some models of the BLR predict that dust may also exist within the BLR. Aims. We study the reprocessing of the radiation by the BLR with the aim to see how the presence of the dust affects the reprocessed continuum and the line properties. Methods. We calculate a range of models with the use of CLOUDY photoionization code for dusty and dustless plasma. We pay particular attention to the well-studied object NGC 5548, and we compare the line equivalent width predictions with the observed data for this object. Results. We obtain a rough agreement between the expected equivalent widths of the H\b{eta} and Mg II lines with observed values for NGC 5548 for the line distances implied by the time-delay measurement (for H\b{eta}) and by the radius-luminosity relation (for Mg II) when the medium is dusty. The incident radiation is then consistent with the radiation seen by the observer, no shielding between the inner disk and the BLR is required. High ionization lines like He II, however, form clearly in the inner dustless region. When the additional absorber is present, the H\b{eta} emitting region moves closer, to the dustless part of the accretion disk surface.
#### Effects of Annihilation with Low-Energy Neutrinos on High-Energy  Neutrinos from Binary Neutron Star Mergers and Rare Core-Collapse Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the possibility that high-energy (HE) neutrinos produced at mildly relativistic shocks can be annihilated with low-energy (LE) neutrinos emitted from the accretion disk around a black hole in binary neutron star mergers and rare core-collapse supernovae. For HE neutrinos produced close to the stellar center ($\lesssim 10^{9}-10^{11}$ cm), we find that the emerging all-flavor spectrum for neutrinos of $E\gtrsim 0.1$ PeV could be modified by a factor $E^{-n}$ with $n\approx 0.4-0.5$. Flavor evolution of LE neutrinos does not affect this result but can change the emerging flavor composition of HE neutrinos. As a consequence, the above annihilation effect needs to be considered for HE neutrinos produced at nonrelativistic or mildly relativistic shocks at small radii. In particular, we point out that models of core-collapse supernovae with slow jets and charmed meson decay can better fit the diffuse HE neutrino flux observed by IceCube if annihilation of HE and LE neutrinos is taken into account. Moreover, the relevance of charmed meson and the annihilation effect can be tested by precise measurements of the diffuse neutrino spectrum and flavor composition.
#### Impact of the uncertainties of $3 α$ and $^{12}{\rm  C}(α,γ)^{16}{\rm O}$ reactions on the He-burning phases of low- and  intermediate-mass stars

 - **Abstract**
 We estimate the impact on the stellar evolution of the uncertainties in the $3\alpha$ and the $^{12}{\rm C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}{\rm O}$ reaction rates [...]. We calculated models of low- and intermediate-mass stars for different values of the rates. The $3\alpha$ reaction rate was varied up to $\pm 24\%$, while the $^{12}{\rm C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}{\rm O}$ reaction rate was varied by up to $\pm 35\%$. The models were calculated for two different initial chemical compositions to represent different stellar populations. A $M = 0.67$ $M_{\odot}$ model was chosen as representative of the halo ancient stars, while for disk stars, the $M=1.5$ $M_{\odot}$ and $M=2.5$ $M_{\odot}$ models were considered. The impact of the two reaction rates on the central He-burning lifetime and the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) lifetime, as well as the mass of the C/O core at the central He exhaustion and the internal C and O abundances, was investigated. A variation of the $^{12}{\rm C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}{\rm O}$ reaction rates resulted in marginal differences in the analysed features among the three considered stellar masses, except for the C/O abundances. The central He-burning lifetime changed by less than 4%, while the AGB lifetime was affected only at the 1% level. The internal C and O abundances showed greater variation, with a change of about 15%. The uncertainty in the $3\alpha$ reaction rate mainly influences the C and O central abundances (up to 10%) for all the models considered, and the AGB lifetime for intermediate mass stars (up to 5%). Most of the investigated features were affected by less than 2%. The current uncertainty in the two reaction rates has a negligible effect on the predicted evolutionary time scale with respect to other uncertainty sources. The variability in the chemical profile at the end of the shell He-burning phase is still relevant.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of high-resolution far-ultraviolet archival spectra obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope of the star HD 75309, which probes high-velocity shocked gas in the Vela supernova remnant (SNR). We examine high-velocity features from intrinsically strong absorption lines of O I, Si II, Si II*, C II, C II*, and Si III. We also detect high-velocity components in the N V doublet and compare these features to observations of high-velocity O VI absorption, available from archival Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer data. Kinetic temperatures are derived from the observed fractional abundances of the various ions, while gas densities and thermal pressures are obtained from the relative populations in excited fine-structure levels of C II and Si II. Our results indicate that the highly ionized species at high velocity probe gas in a region immediately behind a shock driven into an interstellar cloud, while the lower ionization species trace material further downstream in the cooling region of the post-shock flow. Low velocity N V and O VI absorption may trace gas in a conductive boundary layer between the unshocked portion of the cloud and the hot X-ray emitting intercloud medium. Temporal variations in high velocity Ca II absorption features observed toward HD 75309 further confirm the highly inhomogeneous nature of the interstellar medium interacting with the Vela SNR.
