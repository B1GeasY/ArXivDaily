#### An ALMA search for substructure and fragmentation in starless cores in  Orion B North

 - **Abstract**
 We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Cycle 3 observations of 73 starless and protostellar cores in the Orion B North molecular cloud. We detect a total of 34 continuum sources at 106 GHz, and after comparisons with other data, 4 of these sources appear to be starless. Three of the four sources are located near groupings of protostellar sources, while one source is an isolated detection. We use synthetic observations of a simulation modeling a collapsing turbulent, magnetized core to compute the expected number of starless cores that should be detectable with our ALMA observations and find at least two (1.52) starless core should be detectable, consistent with our data. We run a simple virial analysis of the cores to put the Orion B North observations into context with similar previous ALMA surveys of cores in Chamaeleon I and Ophiuchus. We conclude that the Chamaeleon I starless core population is characteristically less bounded than the other two populations, along with external pressure contributions dominating the binding energy of the cores. These differences may explain why the Chamaeleon I cores do not follow turbulent model predictions, while the Ophiuchus and Orion B North cores are consistent with the model.

 - **Abstract**
 Young {\alpha}-rich (YAR) stars within the old Galactic thick disk exhibit a dual characteristic of relative youth determined with asteroseismology and abundance enhancement in {\alpha} elements measured from high-resolution spectroscopy. The youth origin of YAR stars has been proposed to be binary evolution via mass transfer or stellar mergers. If that is the case, YAR stars should spin rapidly and thus be magnetically active, because they are mass and angular momentum gainers. In this study, to seek this binary footprint we select YAR stars on the main-sequence turn-off or the subgiant branch (MSTO-SGB) from APOGEE DR17, whose ages and projected rotation velocities (vsini) can be precisely measured. With APOGEE vsini and LAMOST spectra, we find that YAR stars are indeed fast rotators and magnetically active. In addition, we observe low [C/N] ratios and high Gaia RUWE in some YAR stars, suggesting that these MSTO-SGB stars probably have experienced mass transfer from red-giant companions. Our findings underscore that magnetic activity can serve as a valuable tool for probing the binary evolution for other chemically peculiar stars, such as red giants with lithium anomalies and carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an exhaustive photometric and spectroscopic analysis of TOI-837, a F9/G0 35 Myr young star, hosting a transiting exoplanet, TOI-837b, with an orbital period of 8.32d. Utilising data from TESS and ground-based observations, we determine a planetary radius of 0.82 R_J for TOI-837b. Through detailed HARPS spectroscopic time series analysis, we derive a Doppler semi-amplitude of 36 m/s, corresponding to a planetary mass of 0.39 M_J. The derived planetary properties suggest a substantial core of approximately 70 M_E, constituting about 60% of the planet's total mass. This finding poses a significant challenge to existing theoretical models of core formation. We propose that future atmospheric observations with JWST could provide insights into resolving ambiguities of TOI-837b, offering new perspectives on its composition, formation, and evolution.
#### A Cyclic Spectroscopy Scintillation Study of PSR B1937+21 I.  Demonstration of Improved Scintillometry

 - **Abstract**
 We use cyclic spectroscopy to perform high frequency-resolution analyses of multi-hour baseband Arecibo observations of the millisecond pulsar PSR B1937+21. This technique allows for the examination of scintillation features in far greater detail than is otherwise possible under most pulsar timing array observing setups. We measure scintillation bandwidths and timescales in each of eight subbands across a 200 MHz observing band in each observation. Through these measurements we obtain robust, intra-epoch estimates of the frequency scalings for scintillation bandwidth and timescale. Thanks to our high frequency resolution and the narrow scintles of this pulsar, we resolve scintillation arcs in the secondary spectra due to the increased Nyquist limit, which would not have been resolved at the same observing frequency with a traditional filterbank spectrum using NANOGrav's current time and frequency resolutions, and the frequency-dependent evolution of scintillation arc features within individual observations. We observe the dimming of prominent arc features at higher frequencies, possibly due to a combination of decreasing flux density and undetermined effects due to the interstellar medium. We also find agreement with arc curvature frequency dependence predicted by Stinebring et al. (2001) in some epochs. Thanks to the frequency resolution improvement provided by cyclic spectroscopy, these results show strong promise for future such analyses with millisecond pulsars, particularly for pulsar timing arrays, where such techniques can allow for detailed studies of the interstellar medium in highly scattered pulsars without sacrificing the timing resolution that is crucial to their gravitational wave detection efforts.

 - **Abstract**
 The spectral signatures of optical absorbers, when combined with those of infrared molecules, play a critical role in constraining the cloud properties of exoplanet atmospheres. We aim to use optical transmission spectroscopy to confirm the tentative color signature previously observed by multiband photometry in the atmosphere of hot Jupiter HAT-P-55b. We observed a transit of HAT-P-55b with the OSIRIS spectrograph on the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). We created two sets of spectroscopic light curves using the conventional band-integrated method and the newly proposed pixel-based method to derive the transmission spectrum. We performed Bayesian spectral retrieval analyses on the transmission spectrum to interpret the observed atmospheric properties. The transmission spectra derived from the two methods are consistent, both spectrally resolving the tentative color signature observed by MuSCAT2. The retrievals on the combined OSIRIS and MuSCAT2 transmission spectrum yield the detection of Na at 5.5$\sigma$ and the tentative detection of MgH at 3.4$\sigma$. The current optical-only wavelength coverage cannot constrain the absolute abundances of the atmospheric species. Space-based observations covering the molecular infrared bands or ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy are needed to further constrain the atmospheric properties of HAT-P-55b.
#### Extraction of YSO Cores and Active Regions near Star-forming Site AFGL  5157

 - **Abstract**
 We have carried out a quantitative analysis of the $1^{\circ} \times 1^{\circ}$ region near star-forming site AFGL 5157 using 'Minimal Spanning Tree' (MST). The analysis reveals that this region consists of five major clusters. The cluster radii of the cores and active regions were found to be varying between 0.75-2.62 pc and 2.77-4.58 pc, respectively, for these regions, while the aspect ratio varies between 0.71 to 7.17. This hints towards the clumpy as well as elongated clusters in the region. We calculated structure parameter Q for each region which varies between 0.41-0.62 and 0.23-0.81 for the cores and ARs, respectively. This shows the existence of fractal distribution in all the cores and ARs except the core of the [HKS2019] E70 bubble.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first comprehensive chemical study of a representative sample of 27 luminous red giant branch (RGB) stars belonging to Liller 1, a complex stellar system in the Galactic bulge. This study is based on medium-resolution near-infrared spectra acquired with X-shooter at the Very Large Telescope. We found a subpopulation counting 22 stars with subsolar metallicity ($<$[Fe/H]$>=-0.31\pm0.02$ and 1$\sigma$ dispersion of 0.08 dex) and with enhanced [$\alpha$/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [K/Fe] that likely formed early and quickly from gas that was mainly enriched by type II supernovae, and a metal-rich population counting 5 stars with supersolar metallicity ($<$[Fe/H]$>$=+0.22$\pm$0.03 and 1$\sigma$ dispersion of 0.06 dex) and roughly solar-scaled [$\alpha$/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [K/Fe] that formed at later epochs from gas that was also enriched by type Ia supernovae. Moreover, both subpopulations show enhanced [Na/Fe], as in the bulge field, about solar-scaled [V/Fe], and depletion of [C/Fe] and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C with respect to the solar values. This indicates that mixing and extra-mixing processes during the RGB evolution also occur at very high metallicities. Notably, no evidence of a Na-O anticorrelation, which is considered the fingerprint of genuine globular clusters, has been found. This challenges any formation scenarios that invoke the accretion of a molecular cloud or an additional stellar system onto a genuine globular cluster. The results of this study underline the strong chemical similarity between Liller 1 and Terzan 5 and support the hypothesis that these complex stellar systems might be fossil fragments of the epoch of Galactic bulge formation.

 - **Abstract**
 (Edited) Many fast rotator stars (rotation periods of < 2 days) are found in unresolved binaries with separations of tens of au. This correlation leads to the question of whether the formation of binary stars inherently produces fast rotators. We aim to understand whether the formation of companions plays a role in spinning up stars. We use magneto-hydrodynamical simulations to study the formation of multiple star systems from turbulent and non-turbulent protostellar cores. We track the angular momentum accreted by individual star and inner disc systems by using a sink particle technique. We run a resolution study to extrapolate protostellar properties. We find in all simulations that the primary star can experience spin-up events that are correlated with the formation of companions. The primary star can spin up by up to 84% of its pre-fragmentation angular momentum and by up to 18% of its pre-fragmentation mass-specific angular momentum. The mechanism for the spin-up is gravitational disc instabilities in the circumstellar disc around the primary star, leading to the accretion of material with high specific angular momentum. The simulations that experience the strongest disc instabilities fragment to form companions. Simulations with weaker spin-up events experience disc instabilities triggered by a companion flyby, and the disc instability in these cases does not produce further fragments. We conclude that the primary star in multiple star systems may end up with a higher spin than single stars. This is because gravitational instabilities in the circumstellar disc around the primary star can trigger a spin-up event. In the strongest spin-up events, the instability is likely to cause disc fragmentation and the formation of companions. This companion formation coupled with shorter disc lifetimes, because the companion truncates the circumstellar disc, can help produce fast rotators.
#### Recommendations for Early Definition Science with the Nancy Grace Roman  Space Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman), NASA's next flagship observatory, has significant mission time to be spent on surveys for general astrophysics in addition to its three core community surveys. We considered what types of observations outside the core surveys would most benefit from early definition, given 700 hours of mission time in the first two years of Roman's operation. We recommend that a survey of the Galactic plane be defined early, based on the broad range of stakeholders for such a survey, the added scientific value of a first pass to obtain a baseline for proper motions complementary to Gaia's, and the significant potential synergies with ground-based surveys, notably the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) on Rubin. We also found strong motivation to follow a community definition process for ultra-deep observations with Roman.
