 - **Abstract**
 The satellite galaxy Crater II of the Milky Way is extremely cold and exceptionally diffuse. These unusual properties are challenging to understand in the standard model of cold dark matter. We investigate the formation of Crater II in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), where dark matter particles can scatter and thermalize. We conduct a series of controlled N-body simulations to model the tidal evolution of Crater II, varying the self-interacting cross section, orbit parameters, and initial stellar distribution. Dark matter self-interactions lead to halo core formation and the distribution of stars expands accordingly. A cored SIDM halo also boosts tidal mass loss, allowing for a high orbit. Our simulations show that SIDM halos with a $1~{\rm kpc}$ core can simultaneously explain the low stellar velocity dispersion and the large half-light radius of Crater II, remaining robust to the initial distribution of stars. For the orbit motivated by the measurements from Gaia Early Data Release 3, the favored self-interacting cross section is approximately $60~{\rm cm^2/g}$ on the mass scale of Crater II.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova remnants interacting with molecular/atomic clouds are interesting X-ray sources to study broadband nonthermal emission. X-ray line emission in these systems can be produced by different processes, e.g. low energy cosmic rays interacting with the cloud and fast ejecta fragments moving in the cloud. The paper aims at studying the origin of the non-thermal X-ray emission of the southwestern limb of SN 1006 beyond the main shock, in order to distinguish if the emission is due to low energy cosmic rays diffusing in the cloud or to ejecta knots moving into the cloud. We analyzed the X-ray emission of the southwestern limb of SN 1006, where the remnant interacts with an atomic cloud, with three different X-ray telescopes ({NuSTAR, Chandra and XMM-Newton) and performed a combined spectro-imaging analysis of this region. The analysis of the non thermal X-ray emission of the southwestern limb of SN 1006, interacting with an atomic cloud, has shown the detection of an extended X-ray source in the atomic cloud, approximately $2$ pc upstream of the shock front. The source is characterized by a hard continuum (described by a power law with photon index $\Gamma\sim1.4$) and by Ne, Si and Fe emission lines. The observed flux suggests that the origin of the X-ray emission is not associated with low energy cosmic rays interacting with the cloud. On the other hand, the spectral properties of the source, together with the detection of an IR counterpart visible with \textit{Spitzer}-MIPS at 24 $\mu$m are in good agreement with expectations for a fast ejecta fragment moving within the atomic cloud. We detected X-ray and IR emission from a possible ejecta fragment, with radius approximately 1$\times10^{17}$ cm, and mass approximately $10^{-3}M_\odot$ at about 2 pc out of the shell of SN 1006, in the interaction region between the southwestern limb of the remnant and the atomic cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 The spatial distribution of Galactic stars with different chemical abundances encodes information on the processes that drove the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. Survey selection functions are indispensable for analysing astronomical catalogues produced by large-scale surveys. The use of these selection functions in data modelling is more complex when data from different surveys are to be modelled simultaneously. We introduce a procedure for constructing the selection function of a sample of red clump stars that have parallaxes and elemental abundances from the Gaia mission. We separately constructed the selection function of the APOGEE DR17 red clump stars, which depends on very different observables and has a very different spatial coverage. We combined the two surveys and accounted for their joint selection function to provide strong constraints on the radial and vertical density distribution of mono-abundance populations, with Gaia offering a dense coverage of the solar neighbourhood, while APOGEE reaches larger distances near the Galactic plane. We confirm that the radial density profile steepens with increasing metallicity. The combined sample also indicates a metallicity-dependent flaring of the alpha-poor disc. We provide the code for constructing the Gaia selection function we used in this study through the GaiaUnlimited Python package.
#### Can the giant planets of the Solar System form via pebble accretion in a  smooth protoplanetary disc?

 - **Abstract**
 Prevailing $N$-body planet formation models typically start with lunar-mass embryos and show a general trend of rapid migration of massive planetary cores to the inner Solar System in the absence of a migration trap. This setup cannot capture the evolution from a planetesimal to embryo, which is crucial to the final architecture of the system. We aim to model planet formation with planet migration starting with planetesimals of $\sim10^{-6}$ -- $10^{-4}M_\oplus$ and reproduce the giant planets of the Solar System. We simulated a population of 1,000 -- 5,000 planetesimals in a smooth protoplanetary disc, which was evolved under the effects of their mutual gravity, pebble accretion, gas accretion, and planet migration, employing the parallelized $N$-body code SyMBAp. We find that the dynamical interactions among growing planetesimals are vigorous and can halt pebble accretion for excited bodies. While a set of results without planet migration produces one to two gas giants and one to two ice giants beyond 6 au, massive planetary cores readily move to the inner Solar System once planet migration is in effect. Dynamical heating is important in a planetesimal disc and the reduced pebble encounter time should be considered in similar models. Planet migration remains a challenge to form cold giant planets in a smooth protoplanetary disc, which suggests an alternative mechanism is required to stop them at wide orbits.
#### Formation of flattened planetesimals by gravitational collapse of  rotating pebble clouds

 - **Abstract**
 Planetesimals are believed to form by the gravitational collapse of aerodynamically concentrated clumps of pebbles. Many properties of the objects in the cold classical Kuiper belt -- such as binarity, rotation, and size distribution -- are in agreement with this gravitational collapse model. Further support comes from the pebble-pile structure inferred for comet nuclei. For this study, we simulated the final assembly of a planetesimal from the gravitational collapse of a rotating clump of pebbles. We implemented a numerical method from granular dynamics to follow the collapse that includes the transition from a pebble swarm to solid cells at a high density. We compared the shapes of the simulated planetesimals with the shapes of the lobes of contact binaries and bilobed Solar System objects. We find that the gravitational collapse of slowly rotating pebble clouds naturally explains the formation of flattened ellipsoidal bodies. This result agrees well with the flattened structure of the bilobed planetesimal Arrokoth and the shapes of the components of bilobed comets.

 - **Abstract**
 A recent study by Hon et al. reported that a close-in planet around the red clump star, 8 UMi, should have been engulfed during the expansion phase of the stellar evolution. They explained the survival of this exoplanet through a binary merger channel for 8 UMi. The key to testing this formation scenario is to derive the true age of this star: an old "imposter" resulting from a binary merger or a genuinely young red clump giant? To accomplish this, we derive kinematic and chemical properties for 8 UMi using astrometric data from $Gaia$ DR3 and the element-abundance pattern measured from a high-resolution ($R \sim 75,000$) spectrum taken by SOPHIE. Our analysis shows that 8 UMi is a normal thin-disk star with orbital rotation speed of $\it{V}_\mathrm{\phi}=\mathrm{244.96 km s^{-1}}$, and possesses a Solar metallicity ([Fe/H] $= -0.01 \pm 0.07$) and $\alpha$-element abundance ratio ([$\alpha$/Fe] $= 0.00 \pm 0.03$). By adopting well-established relationships between age and space velocities/elemental abundances, we estimate a kinematic age of $3.50^{+3.00}_{-2.00}$ Gyr, and a chemical age of $2.75^{+1.50}_{-1.00}$ Gyr from [C/N] and $3.47 \pm 1.96$ Gyr from [Y/Mg] for 8 UMi, respectively. These estimates are consistent with the isochrone-fitting age ($1.85^{+0.55}_{-0.30}$ Gyr) of 8 UMi, but are all much younger than 8.6 Gyr required in a binary merger scenario. This result challenges the binary merger model; the existence of such a closely orbiting exoplanet around a giant star remains a mystery yet to be resolved.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars condition the evolution of the interstellar medium by the amount of energy released during their lives and especially by their deaths as supernova explosions. The vast amounts of spectroscopic data for massive stars provided by previous and existing instruments on ground-based and space-based telescopes have already saturated our capability to process them by the use of human routines. As a consequence, there is a pressing need for machine-assisted tools to help handle incoming data. To this end, we present the development of a massive star spectroscopic multiwavelength interactive database designed for scientific research and a fully automatic stellar parameter determination tool. Here we show the preliminary results of the application of these tools to optical spectra of O-type stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first JWST MIRI and NIRCam observations of the prominent debris disk around Beta Pictoris. Coronagraphic observations in 8 filters spanning from 1.8 to 23~$\mu$m provide an unprecedentedly clear view of the disk at these wavelengths. The objectives of the observing program were to investigate the dust composition and distribution, and to investigate the presence of planets in the system. In this paper, we focus on the disk components, providing surface brightness measurements for all images and a detailed investigation of the asymmetries observed. A companion paper by Kammerer et al. will focus on the planets in this system using the same data. We report for the first time the presence of an extended secondary disk in thermal emission, with a curved extension bent away from the plane of the disk. This feature, which we refer to as the ``cat's tail", seems to be connected with the previously reported CO clump, mid-infrared asymmetry detected in the southwest side, and the warp observed in scattered light. We present a model of this secondary disk sporadically producing dust that broadly reproduces the morphology, flux, and color of the cat's tail, as well as other features observed in the disk, and suggests the secondary disk is composed largely of porous, organic refractory dust grains.
