 - **Abstract**
 Using MeerKAT, we have discovered three new millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the bulge globular cluster M62: M62H, M62I, and M62J. All three are in binary systems, which means all ten known pulsars in the cluster are in binaries. M62H has a planetary-mass companion with a median mass $M_{\rm c,med} \sim 3$ M$_{\rm J}$ and a mean density of $\rho \sim 11$ g cm$^{-3}$. M62I has an orbital period of 0.51 days and a $M_{\rm c,med} \sim 0.15$ M$_{\odot}$. Neither of these low-mass systems exhibit eclipses. M62J has only been detected in the two UHF band (816 MHz) observations with a flux density $S_{816} = 0.08$ mJy. The non-detection in the L-band (1284 MHz) indicates it has a relatively steep spectrum ($\beta < -3.1$). We also present 23-yr-long timing solutions obtained using data from the Parkes "Murriyang", Effelsberg and MeerKAT telescopes for the six previously known pulsars. For all these pulsars, we measured the second spin-period derivatives and the rate of change of orbital period caused by the gravitational field of the cluster, and their proper motions. From these measurements, we conclude that the pulsars' maximum accelerations are consistent with the maximum cluster acceleration assuming a core-collapsed mass distribution. Studies of the eclipses of the redback M62B and the black widow M62E at four and two different frequency bands, respectively, reveal a frequency dependence with longer and asymmetric eclipses at lower frequencies. The presence of only binary MSPs in this cluster challenges models which suggest that the MSP population of core-collapsed clusters should be dominated by isolated MSPs.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a $(1.0 \pm 0.28) \times 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ Supermassive Black Hole (BH) at the centre of NGC 708, the Brightest Cluster Galaxy of Abell 262. Such high BH masses are very rare and allow to investigate BH - host galaxy scaling relations at the high mass end, which in turn provide hints about the (co)evolution of such systems. NGC~708 is found to be an outlier in all the canonical scaling relations except for those linking the BH mass to the core properties. The galaxy mass-to-light ratio points to a Kroupa IMF rather than Salpeter, with this finding confirmed using photometry in two different bands. We perform this analysis using our novel triaxial Schwarzschild code to integrate orbits in a 5-dimensional space, using a semi-parametric deprojected light density to build the potential and non-parametric Line-of-Sight Velocity Distributions (LOSVDs) derived from long-slit spectra recently acquired at Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) to exploit the full information in the kinematic. We find that the galaxy geometry changes as a function of the radius going from prolate, nearly spherical in the central regions to triaxial at large radii, highlighting the need to go beyond constant shape profiles. Our analysis is only the second of its kind and will systematically be used in the future to hunt Supermassive Black Holes in giant ellipticals.

 - **Abstract**
 To understand the magnetic fields of the polar crown filaments (PCFs) at high latitudes near polar regions of the Sun, we perform magnetofrictional numerical simulations on the long-term magnetic evolution of bipolar fields with roughly east-west polarity inversion lines (PILs) in a three-dimensional (3D) spherical wedge domain near polar regions. The Coriolis effect induced vortical motions at the boundaries of several supergranular cells inject magnetic helicity from the photospheric boundary into the solar atmosphere. Supergranular-scale helicity injection, transfer, and condensation produce strongly sheared magnetic fields. Magnetic reconnections at footpoints of the sheared fields produce magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) with helicity signs consistent with the observed Hemispheric Helicity Rule (HHR). The cross-sectional area of MFRs exhibits an uneven distribution, resembling a "foot-node-foot" periodic configuration. Experiments with different tilt directions of PILs indicate that the PCFs preferably form along PILs with the western end close to the polar region. The bending of PILs caused by supergranular flows, forming S-shape (Z-shape) PIL segments, promotes the formation of dextral (sinistral) MFRs. The realistic magnetic models we got can serve as starting points for the study of the plasma formation and eruption of PCFs.

 - **Abstract**
 In the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), protoplanetary disks exhibit ionized gas clouds in the form of a striking teardrop shape as massive stars irradiate the disk material. We present the first spatially and spectrally resolved observations of 12 proplyds, using Integral Field Spectroscopy observations performed with the MUSE instrument in Narrow Field Mode (NFM) on the VLT. We present the morphology of the proplyds in seven emission lines and measure the radius of the ionization front of the targets in four tracers, covering transitions of different ionization states for the same element. We also derive stellar masses for the targets. The measurements follow a consistent trend of increasing I-front radius for a decreasing strength of the far-UV radiation as expected from photoevaporation models. By analyzing the ratios of the I-front radii as measured in the emission lines of Ha, [OI] 6300, [OII] 7330, and [OIII] 5007, we observe the ionization stratification, that is, the most ionized part of the flow being the furthest from the disk (and closest to the UV source). The ratios of I-front radii scale in the same way for all proplyds in our sample regardless of the incident radiation. We show that the stratification can help constrain the densities near the I-front by using a 1D photoionization model. We derive the upper limits of photoevaporative mass-loss rates by assuming ionization equilibrium, and estimate values decreasing towards lower impinging radiation. We do not find a correlation between Mloss and stellar mass. The highest mass-loss rate is for the proplyd 244-440. These values of Mloss, combined with estimates of the disk mass with ALMA, confirm previous estimates of the short lifetime of these proplyds. This work demonstrates the potential of this dataset and offers a new set of observables to be used to test current and future models of external photoevaporation.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar filament eruptions are often characterized by stepwise evolution due to the involvement of multiple mechanisms, such as magnetohydrodynamic instabilities and magnetic reconnection. In this article, we investigated a confined filament eruption with a distinct two-stage evolution by using the imaging and spectroscopic observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The eruption originated from a kinked filament thread that separated from an active region filament. In the first stage, the filament thread rose slowly and was obstructed due to flux pile-up in its front. This obstruction brought the filament thread into reconnection with a nearby loop-like structure, which enlarged the flux rope and changed its connectivity through the foot-point migration. The newly formed flux rope became more kink unstable and drove the rapid eruption in the second stage. It ascended into the upper atmosphere and initiated the reconnection with the overlying field. Finally, the flux rope was totally disintegrated, producing several solar jets along the overlying field. These observations demonstrate that the external reconnection between the flux rope and overlying field can destroy the flux rope, thus playing a crucial role in confining the solar eruptions.

 - **Abstract**
 Hierarchical massive quadruple systems are ideal laboratories for examining the theories of star formation, dynamical evolution, and stellar evolution. The successive mergers of hierarchical quadruple systems might explain the mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. Looking for light curves of O-type binaries identified by LAMOST, we find a (2+2) quadruple system: TYC 3340-2437-1, located in the stellar bow-shock nebula (SBN). It has a probability of over 99.99\% being a quadruple system derived from the surface density of the vicinity stars. Its inner orbital periods are 3.390602(89) days and 2.4378(16) days, respectively, and the total mass is about (11.47 + 5.79) + (5.2 + 2.02) = 24.48 $M_{\odot}$. The line-of-sight inclinations of the inner binaries, B$_1$ and B$_2$, are 55.94 and 78.2 degrees, respectively, indicating that they are not co-planar. Based on observations spanning 34 months and the significance of the astrometric excess noise ($D>2$) in Gaia DR3 data, we guess that its outer orbital period might be a few years. If it were true, the quadruple system might form through the disk fragmentation mechanism with outer eccentric greater than zero. This eccentricity could be the cause of both the arc-like feature of the SBN and the noncoplanarity of the inner orbit. The outer orbital period and outer eccentric could be determined with the release of future epoch astrometric data of Gaia.
#### On the chemical and kinematic signatures of the resonances of the  Galactic bar as revealed by the LAMOST-APOGEE red clump stars

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way is widely considered to exhibit features of a rotational bar or quadrupole bar. In either case, the feature of the resonance of the Galactic bar should be present in the properties of the chemistry and kinematics, over a large area of the disk. With a sample of over 170,000 red clump (RC) stars from LAMOST-APOGEE data, we attempt to detect the chemical and kinematic signatures of the resonances of the Galactic bar, within 4.0 $\leq$ $R$ $\leq$ 15.0 kpc and $|Z|$ $\leq$ 3.0 kpc. The measurement of the $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ $-$ $R$ with subtracted the global profiles trends, shows that the thin and thick disks values Cor_$\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ = 0.010 $\mathrm{sin}$ (1.598 $R$ + 2.551) and Cor_$\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ = 0.006 $\mathrm{sin}$ (1.258 $R$ $-$ 0.019), respectively. The analysis of the tilt angle of the velocity ellipsoid indicates that the thin and thick disks are accurately described as $\alpha$ = $\alpha_{0}$ arctan (Z/R), with $\alpha_{0}$ = 0.198 $\mathrm{sin}$ (0.853 $R$ + 1.982) + 0.630 and $\alpha_{0}$ = 0.220 $\mathrm{sin}$ (0.884 $R$ + 2.012) + 0.679 for thin and thick disks, respectively. These periodic oscillations in Cor_$\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ and $\alpha_{0}$ with $R$ appear in both thin and thick disks, are the most likely chemical and kinematic signatures of the resonance of the Galactic bar. The difference in the phase of the functions of the fitted periodic oscillations for the thin and thick disks may be related to the presence of a second Galactic bar.

 - **Abstract**
 As the brightest gamma-ray burst ever observed, GRB 221009A provided a precious opportunity to explore spectral line features. In this paper, we performed a comprehensive spectroscopy analysis of GRB 221009A jointly with GECAM-C and Fermi/GBM data to search for emission and absorption lines. For the first time we investigated the line feature throughout this GRB including the most bright part where many instruments suffered problems, and identified prominent emission lines in multiple time intervals. The central energy of the Gaussian emission line evolves from about 37 MeV to 6 MeV, with a nearly constant ratio (about 10\%) between the line width and central energy. Particularly, we find that both the central energy and the energy flux of the emission line evolve with time as a power law decay with power law index of -1 and -2 respectively. We suggest that the observed emission lines most likely originate from the blue-shifted electron positron pair annihilation 511 keV line. We find that a standard high latitude emission scenario cannot fully interpret the observation, thus we propose that the emission line comes from some dense clumps with electron positron pairs traveling together with the jet. In this scenario, we can use the emission line to directly, for the first time, measure the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet ($\Gamma$) and reveal its time evolution (i.e. $\Gamma \sim t^{-1}$) during the prompt emission. Interestingly, we find that the flux of the annihilation line in the co-moving frame keeps constant. These discoveries of the spectral line features shed new and important lights on the physics of GRB and relativistic jet.

 Context. Investigating the diagnostic power of H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ Charge-Exchange (CE) emission as Low-Energy Galactic Cosmic Rays(LECRs) tracer in diffuse regions. Aims. In this work, we define and test a spectroscopic indicator of CE reactions between LECRs protons and neutral hydrogen atoms of the diffuse medium. This indicator can be used for mapping LECRs density in diffuse clouds and can lead to the identification of new LECRs sources as we expect density variations caused by the distance between an observed cloud and the nearest site of particle acceleration. We also lay the foundations for the definition of a photometric indicator to be used in the next full-sky photometric surveys such as the Vera Rubin 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Methods. Based on literature cross-sections, we calculate H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ line profile ratio in the case of CE and compare it with the recombination ratio. We then test our results on the Balmer-dominated filaments of the SNR RCW 86 and we explore how the spectroscopic constraints can turn into a photometric indicator based on colour indices. Results. We find that, in shocked environments, CE between LECRS and neutral hydrogen become the dominant process for Balmer lines emission. The hydrogen spectroscopic emission is expected to be modified, with respect to the recombination Balmer decrement,to result in double the H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ with respect to a similar but quiescent region. The test on the known Balmer-dominated filaments of the SNR RCW 86 confirm the efficiency of our spectroscopic indicator. Therefore we explore possible conversions of the spectroscopic indicator into colour indices combinations. This is the first step toward the definition and test of a photometric indicator for tracing LECRs to be applied in the LSST pipelines to photometrically identify new LECRs accelerators in the whole Galaxy.
#### Feedback and galaxy dynamics: A study of turbulence and star formation  in 34 galaxies using the PHANGS survey

 - **Abstract**
 The correlation between interstellar turbulent speed and local star formation rate surface density, Sigma_SFR, is studied using CO observations in the PHANGS survey. The local velocity dispersion of molecular gas, sigma, increases with Sigma_SFR, but the virial parameter, alpha_vir, is about constant, suggesting the molecular gas remains self-gravitating. The correlation arises because sigma depends on the molecular surface density, Sigma_mol, and object cloud mass, M_mol, with the usual molecular cloud correlations, while Sigma_SFR increases with both of these quantities because of a nearly constant star formation efficiency for CO. Pressure fluctuations with Delta Sigma_SFR are also examined. Azimuthal variations of molecular pressure, Delta P_mol, have a weaker correlation with Delta Sigma_SFR than expected from the power-law correlation between the total quantities, suggesting slightly enhanced SFR efficiency per molecule in spiral arms. Dynamical equilibrium pressure and star formation rate correlate well for the whole sample, as P_DE~Sigma_SFR^1.3, which is steeper than in other studies. The azimuthal fluctuations, Delta P_DE(Delta Sigma_SFR), follow the total correlation P_DE(Sigma_SFR) closely, hinting that some of this correlation may be a precursor to star formation, rather than a reaction. Galactic dynamical processes correlate linearly such that Sigma_SFR~(Sigma_gas R)^(1.0\pm0.3) for total gas surface density Sigma_gas and galactic dynamical rates, R, equal to kappa, A, or Omega, representing epicyclic frequency, shear rate A, and orbit rate Omega. These results suggest important roles for both feedback and galactic dynamics.
#### The physics of Core-Collapse Supernovae: explosion mechanism and  explosive nucleosynthesis

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12942
 - **Abstract**
 Recent developments in multi-dimensional simulations of core-collapse supernovae have considerably improved our understanding of this complex phenomenon. In addition to that, one-dimensional (1D) studies have been employed to study the explosion mechanism and its causal connection to the pre-collapse structure of the star, as well as to explore the vast parameter space of supernovae. Nonetheless, many uncertainties still affect the late stages of the evolution of massive stars, their collapse, and the subsequent shock propagation. In this review, we will briefly summarize the state-of-the-art of both 1D and 3D simulations and how they can be employed to study the evolution of massive stars, supernova explosions, and shock propagation, focusing on the uncertainties that affect each of these phases. Finally, we will illustrate the typical nucleosynthesis products that emerge from the explosion.
