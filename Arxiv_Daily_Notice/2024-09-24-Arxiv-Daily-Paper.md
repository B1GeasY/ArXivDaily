#### The Extreme Activity in Comet Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1): Investigations of Extensive, Narrowband Photoelectric Photometry

 - **Abstract**
 Conventional narrowband photoelectric photometry of Comet Hale-Bopp (1995 O1) was obtained on 99 nights from mid-1995 to early-2000, yielding gas and dust production rates over an unprecedented range of time and distance. The appearance of Hale-Bopp presented a prime opportunity for active comet studies and its inherent brightness and orbital geometry allowed the characterization of its long-term activity. Throughout the apparition Hale-Bopp released, by far, more gas and dust than any other comet ever measured. As a very high dust-to-gas ratio object, dust production was successfully measured throughout the apparition, with dust consistently slightly red in color. All five gas species including OH and NH were detected just inside of 5 AU inbound, while C2 and C3 were detected to just past 5 AU outbound and CN was followed until nearly 7.7 AU. Heliocentric distance dependencies ranged between -1.2 to -2.7 in log-log space, with the extremes magnified by the large extrapolations in Haser model parameters at large distances. Hale-Bopp's enormous size and associated extremely high outgassing resulted in a much larger collisional zone, which in turn yielded outflow velocities more than 2x higher than ever previously measured at comparable distances. Even so, volatile composition remained within the "typical" classification, consistent with most Oort Cloud comets, and water production follows the expected curve based on a standard water vaporization model. However, seasonal effects provided evidence for inhomogeneities among the major source regions on the surface of the nucleus. Preliminary modeling of the nucleus and coma successfully matches this seasonal behavior.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars and planets form in regions of enhanced stellar density, subjecting protoplanetary discs to gravitational perturbations from neighbouring stars. Observations in the Taurus star-forming have uncovered evidence of at least three recent, star-disc encounters that have truncated discs (HV/DO Tau, RW Aurigae, UX Tau), raising questions about the frequency of such events. We aim to assess the probability of observing truncating star-disc encounters in Taurus. We generate a physically motivated dynamical model including binaries and spatial-kinematic substructure to follow the historical dynamical evolution and stellar encounters in the Taurus star forming region. We track the star-disc encounters and outer disc radius evolution over the lifetime of Taurus. A quarter of discs are truncated below 30 au by dynamical encounters, but this truncation mostly occurs in binaries over the course of a few orbital periods, on a time-scale $\lesssim 0.1$ Myr. Nonetheless, some truncating encounters still occur up to the present age of Taurus. Strongly truncating encounters (ejecting $\gtrsim 10$ percent of the disc mass) occur at a rate $\sim 10$ Myr$^{-1}$, sufficient to explain the encounter between HV and DO Tau $\sim 0.1$ Myr ago. If encounters that eject only $\sim 1$ percent of the disc mass are responsible for RW Aurigae and UX Tau, then they are also expected with encounter rate $\Gamma_\mathrm{enc} \sim 100{-}200$ Myr$^{-1}$. However, the observed sample of recent encounters is probably incomplete, since these examples occurred in systems that are not consistent with random drawing from the mass function. One more observed example would statistically imply additional physics, such as replenishment of the outer disc material.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-spatial-resolution (0.7 to 1.0 arcsec) submillimeter observations of continuum and molecular lines of CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3, and H2CCO toward 11 high-mass star-forming regions using the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA). A total of 19 separate cores from 9 high-mass star-forming regions are found to be line-rich, including high-, intermediate-, and low-mass line-rich cores. The three molecules are detected in these line-rich cores. We map the emission of CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3, and H2CCO in 9 high-mass star-forming regions. The spatial distribution of the three molecules is very similar and concentrated in the areas of intense continuum emission. We also calculate the rotation temperatures, column densities, and abundances of CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3, and H2CCO under the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) assumption. The abundances relative to H2 and CH3OH, and line widths of the three molecules are significantly correlated. The abundances relative to H2, temperatures and line widths of the three molecules tend to be higher in cores with higher mass and outflows detected. The possible chemical links of the three molecules are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Sulfur-bearing molecules are commonly detected in dense cores within star-forming regions, but the total sulfur budget is significantly low, when compared to the interstellar medium (ISM) value. The properties of sulfur-bearing molecules are not well understood due to the absence of large sample studies with uniform observational configurations. To deepen our understanding of this subject, we conducted a study using ALMA 870 \micron~observations of 11 massive protoclusters. By checking the spectra of 248 dense cores in 11 massive protoclusters, a total of 10 sulfur-bearing species (CS, SO, \htcs, NS, \sot, \ttso, \tfsot, \ttsot, \seoo, \octfs) were identified. The parameters including systemic velocities, line widths, gas temperatures, column densities, and abundances were derived. Our results indicate that SO appears to be more easily detected in a wider range of physical environments than \htcs, despite these two species show similarities in gas distributions and abundances. \tfsot~and \htcs~are good tracers of the temperature of sulfur-bearing species, in which \htcs~traces the outer warm envelope and \tfsot~is associated with high-temperature central-regions. High-mass star-forming feedback (outflow and other non-thermal motions) significantly elevates the sulfur-bearing molecular abundances and detection rates specifically for \sot~and SO. A positive correlation between the \sot~abundance increasing factor ($F$) and temperatures suggests that \sot~could serve as a sulfur reservoir on the grain mantles of dense cores and then can be desorbed from dust to gas phase as the temperature rises. This work shows the importance of a large and unbiased survey to understand the sulfur depletion in dense cores.

 - **Abstract**
 Sulfur-bearing species play critical roles in atmospheric physical-chemical processes, atmosphere-surface interactions, and the geological evolution of Venus. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of (1) Instrumental data on the abundance and speciation of sulfur in atmospheric and crustal materials, (2) the behavior of sulfur-bearing species in the mesosphere, clouds, and lower atmosphere, (3) chemical and mineralogical aspects of atmosphere-surface interactions, (4) the fate of sulfur during the formation, differentiation, and geological evolution of Venus, including volcanic degassing, gas-solid reactions at the surface, a putative aqueous period, and subsequent evolution. The chapter also outlines outstanding questions and discusses further exploration of Venus in the context of sulfur-relevant investigations.

 - **Abstract**
 We live in an exoplanet revolution, with more than 5,000 exoplanets detected to date. Our ability to characterise individual exoplanets is constantly improving, with exquisite mass and radius measurements for an ever-growing sample of planets, complimented by atmospheric characterisation of lower and lower mass planets. This chapter outlines a complimentary set of observations that uniquely provide bulk elemental compositions for exoplanetary material. Absorption features from metals, including Mg, Fe, Si, O, Ca, Al, Ni and Ti in the white dwarf photosphere characterise the composition of accreted planetary material. These observations highlight the diversity in composition across exoplanetary systems including volatile content and probe key geological processes including the formation of iron cores. Thanks to the many white dwarfs identified by the space satellite {\it Gaia}, a revolution in the spectroscopic characterisation of white dwarfs is underway.
#### Revealing the state transition of Cen X-3 at high spectral resolution with Chandra

 - **Abstract**
 Cen X-3 is a compact, high-mass X-ray binary (HMXRB), likely powered by Roche lobe overflow. We present a phase-resolved X-ray spectral and timing analysis of a target of opportunity \textit{Chandra} observation made during a low-flux to high-flux transition. The high-resolution spectra allow us to delve into the events that occurred during this episode. The spectrum is described by a single black body absorbed by a local column density of the order of $10^{23-24}$ cm$^{-2}$, which is one to two orders of magnitude higher than found for previous analyses of data taken at similar orbital phases. Such a large column produces a Compton shoulder in the Fe K$\alpha$ line. The transition appears to be caused by the onset of efficient cooling, which cools the plasma by 10 million degrees in just 10 ks, allowing matter to enter the magnetosphere. This happens after a major disturbance, probably the arrival of a train of wind clumps with individual masses in the range $10^{19-20}$ g. This train moves ballistically in an eccentric orbit around the NS, producing a distinctive Doppler modulation in the \ion{Fe}{xxv} line.

 - **Abstract**
 Non-radiative shocks accelerate particles and heat astrophysical plasmas. While supernova remnants are the most well-studied example, neutron star (NS) bow shocks are also non-radiative and Balmer-dominated. NS bow shocks are likely ubiquitous in the interstellar medium due to their large speeds imparted at birth, and they are thought to be a discrete source population contributing to the Galactic cosmic ray spectrum. To date, nine NS bow shocks have been directly observed in H$\alpha$ images. Most of these shocks have been characterized using narrowband H$\alpha$ imaging and slit spectroscopy, which do not resolve the multi-component velocity structure of the shocks and their spatial geometry. Here we present integral field spectroscopy of three NS bow shocks: J0742$-$2822, J1741$-$2054, and J2225$+$6535 (the Guitar Nebula). We measure the shock properties simultaneously in four dimensions: the 2D projected shock morphology, the radial velocity structure, and the H$\alpha$ flux. The broad-to-narrow line ratio ($I_{\rm b}/I_{\rm n}$) is inferred from radial velocity profiles, and for J1741$-$2054 the narrow line is detected in multiple regions of the shock. The inferred line ratios and widths suggest that NS bow shocks represent a low shock velocity regime in which electron-ion temperature equilibration is low, contrary to the trend seen in supernova remnants. While the low velocity regime is poorly captured by state-of-the-art simulations, these results may imply electron injection efficiency is lower for bow shocks than their counterparts in supernova remnants.

 - **Abstract**
 High-cadence surveys of the sky are revealing that a large fraction of red-supergiant (RSG) stars, which are progenitors of Type II-Plateau (II-P) supernovae (SNe), explode within circumstellar material (CSM). Such SNe II-P/CSM exhibit considerable diversity, with interaction signatures lasting from hours to days, potentially merging with the Type IIn subclass for which longer-duration interaction typically occurs. To tackle this growing sample of transients and to understand the pre-SN mass loss histories of RSGs, we train on the highest quality, spectropolarimetric observations of a young Type IIn SN taken to date: Those of SN1998S at ~5d after explosion. We design an approach based on a combination of radiation hydrodynamics with HERACLES and polarized radiative transfer with CMFGEN and LONG_POL. The adopted asymmetries are based on a latitudinal, depth- and time-independent, scaling of the density of 1D models of SNe II-P/CSM (e.g., model r1w6b with a `wind' mass-loss rate of 0.01Msun/yr used for SN2023ixf). For a pole-to-equator density ratio of five, we find that the polarization reaches, and then remains for days, at a maximum value of 1.0, 1.4, and 1.8% as the CSM extent is changed from 6, to 8 and 10x10^14cm. The polarization is independent of wavelength away from funnel-shaped depolarizations within emission lines. Our models implicate a significant depolarization at line cores, which we use to constrain the interstellar polarization of SN1998S. Our 2D, prolate ejecta models with moderate asymmetry match well the spectropolarimetric observations of SN1998S at 5d, supporting a polarization level of about ~2%. This study provides a framework for interpreting future spectropolarimetric observations of SNe II-P/CSM and SNe IIn and fostering a better understanding of the origin of their pre-SN mass loss.

 - **Abstract**
 We simulate mergers between star clusters embedded within their natal giant molecular cloud. We extract initial conditions from cloud-scale simulations of cluster formation and introduce different prescriptions for primordial binaries. We find that simulations that do not include primordial binaries result in a larger fraction of unbound stars than simulations which include a prescription for binaries based on observations. We also find a preferred direction of motion for stars that become unbound during the merger. Sub-cluster mergers within realistic gas environments promote binary disruption while mergers between idealized, gas-rich spherical clusters do not produce the same disruption. Binary systems with smaller semi-major axes are disrupted in simulations of sub-cluster mergers within their natal environment compared to simulations that do not include the realistic gas environment. We conclude that binary disruption and the production of an anisotropic distribution of unbound stars are the natural consequences of sub-cluster mergers during star cluster assembly.

 - **Abstract**
 The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is an irregular dwarf galaxy that has recently undergone an interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud. The young massive stars in the SMC formed in the disturbed low-metallicity environment are important targets in astrophysics. We present a catalog of $\sim$ 76,800 far ultraviolet (FUV) sources towards the SMC detected using the Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat. We created an FUV catalog with $\sim$ 62900 probable SMC members which predominantly comprise main-sequence, giant, and subgiant stars. We selected 4 young populations (Young 1, Young 2, Young 3, and Blue Loop (BL) stars) identified from the Gaia optical color-magnitude diagram to study the morphology and kinematics of the young SMC using this catalog. We detect a clumpy morphology with a broken bar, a shell-like structure, and the inner SMC Wing for the 4 stellar populations. The eastern region and the northeastern regions are mainly populated by Young 1, 2, and 3. The central region predominantly has the Young 2 and 3 populations, whereas the SW has BL stars, Young 2 and 3. The 2-D kinematic study using proper motion (PM) reveals that Young 2 and 3 populations show two kinematically distinct sub-populations with low and high PM dispersion, whereas the Young 1 and BL stars show two kinematically distinct populations with low dispersion. Our analysis points to a kinematic disturbance along the RA direction for stars younger than $\sim$ 150 Myr located in the eastern region, with no significant disturbance along the Declination.
#### Planet Mass and Metallicity: The Exoplanets and Solar System Connection

 - **Abstract**
 Theoretical studies of giant planet formation suggest that substantial quantities of metals - elements heavier than hydrogen and helium - can be delivered by solid accretion during the envelope-assembly phase. This metal enhancement process is believed to diminish as a function of planet mass, leading to predictions for a mass-metallicity relationship. This picture is supported by the abundance of CH$_4$ in solar system giant planets, which is unaffected by condensation, unlike H$_2$O. However, all of the solar system giants exhibit some evidence for stratification of metals outside of their cores. In this context, two fundamental questions are whether metallicity of giant planets inferred from observations of the outer envelope layers represents their bulk metallicities, and if not, how are metals distributed within these planets. Comparing the mass-metallicity relationship inferred for solar system giants with various tracers of exoplanet metallicity has yielded a range of results. There is evidence of a solar-system-like mass-metallicity trend using bulk density estimates of exoplanets. However, transit-spectroscopy-based tracers of exoplanet metallicity, which probe only the outer layers of the envelope, are less clear about a mass-metallicity trend and radial composition gradients. The large number of known exoplanets enables statistical characterization. We develop a formalism for comparing both the metallicity inferred for the outer envelope and the metallicity inferred using the bulk density and show this combination may offer insights into metal stratification within planetary envelopes. Thus, future exoplanet observations with JWST and Ariel will be able to shed light on the conditions governing radial composition gradients in exoplanets and, perhaps, provide information about the factors controlling stratification and convection in our solar system gas giants.
#### Learning from core-collapse supernova remnants on the explosion mechanism

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the recently solidified notion that the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) is the primary explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), I estimate some typical properties of the jittering jets. From the imprints of jittering jets in the outskirts of some CCSN remnants, I estimate the half-opening angles of jittering jets that shape CCSN remnants to be ~1-10 degrees. I also estimate that intermittent accretion disks around the newly born neutron star (NS) can launch jets after they live for only several times their orbital period around the NS. To operate, the JJEM requires the intermittent accretion disks that launch the jets to amplify the magnetic fields in a dynamo and the magnetic fields to reconnect to release their energy rapidly. I estimate the width of magnetic field reconnection zones to be ~0.005r~0.1km near the surface of the NS. This width requires a numerical resolution several times smaller than the resolution of present CCSN simulations. I argue, therefore, that existing simulations of the CCSN explosion mechanism are still far from correctly simulating CCSN explosions.
#### Interstellar Glycolaldehyde, Methyl Formate, and Acetic Acid. II. Chemical Modeling of the Bimodal Abundance Pattern in NGC 6334I

 - **Abstract**
 Gas-phase abundance ratios between \ce{C2H4O2} isomers methyl formate (MF), glycolaldehyde (GA), and acetic acid (AA) are typically on the order of 100:10:1 in star-forming regions. However, an unexplained divergence from this neat relationship was recently observed towards a collection of sources in the massive protocluster NGC 6334I; some sources exhibited extreme MF:GA ratios, producing a bimodal behavior between different sources, while the MF:AA ratio remained stable. Here, we use a three-phase gas-grain hot-core chemical model to study the effects of a large parameter space on the simulated \ce{C2H4O2} abundances. A combination of high gas densities and long timescales during ice-mantle desorption ($\sim$125--160~K) appears to be the physical cause of the high MF:GA ratios. The main chemical mechanism for GA destruction occurring under these conditions is the rapid adsorption and reaction of atomic H with GA on the ice surfaces before it has time to desorb. The different binding energies of MF and GA on water ice are crucial to the selectivity of the surface destruction mechanism; individual MF molecules rapidly escape the surface when exposed by water loss, while GA lingers and is destroyed by H. Moderately elevated cosmic-ray ionization rates can increase absolute levels of COM production in the ices and increase the MF:GA ratio, but extreme values are destructive for gas-phase COMs. We speculate that the high densities required for extreme MF:GA ratios could be evidence of COM emission dominated by COMs desorbing within a circumstellar disk.
