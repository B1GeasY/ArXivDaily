#### Physical Correlations and Predictions Emerging from Modern Core-Collapse  Supernova Theory

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we derive correlations between core-collapse supernova observables and progenitor core structures that emerge from our suite of twenty state-of-the-art 3D core-collapse supernova simulations carried to late times. This is the largest such collection of 3D supernova models ever generated and allows one to witness and derive testable patterns that might otherwise be obscured when studying one or a few models in isolation. From this panoramic perspective, we have discovered correlations between explosion energy, neutron star gravitational birth masses, $^{56}$Ni and $\alpha$-rich freeze-out yields, and pulsar kicks and theoretically important correlations with the compactness parameter of progenitor structure. We find a correlation between explosion energy and progenitor mantle binding energy, suggesting that such explosions are self-regulating. We also find a testable correlation between explosion energy and measures of explosion asymmetry, such as the ejecta energy and mass dipoles. While the correlations between two observables are roughly independent of the progenitor ZAMS mass, the many correlations we derive with compactness can not unambiguously be tied to a particular progenitor ZAMS mass. This relationship depends upon the compactness/ZAMS mass mapping associated with the massive star progenitor models employed. Therefore, our derived correlations between compactness and observables may be more robust than with ZAMS mass, but can nevertheless be used in the future once massive star modeling has converged.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the numerical performance of a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) hydrodynamics implementation when applied to the problem of driven, isothermal supersonic turbulence. While the high-order element-based spectral approach of DG is known to efficiently produce accurate results for smooth problems (exponential convergence with expansion order), physical discontinuities in solutions, like shocks, prove challenging and may significantly diminish DG's applicability to practical astrophysical applications. We consider whether DG is able to retain its accuracy and stability for highly supersonic turbulence, characterized by a network of shocks. We find that our new implementation, which regularizes shocks at sub-cell resolution with artificial viscosity, still performs well compared to standard second-order schemes for moderately high Mach number turbulence, provided we also employ an additional projection of the primitive variables onto the polynomial basis to regularize the extrapolated values at cell interfaces. However, the accuracy advantage of DG diminishes significantly in the highly supersonic regime. Nevertheless, in turbulence simulations with a wide dynamic range that start with supersonic Mach numbers and can resolve the sonic point, the low numerical dissipation of DG schemes still proves advantageous in the subsonic regime. Our results thus support the practical applicability of DG schemes for demanding astrophysical problems that involve strong shocks and turbulence, such as star formation in the interstellar medium. We also discuss the substantial computational cost of DG when going to high order, which needs to be weighted against the resulting accuracy gain. For problems containing shocks, this favours the use of comparatively low DG order.
#### JOYS: MIRI/MRS spectroscopy of gas-phase molecules from the high-mass  star-forming region IRAS 23385+6053

 - **Abstract**
 Space-based mid-IR spectroscopy provides tracers of warm gas in star-forming regions that are inaccessible from the ground. Past mid-IR spectra of bright high-mass protostars in the hot-core phase typically showed strong absorption features from molecules such as CO$_2$, C$_2$H$_2$, and HCN. However, little is known about their fainter counterparts at earlier stages. We thus aim to characterize the gas-phase molecular features in JWST MIRI/MRS observations of the young high-mass star-forming region IRAS 23385+6053. Spectra were extracted from two mid-IR sources and three H$_2$ bright outflow knots in the MIRI/MRS field of view. Rich molecular spectra with emission from CO, H$_2$, HD, H$_2$O, C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, CO$_2$, and OH are detected towards the two mid-IR sources. However, only CO and OH are seen towards the brightest H$_2$ knots, suggesting that the majority of the observed species are associated with disks or hot core regions rather than outflows. Simple Local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) slab models were used to fit the observed molecular features. The LTE model fits to $^{12}$CO$_{2}$, C$_{2}$H$_{2}$, and HCN emission suggest warm $120-200$ K emission arising from a disk surface around one or both protostars. Weak $\sim500$ K H$_2$O emission at $\sim$ 6-7 $\mu$m is detected towards one mid-IR source, whereas $250-1050$ K H$_2$O absorption is found in the other. The H$_2$O absorption may occur in the disk atmosphere due to strong accretion-heating of the midplane, or in a disk wind viewed at an ideal angle for absorption. CO emission may originate in the hot inner disk or outflow shocks. OH emission is likely excited in a non-LTE manner through water photodissociation or chemical formation. The observations are consistent with disks having already formed in the young IRAS 23385+6053 system, but further observations are needed to disentangle the effects of geometry and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Oscillation modes of a mixed character are able to probe the inner region of evolved low-mass stars and offer access to a range of information, in particular, the mean core rotation. Ensemble asteroseismology observations are then able to provide clear views on the transfer of angular momentum when stars evolve as red giants. Previous catalogs of core rotation rates in evolved low-mass stars have focussed on hydrogen-shell burning stars. Our aim is to complete the compilation of rotation measurements toward more evolved stages, with a detailed analysis of the mean core rotation in core-helium burning giants. The asymptotic expansion for dipole mixed modes allows us to fit oscillation spectra of red clump stars and derive their core rotation rates. We used a range of prior seismic analyses, complete with new data, to get statistically significant results. We measured the mean core rotation rates for more than 1500 red clump stars. We find that the evolution of the core rotation rate in core-helium-burning stars scales with the inverse square of the stellar radius, with a small dependence on mass. Assuming the conservation of the global angular momentum, a simple model allows us to infer that the mean core rotation and envelope rotation are necessarily coupled. The coupling mechanism ensures that the differential rotation in core-helium-burning red giants is locked.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the implementation of a score-matching neural network that represents a data-driven prior for non-parametric galaxy morphologies. The gradients of this prior can be included in the optimization routine of the recently developed multi-band modeling framework Scarlet2, a redesign of the Scarlet method currently employed as deblender in the pipelines of the HyperSuprimeCam survey and the Rubin Observatory. The addition of the prior avoids the requirement of nondifferentiable constraints, which can lead to convergence failures we discovered in Scarlet. We present the architecture and training details of our score-matching neural network and show with simulated Rubin-like observations that Scarlet2 outperforms Scarlet in accuracy of total flux and morphology estimates, while maintaining excellent performance for colors. We also demonstrate significant improvements in the robustness to inaccurate initializations. Scarlet2 is written in python, extendend by JAX and equinox, and is fully GPU compatible. The implementation and data package of the score model are publicly available at https://github.com/pmelchior/scarlet2.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal loops serve as the fundamental building blocks of the solar corona. Therefore, comprehending their properties is essential in unraveling the dynamics of the Sun's upper atmosphere. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of the morphology and dynamics of a coronal loop observed from two different spacecraft: the High Resolution Imager (HRI$_{EUV}$) of the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager aboard the Solar Orbiter and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. These spacecraft were separated by 43$^{\circ}$ during this observation. The main findings of this study are: (1) The observed loop exhibits similar widths in both the HRI$_{EUV}$ and AIA data, suggesting that the cross-sectional shape of the loop is circular; (2) The loop maintains a uniform width along its entire length, supporting the notion that coronal loops do not exhibit expansion; (3) Notably, the loop undergoes unconventional dynamics, including thread separation and abrupt downward movement. Intriguingly, these dynamic features also appear similar in data from both spacecraft. Although based on observation of a single loop, these results raise questions about the validity of the coronal veil hypothesis and underscore the intricate and diverse nature of complexity within coronal loops.

 - **Abstract**
 Shock boundary layers are regions bounded by a shock wave on the one side and tangential discontinuity on the other side. These boundary layers are commonly observed in astrophysics. For example, they exist in the regions of the interaction of the stellar winds with the surrounding interstellar medium. Additionally, the shock layers are often penetrated by the flows of interstellar atoms, as, for instance, in the astrospheres of the stars embedded by the partially ionized interstellar clouds. This paper presents a simple toy model of a shock layer that aims to qualitatively describe the influence of charge exchange with interstellar hydrogen atoms on the plasma flow in astrospheric shock layers. To clearly explore this effect, magnetic fields are neglected, and the geometry is kept as simple as possible. The model explains why the cooling of plasma due to charge exchange in the inner heliosheath leads to an increase in plasma density in front of the heliopause. It also demonstrates that the source of momentum causes changes in the pressure profile within the shock layer. The paper also discusses the decrease in plasma density near the astropause in the outer shock layer in the case of layer heating, which is particularly relevant in light of the Voyager measurements in the heliospheric shock layer.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-mass stars belonging to the M spectral type are the most numerous stars in our Galaxy, amounting to about two-thirds in number, and are found at the bottom of the main sequence in the H-R diagram. %Multi-wavelength studies on star-forming regions help to understand the census of PMS stars, their formation process, and the interaction of expanding H II regions harboring massive stars with their natal molecular clouds. Photometric studies of low-mass stars, including brown dwarfs (BDs), provide several important evolutions of their atmosphere, magnetic flares and chromospheric activity. This paper highlights a few interesting results from our optical I-band observations of 2MASS J03435638+3209591 in the young star-forming IC~348 region and three BDs in Taurus star-forming regions using ground-based telescopes as well as a space-based telescope. We estimated the fast periodicities in the range of 1.5 to 3 hours in Taurus BDs. Furthermore, using the long-term photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we have conducted a time-resolved variability analysis of CFHT-BD-Tau 4. The periodogram analysis of TESS data reveals an orbital period of $\sim$ 3 days. We found two flare events in TESS sector 43 data for this BD and estimated the flared energies as $4.59\times10^{35}$ erg and $2.64\times10^{36}$ erg, which sit in the superflare range.
#### Formation of long-period post-common-envelope binaries I. No extra  energy is needed to explain oxygen-neon white dwarfs paired with AFGK-type  main-sequence stars

 - **Abstract**
 In this first of a series of papers related to long-period post-common-envelope (CE) binaries, we investigated whether extra energy is required or not to explain the currently known post-CE binaries with sufficiently long orbital periods consisting of oxygen-neon white dwarfs with AFGK-type main-sequence star companions. We carried out binary population simulations with the BSE code and searched for their formation pathways. Unlike what has been claimed for a long time, we show that all such post-CE binaries can be explained by assuming inefficient CE evolution, which is consistent with results achieved for the remaining post-CE binaries. There is therefore no need for an extra energy source. We also found that for CE efficiency close to 100%, post-CE binaries hosting oxygen-neon white dwarfs with orbital periods as long as a thousand days can be explained. For all known systems we found formation pathways consisting of CE evolution triggered when a highly evolved (i.e. the envelope mass being comparable to the core mass) thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch star fills its Roche lobe at an orbital period of several thousand days. Due to the sufficiently low envelope mass and sufficiently long orbital period, the resulting post-CE orbital period can easily be several tens of days. We conclude that the known post-CE binaries with oxygen-neon white dwarfs and AFGK-type main-sequence stars can be explained without invoking any energy source other than orbital and thermal energy. Our results strengthen the idea that the most common formation pathway of the overall population of post-CE binaries hosting white dwarfs is through inefficient CE evolution.
#### Hunting young stars in the Galactic centre. Hundreds of thousands of  solar masses of young stars in the Sagittarius C region

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic centre stands out as the most prolific star-forming environment of the Galaxy when averaged over volume. In the last 30 million years, it has witnessed the formation of $\sim10^6 M_\odot$ of stars. However, crowding and high extinction hamper their detection and, up to now, only a small fraction of the expected mass of young stars has been identified. We aim to detect hidden young stars at the Galactic centre by analysing the stellar population in Sagittarius (Sgr) C. This is a region at the western edge of the nuclear stellar disc whose HII emission makes it a perfect candidate to host young stars. We built dereddened luminosity functions for Sgr C and a control field in the central region of the nuclear stellar disc, and fitted them with a linear combination of theoretical models to analyse their stellar population. We find that Sgr C hosts several $10^5 M_\odot$ of young stars. We compared our results with the recently discovered young stellar population in Sgr B1, which is situated at the opposite edge of the nuclear stellar disc. We estimated that the Sgr C young stars are $\sim20$ Myr old, and likely show the next evolutionary step of the slightly younger stars in Sgr B1. Our findings contribute to addressing the discrepancy between the expected and the detected number of young stars in the Galactic centre, and shed light on their evolution in this extreme environment. As a secondary result, we find an intermediate-age stellar population in Sgr C ($\sim50$ % of its stellar mass with an age of between 2 and 7 Gyr), which is not present in the innermost regions of the nuclear stellar disc (dominated by stars >7 Gyr). This supports the existence of an age gradient and favours an inside-out formation of the nuclear stellar disc.

 - **Abstract**
 Propagation effects are one of the main sources of noise in high-precision pulsar timing. For pulsars below an ecliptic latitude of $5^\circ$, the ionised plasma in the solar wind can introduce dispersive delays of order 100 microseconds around solar conjunction at an observing frequency of 300 MHz. A common approach to mitigate this assumes a spherical solar wind with a time-constant amplitude. However, this has been shown to be insufficient to describe the solar wind. We present a linear, Gaussian-process piecewise Bayesian approach to fit a spherical solar wind of time-variable amplitude, which has been implemented in the pulsar software run_enterprise. Through simulations, we find that the current EPTA+InPTA data combination is not sensitive to such variations; however, solar wind variations will become important in the near future with the addition of new InPTA data and data collected with the low-frequency LOFAR telescope. We also compare our results for different high-precision timing datasets (EPTA+InPTA, PPTA, and LOFAR) of three millisecond pulsars (J0030$+$0451, J1022$+$1001, J2145$-$0450), and find that the solar-wind amplitudes are generally consistent for any individual pulsar, but they can vary from pulsar to pulsar. Finally, we compare our results with those of an independent method on the same LOFAR data of the three millisecond pulsars. We find that differences between the results of the two methods can be mainly attributed to the modelling of dispersion variations in the interstellar medium, rather than the solar wind modelling.
#### α-element enhancements in the Magellanic Interstellar Medium:  evidence for recent star formation

 - **Abstract**
 Important questions on the chemical composition of the neutral ISM in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) are still open. It is usually assumed that their metallicity is uniform and equal to that measured in hot stars and HII regions, but direct measurements on the neutral ISM have not been performed until now. Deriving the metallicity from the observed metal abundances is not straightforward because they also depend on the depletion of metals into dust as well as nucleosynthesis effects such as $\alpha$-element enhancement. We collect literature column densities of TiII, NiII, CrII, FeII, MnII, SiII, CuII, MgII, SII, PII, ZnII, and OI in the neutral ISM towards 32 and 22 hot stars in the LMC and SMC. We measure the metallicity, dust depletion, and $\alpha$-element enhancements in the neutral ISM in the LMC and SMC. We find $\alpha$-element enhancements in the neutral ISM in most systems, on average 0.26 dex (0.35 dex) for the LMC (SMC), and Mn under-abundance in the SMC (on average $-0.35$ dex). These are higher than for stars at similar metallicities. The observed $\alpha$-element enhancements and Mn under-abundance are likely due to bursts of star formation, more recently than ~1 Gyr ago, that enriched the ISM from core-collapse supernovae. We find total neutral ISM metallicities that are mostly consistent with hot stars metallicity, on average [M/H]$_{\rm tot} = -0.33$ ($-0.83$), in the LMC (SMC). In six systems, however, we find significantly lower metallicities, two out of 32 in the LMC (with ~16% solar) and four out of 22 in the SMC (3 and 10% solar), two of which are in the outskirts of the SMC near the Magellanic Bridge, a region known for having a lower metallicity. With the exception of lines of sight towards the Magellanic Bridge, the neutral gas in the LMC and SMC appears fairly well mixed in terms of metallicity. [abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 The precise origin of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is unknown despite their value to numerous areas in astronomy. While it is a long-standing consensus that they arise from an explosion of a carbon/oxygen white dwarf, the exact progenitor configurations and explosion mechanisms that lead to SNe Ia are still debated. One popular theory is the double detonation in which a helium layer, accreted from a binary companion, detonates on the surface of the primary star, leading to a converging shock-induced detonation of the underlying core. It has recently been seen in simulations that a helium-rich degenerate companion may undergo its own explosion triggered by the impact from the ejecta of the primary star. We show 2D simulations that model a white dwarf undergoing a double detonation which triggers the explosion of the degenerate companion, leading to either a triple or quadruple detonation. We also present the first multi-dimensional radiative transfer results from the triple and quadruple detonation scenario. We find that within a range of mass configurations of the degenerate binary, the synthetic light curves and spectra of these events match observations as well as theoretical models of isolated double detonations do. Notably, double and quadruple detonations that are spectrally similar and reach the same peak brightnesses have drastically different ejection masses and produce different amounts of Si- and Fe-group elements. Further understanding of this scenario is needed in order to determine if at least some observed SNe Ia actually originate from two stars exploding.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies of supernova remnants (SNRs) have revealed that some SNRs exhibit a neutral iron line emission at 6.4 keV. This line has been proposed to originate from the interaction of high-energy particles formed in the SNR shell with the surrounding cold matter. We searched for the neutral iron line emission in the SNR W49B. Significant detection of the 6.4 keV line is found in the northwest region, close to the molecular cloud interacting with the SNR shell. In addition, an excess emission at 8-9 keV, in which K_gamma, K_delta, and K_epsilon lines of He-like iron exist, is also significantly found in the region where the radio shell is not bright. We discuss the origin of the 6.4 keV line and the excess emission at 8-9 keV.

 - **Abstract**
 The shear and interface modes excited inside the neutron star due to the presence of elasticity depend on the properties of both the crust and core region. To examine how such eigenfrequencies depend on the neutron star properties, we solve the eigenvalue problem by adopting the relativistic Cowling approximation. Then, we confirm that the number of the interface modes excited in the star is generally equivalent to the number of the interface where the shear modulus discontinuously becomes zero, but we also find that the number of interface modes becomes smaller than that of the interface for the stellar model with lower or higher value of the slope parameter $L$. Furthermore, we derive the empirical relations for expressing the shear modes and one of the interface modes ($i_1$-mode in the text), which is the mode whose amplitude becomes dominant at the interface between the crust and envelopes and at the interface between the phases of slablike and cylindrical nuclei. At the end, we also show the possibility of identifying the higher QPO frequencies observed in GRB 200415A with the shear oscillations, as an alternative possibility instead of the torsional oscillations.

Against the continuum of an M spectral type star about 50 emission lines of allowed (HI, HeI, NaI, SII) and forbidden (OI, OII, OIII, NI, NII, SII, CaII, FeII, NiII) transitions were identified. It was found that from the autumn of 2020 to the beginning of 2023, the brightness of the star in the visible region decreased $(\Delta I \approx 1.5^m),$ and then began to return to initial level. As the visible brightness of the star declined, its colour indices decreased in the visible region, but increased in the near-IR bands. At light minimum, the degree of polarization in the $I$ band reached $\approx$ 13%, and the equivalent widths of e.g. the H$\alpha$ and [SII] 6731 A lines increased to 376 and 79 A, respectively. Arguments are given in favour of ZZ Tau IRS being a UX Ori type star, and its variability being due to eclipses by dust clouds, which are inhomogeneities in the dusty disc wind. Forbidden lines are formed both in the disc wind and in the jet, the axis of which is oriented along PA$=61\pm 3$ degrees. The jet mass-loss rate is $>5 \times 10^{-10}$ M$_\odot$/yr, what is abnormally large for a star with a mass of $<0.3$ M$_\odot.$ Apparently, the disc wind of ZZ Tau IRS is not axially symmetric, probably due to the azimuthal asymmetry of the protoplanetary disc found earlier from ALMA observations.

 Massive and luminous O-star atmospheres with winds have been studied primarily using one-dimensional (1D), spherically symmetric, and stationary models. However, observations and theory rather suggest that O-star atmospheres are highly structured, turbulent, and time-dependent. As such, when comparing to observations, present-day 1D modeling tools need to introduce ad-hoc quantities such as photospheric macro & microturbulence, wind clumping, etc. We present multi-dimensional, time-dependent, radiation-hydrodynamical (RHD) simulations for O-stars that encapsulate the deeper sub-surface envelope (down to T ~ 450 kK) as well as the supersonic line-driven wind outflow in one unified approach. Time-dependent, two-dimensional (2D) simulations of O-star atmospheres with winds are performed using a flux-limiting RHD finite volume modeling technique. Opacities are computed using a hybrid approach combining tabulated Rosseland means with calculations (based on the Sobolev approximation) of the enhanced line opacities expected for supersonic flows. When compared to 1D models, the average structures in the 2D simulations display less envelope expansion, no sharp density-inversions, density and temperature profiles that are significantly less steep around the photosphere, and a strong anti-correlation between velocity and density in the supersonic wind. To qualitatively match the different density and temperature profiles seen in our multi-D and 1D models, we need to add a modest amount of convective energy transport in the deep sub-surface layers and a large turbulent pressure around the photosphere to the 1D models.

 - **Abstract**
 The rotational mass loss has been realized to be a prevalent mechanism to produce low-speed debris near the asteroid, and the size composition of the asteroid's surface regolith has been closely measured by in situ explorations. However, the full-scale evolution of the shedding debris has not been examined using the observed particle sizes, which may hold vital clues to the initial growth of an asteroid moonlet, and help us to understand the general mechanisms that dominate the formation of asteroid systems. This paper presented our study on the cumulative evolution of the debris cloud formed by a rotationally unstable asteroid. A semi-analytical model is developed to characterize the spatial-temporal evolution of the debris cloud posterior to a shedding event. Large-scale DEM simulations are performed to quantify the clustering behavior of the debris particles in the mechanical environment near the asteroid. As a result, we found the cumulation of a steady debris cloud is dominated by large pieces of debris, and the shedding particles follow a common migration trend, which fundamentally determines the mass distribution of the debris cloud. For the accretion analysis, we sketched the life cycle of a debris cluster, and showed its dependency on particle size. The DEM simulations adopt physical parameters estimated from observations and asteroid missions. The results confirm porous fluffy cluster structures can form shortly after a shedding event of observed magnitude. Measurements to these structures show they possess certain strength and adsorption capacity to collisions from dissociative debris particles.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent gravitational wave events have suggested the existence of near-solar-mass black holes which cannot be formed via stellar evolution. This has opened up a tantalizing possibility of future detections of both black holes and naked singularities in this mass range. Existence of naked singularities is a topical and fundamental physics issue, but their formation mechanism is not yet clear. Here, we show that some white dwarfs can realistically transmute into black holes and naked singularities with a wide range of near- and sub-solar-mass values by capturing asymmetric or non-self-annihilating primordial dark matter (PDM) particles. We argue that, while a type Ia supernova due to the accumulation of dark matter at the core of a white dwarf could also be a possibility, the transmutation of a white dwarf into a black hole or a naked singularity is a viable consequence of the capture of non-self-annihilating PDM particles. These white dwarf transmutations can have a significant role in probing the physics of dark matter and compact objects, and could be tested using the rates and locations of mergers over the cosmological time scale.
