 - **Abstract**
 Identifying infall motions is crucial for our understanding of accretion processes in regions of star formation. The NH3 (1,1) hyperfine intensity anomaly (HIA) has been proposed to be a readily usable tracer for such infall motions in star-forming regions harboring young stellar objects at very early evolutionary stages. In this paper, we seek to study the HIA toward fifteen infall candidate regions to assess its reliability as an infall tracer. By using deep observations of the NH3 (1,1) transition with the Effelsberg 100 m telescope, HIAs have been identified toward all the targets. Fourteen out of fifteen sources exhibit anomalous intensities either in the inner or outer satellite lines. All the derived HIAs conform to the framework of the existing two models, namely, hyperfine selective trapping (HST) and systematic contraction or expansion motion (CE) models. In our sample of infall candidates, a majority of the HIAs remain consistent with the HST model. Only in three targets, the HIAs are consistent with infall motions under the CE model. Thus HIAs could be used as an infall tracer but seem not highly sensitive to infall motions in our single-dish data. Nevertheless, the emission could be blended with emission from outflow activities. HIAs consistent with the HST model show stronger anomalies with increasing kinetic temperatures (Tk), which is expected by the HST model. On the other hand, HIAs consistent with infall motions show little dependence on Tk. Therefore, HIAs may preferably trace infall of cold gas.

 - **Abstract**
 Spitzer 'hidden' observations of the background are used to construct a catalog of 4,090 spectra and examine the signature of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules and their connection to extinction by dust. A strong positive correlation is recovered between WISE12, E(B-V), and the 11.2 $\mu$m PAH band. For 0.06 $\leq$ E(B-V) $\leq$ 5.0, correlations of the 6.2, 11.2, and 12.7 $\mu$m PAH band are positive with E(B-V). Three dust temperature regimes are revealed. Correlations with WISE12 are well-constrained and that with 12.7/11.2 is flat. Decomposition with the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database reveals a tentative positive correlation between the 6.2/11.2 and the PAH ionization fraction, while that with 12.7/11.2 is slightly negative, suggesting PAH structural changes. The relation with PAH size and 6.2/11.2 is negative, while that with 12.7/11.2 is positive. Averaging spectra into five E(B-V) and three T$_{\rm dust}$ bins shows an evolution in PAH emission and variations in 12.7/11.2. Database-fits show an increase in $f_{\rm i}$ and the PAH ionization parameter $\gamma$, but a more stable large PAH fraction. While the largest $\gamma$s are associated with the highest T$_{\rm dust}$, there is no one-to-one correlation. The analysis is hampered by low-quality data at short wavelengths. There are indications that PAHs in the more-diffuse backgrounds behave differently from those in the general interstellar medium. However, they are often still associated with larger scale filamentary cloud-like structures. The spectra and auxiliary data have been made available through the Ames Background Interstellar Medium Spectral Catalog and may guide JWST programs.

 - **Abstract**
 Most stars are born in the crowded environments of gradually forming star clusters. Dynamical interactions between close-passing stars and the evolving UV radiation fields from proximate massive stars are expected to sculpt the protoplanetary discs in these clusters, potentially contributing to the diversity of planetary systems that we observe. Here, we investigate the impact of cluster environment on disc demographics by implementing simple protoplanetary disc evolution models within $N$-body simulations of gradual star cluster formation. We consider a range of star formation efficiency per free-fall time, $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$, and mass surface density of the natal cloud environment, $\Sigma_{\rm cl}$, both of which affect the overall duration of cluster formation. We track the interaction history of all stars to estimate the dynamical truncation of the discs around stars involved in close encounters. We also track external photoevaporation of the discs due to the ionizing radiation field of the nearby high- and intermediate-mass ($> 5 M_\odot$) stars. We find that $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$, $\Sigma_{\rm cl}$, and the degree of primordial binarity have major influences on the masses and radii of the disc population. In particular, external photo-evaporation has a greater impact than dynamical interactions in determining the fate of discs in our clusters.
#### Rotationally inelastic rate coefficients for C$_7$N$^{-}$ and C$_{10}$H$^{-}$ anions in collision with H$_2$ at interstellar conditions

 - **Abstract**
 The anions C$_7$N$^-$ and C$_{10}$H$^-$ are the two longest of the linear (C,N)-bearing and (C,H)-bearing chains which have so far been detected in the Interstellar Medium. In order to glean information on their collision-induced rotational state-changing processes, we analyse the general features of new ab initio potentials describing the interaction of both linear anions with H$_2$, one of the most abundant partners in their ISM environment. We employ an artificial neural network fit of the reduced-dimensionality potential energy surface for C$_7$N$^-$...H$_2$ interaction and discuss in detail the spatial features in terms of multipolar radial coefficients. For the C$_{10}$H$^-$...H$_2$ interaction we use the initial grid of two dimensional raw points to generate by quadrature the Legendre expansion directly, further including the long-range terms as discussed in the main text. Quantum scattering calculations are employed to obtain rotationally inelastic cross sections, for collision energies in the range of 10$^{-4}$ to 400 cm$^{-1}$. From them we generate the corresponding inelastic rate coefficients as a function of temperature covering the range from 10 to 50 K. The results for the rate coefficients for the longest cyanopolyyne are compared with the earlier results obtained for the smaller terms of the same series, also in collision with H$_2$. We obtain that the inelastic rate coefficients for the long linear anions are all fairly large compared with the earlier systems. The consequences of such findings on their non-equilibrium rotational populations in interstellar environments are illustrated in our conclusions.
#### Analytic insight into the physics of SASI I. Shock instability in a non-rotating stellar core

 - **Abstract**
 During the core collapse of a massive star just before its supernova explosion, the amplification of asymmetric motions by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) imprints on the neutrino flux and the gravitational waves a frequency signature carrying direct information on the explosion process. The physical interpretation of this multi-messenger signature requires a detailed understanding of the instability mechanism. A perturbative analysis is used to characterize the properties of SASI, and assess the effect of the region of neutronization above the surface of the proto-neutron star. The eigenfrequencies of the most unstable modes are compared to those obtained in an adiabatic approximation where neutrino interactions are neglected above the neutrinosphere. The differential system is solved analytically using a Wronskian method and approximated asymptotically for a large shock radius. The oscillation period of SASI is well fitted with a simple analytic function of the shock radius, the radius of maximum deceleration and the mass of the proto-neutron star. The oscillation period is weakly dependent on the parametrized cooling function which however affects the SASI growth rate. The general properties of SASI eigenmodes are described using an adiabatic model. In this approximation the eigenvalue problem is formulated as a self-forced oscillator. The forcing agent is the radial advection of baroclinic vorticity perturbations and entropy perturbations produced by the shock oscillation. The differential system defining the eigenfrequencies is reduced to a single integral equation. Its analytical approximation sheds light on the radially extended character of the region of advective-acoustic coupling. The simplicity of this adiabatic formalism opens new perspectives to investigate the effect of stellar rotation and non-adiabatic processes on SASI.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the last few decades, radio detection has become one of the standard techniques to study high-energy cosmic-ray air showers. For the purpose of analysing the data, we heavily rely on Monte Carlo simulations. Upcoming dense radio array experiments such as LOFAR2.0 and SKA will, however, reach the limit of what is computationally feasible with these. Other techniques are available, based on macroscopic quantities, but their accuracy has thus far not been adequate to use them in precision analyses. In this contribution we present the latest update on the template synthesis approach, a hybrid model using both micro- and macroscopic inputs to synthesise the radio emission for an air shower with an arbitrary longitudinal profile. The method starts from the emission of a given shower and employs semi-analytical relations which only depend on the atmospheric depth at shower maximum and antenna position in order to transform it. Core to the template synthesis approach is the slicing of the atmosphere. By considering the radio emission from each slice separately, we only need to explicitly account for shower age effects. In previous work it was shown this could be done over a wide range of primary energy and across primary types for vertical air showers, with an accuracy of 10%. Here, we generalise the method to other zenith angles. We investigate the potential to synthesise between different geometries using a data set consisting of several hundreds of CORSIKA showers with primary energies ranging from $10^{17}$ eV to $10^{19}$ eV.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel way to synthesise the radio emission from extensive air showers. It is a hybrid approach which uses a single microscopic Monte-Carlo simulation to generate the radio emission from a shower with a different longitudinal evolution, primary particle type and energy. The method employs semi-analytical relations which only depend on the shower parameters to transform the radio signal in the simulated antennas. We apply this method to vertical air showers with energies ranging from $10^{17}$ eV to $10^{19}$ eV and compare the results with CoREAS using two different metrics. In order to gauge the performance over our simulation set, we subsequently use every shower in the set as a template to synthesise the emission from the other showers. Depending on the scoring metric, template synthesis reconstructs the radio emission with an accuracy of 5 to 10%.

 - **Abstract**
 In this conference summary I first provide some historical notes on my own collaboration with You-Hua Chu and on the discovery of X-rays from superbubbles by Margarita Rosado S. I then consider the central subject of the conference, stellar feedback, and how interactions between stellar winds and the interstellar medium can limit or enhance the effects of feedback compared to models including only supernova explosions. Finally, I review results in other areas covered by the conference, including planet and star formation, nova and supernova remnants, different topics in stellar evolution and interaction with the interstellar medium, star clusters, observational surveys, and observational and numerical techniques.
