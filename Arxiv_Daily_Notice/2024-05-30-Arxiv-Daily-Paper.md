 - **Abstract**
 There is now abundant observational evidence that star formation is a highly dynamical process that connects filament hierarchies and supernova feedback from galaxy scale kpc filaments and superbubbles, to giant molecular clouds (GMCs) on 100 pc scales and star clusters (1 pc). Here we present galactic multi-scale MHD simulations that track the formation of structure from galactic down to sub pc scales in a magnetized, Milky Way like galaxy undergoing supernova driven feedback processes. We do this by adopting a novel zoom-in technique that follows the evolution of typical 3-kpc sub regions without cutting out the surrounding galactic environment, allowing us to reach 0.28 pc resolution in the individual zoom-in regions. We find a wide range of morphologies and hierarchical structure including superbubbles, turbulence, kpc atomic gas filaments hosting multiple GMC condensations that are often associated with superbubble compression; down to smaller scale filamentary GMCs and star cluster regions within them. Gas accretion and compression ultimately drive filaments over a critical, scale - dependent, line mass leading to gravitational instabilities that produce GMCs and clusters. In quieter regions, galactic shear can produce filamentary GMCs within flattened, rotating disk-like structures on 100 pc scales. Strikingly, our simulations demonstrate the formation of helical magnetic fields associated with the formation of these disk like structures.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate chemical compositions of star-forming regions are a critical diagnostic tool to characterize the star formation history and gas flows which regulate galaxy formation. However, the abundance discrepancy factor (ADF) between measurements from the "direct" optical electron temperature ($T_e$) method and from the recombination lines (RL) represents $\sim0.2$ dex systematic uncertainty in oxygen abundance. The degree of uncertainty for other elements is unknown. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of O$^{++}$ and N$^+$ ion abundances using optical and far-infrared spectra of a star-forming region within the nearby dwarf galaxy Haro 3, which exhibits a typical ADF. Assuming homogeneous conditions, the far-IR emission indicates an O abundance which is higher than the $T_e$ method and consistent with the RL value, as would be expected from temperature fluctuations, whereas the N abundance is too large to be explained by temperature fluctuations. Instead a component of highly obscured gas is likely required to explain the high far-IR to optical flux ratios. Accounting for this obscured component reduces both the IR-based metallicities and the inferred magnitude of temperature fluctuations, such that they cannot fully explain the ADF in Haro 3. Additionally, we find potential issues when predicting the RL fluxes from current atomic data. Our findings underscore the critical importance of resolving the cause of abundance discrepancies and understanding the biases between different metallicity methods. This work represents a promising methodology, and we identify further approaches to address the current dominant uncertainties.
#### Star Stream Velocity Distributions in CDM and WDM Galactic Halos

 - **Abstract**
 The dark matter subhalos orbiting in a galactic halo perturb the orbits of stars in thin stellar streams. Over time the random velocities in the streams develop non-Gaussian wings. The rate of velocity increase is approximately a random walk at a rate proportional to the number of subhalos, primarily those in the mass range $\approx 10^{6-7} M_\odot$. The distribution of random velocities in long, thin, streams is measured in simulated Milky Way-like halos that develop in representative WDM and CDM cosmologies. The radial velocity distributions are well modeled as the sum of a Gaussian and an exponential. The resulting MCMC fits find Gaussian cores of 1-2 km/sec and exponential wings that increase from 3 km/sec for 5.5 keV WDM, 4 km/sec for 7 keV WDM, to 6 km/sec for a CDM halo. The observational prospects to use stream measurements to constrain the nature of galactic dark matter are discussed.
#### Kinetic temperature of massive star-forming molecular clumps measured with formaldehyde V. The massive filament DR21

 - **Abstract**
 The kinetic temperature structure of the massive filament DR21 has been mapped using the IRAM 30 m telescope. This mapping employed the para-H$_2$CO triplet ($J_{\rm K_aK_c}$ = 3$_{03}$--2$_{02}$, 3$_{22}$--2$_{21}$, and 3$_{21}$--2$_{20}$) on a scale of $\sim$0.1 pc. By modeling the averaged line ratios of para-H$_{2}$CO with RADEX under non-LTE assumptions, the kinetic temperature of the dense gas was derived at a density of $n$(H$_{2}$) = 10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$. The para-H$_2$CO lines reveal significantly higher temperatures than NH$_3$ (1,1)/(2,2) and FIR wavelengths. The dense clumps appear to correlate with the notable kinetic temperature. Among the four dense cores (N44, N46, N48, and N54), temperature gradients are observed on a scale of $\sim$0.1-0.3 pc. This suggests that the warm dense gas is influenced by internal star formation activity. With the exception of N54, the temperature profiles of these cores were fitted with power-law indices ranging from $-$0.3 to $-$0.5. This indicates that the warm dense gas is heated by radiation emitted from internally embedded protostar(s) and/or clusters. While there is no direct evidence supporting the idea that the dense gas is heated by shocks resulting from a past explosive event in the DR21 region, our measurements toward the DR21W1 region provide compelling evidence that the dense gas is indeed heated by shocks originating from the western DR21 flow. Higher temperatures appear to be associated with turbulence. The physical parameters of the dense gas in the DR21 filament exhibit a remarkable similarity to the results obtained in OMC-1 and N113. This may imply that the physical mechanisms governing the dynamics and thermodynamics of dense gas traced by H$_{2}$CO in diverse star formation regions may be dominated by common underlying principles despite variations in specific environmental conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated in detail the M5.8 class solar flare that occurred on 2023-03-06. This flare was one of the first strong flares observed by the Siberian Radioheliograph in the microwave range and the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory in the X-ray range. The flare consisted of two separate flaring events (a "thermal" and a "cooler" ones), and was associated with (and probably triggered by) a filament eruption. During the first part of the flare, the microwave emission was produced in an arcade of relatively short and low flaring loops. During the second part of the flare, the microwave emission was produced by energetic electrons trapped near the top of a large-scale flaring loop; the evolution of the trapped electrons was mostly affected by the Coulomb collisions. Using the available observations and the GX Simulator tool, we created a 3D model of the flare, and estimated the parameters of the energetic electrons in it.

 - **Abstract**
 The main science aim of the BlackGEM array is to detect optical counterparts to gravitational wave mergers. Additionally, the array will perform a set of synoptic surveys to detect Local Universe transients and short time-scale variability in stars and binaries, as well as a six-filter all-sky survey down to ~22nd mag. The BlackGEM Phase-I array consists of three optical wide-field unit telescopes. Each unit uses an f/5.5 modified Dall-Kirkham (Harmer-Wynne) design with a triplet corrector lens, and a 65cm primary mirror, coupled with a 110Mpix CCD detector, that provides an instantaneous field-of-view of 2.7~square degrees, sampled at 0.564\arcsec/pixel. The total field-of-view for the array is 8.2 square degrees. Each telescope is equipped with a six-slot filter wheel containing an optimised Sloan set (BG-u, BG-g, BG-r, BG-i, BG-z) and a wider-band 440-720 nm (BG-q) filter. Each unit telescope is independent from the others. Cloud-based data processing is done in real time, and includes a transient-detection routine as well as a full-source optimal-photometry module. BlackGEM has been installed at the ESO La Silla observatory as of October 2019. After a prolonged COVID-19 hiatus, science operations started on April 1, 2023 and will run for five years. Aside from its core scientific program, BlackGEM will give rise to a multitude of additional science cases in multi-colour time-domain astronomy, to the benefit of a variety of topics in astrophysics, such as infant supernovae, luminous red novae, asteroseismology of post-main-sequence objects, (ultracompact) binary stars, and the relation between gravitational wave counterparts and other classes of transients

 Aims. We report the confirmation of a new transiting exoplanet orbiting the star TOI-5076. Methods. We present our vetting procedure and follow-up observations which led to the confirmation of the exoplanet TOI-5076b. In particular, we employed high-precision {\it TESS} photometry, high-angular-resolution imaging from several telescopes, and high-precision radial velocities from HARPS-N. Results. From the HARPS-N spectroscopy, we determined the spectroscopic parameters of the host star: T$\rm_{eff}$=(5070$\pm$143) K, log~g=(4.6$\pm$0.3), [Fe/H]=(+0.20$\pm$0.08), and [$\alpha$/Fe]=0.05$\pm$0.06. The transiting planet is a warm sub-Neptune with a mass m$\rm_p=$(16$\pm$2) M$\rm_{\oplus}$, a radius r$\rm_p=$(3.2$\pm$0.1)~R$\rm_{\oplus}$ yielding a density $\rho_p$=(2.8$\pm$0.5) g cm$^{-3}$. It revolves around its star approximately every 23.445 days. Conclusions. The host star is a metal-rich, K2V dwarf, located at about 82 pc from the Sun with a radius of R$_{\star}$=(0.78$\pm$0.01) R$_{\odot}$ and a mass of M$_{\star}$=(0.80$\pm$0.07) M$_{\odot}$. It forms a common proper motion pair with an M-dwarf companion star located at a projected separation of 2178 au. The chemical analysis of the host-star and the Galactic-space velocities indicate that TOI-5076 belongs to the old population of thin-to-thick-disk transition stars. The density of TOI-5076b suggests the presence of a large fraction by volume of volatiles overlying a massive core. We found that a circular orbit solution is marginally favored with respect to an eccentric orbit solution for TOI-5076b.
#### Probing the strength of radial migration via churning by using metal-rich red giant stars from APOGEE

 - **Abstract**
 Making use of the APOGEE DR17 catalogue with high quality data for 143,509 red giant branch stars we explore the strength of different mechanisms that causes a star to radially migrate in the Milky Way stellar disk. At any position in the disk we find stars that are more metal-rich than the local interstellar medium. This is surprising and normally attributed to the migration of these stars after their formation inside their current Galactocentric-radius. Such stars are prime candidates for studying the strength of different migratory processes. We specifically select two types of metal-rich stars: i) super metal-rich stars ([Fe/H] > 0.2) and ii) stars that are more metal-rich than their local environment. For both, we explore the distribution of orbital parameters and ages as evidence of their migration history. We find that most super metal-rich stars have experienced some amount of churning as they have orbits with Rg >= 5 kpc. Furthermore, about half of the super metal-rich stars are on non-circular orbits (ecc > 0.15) and therefore also have experienced blurring. The metallicity of young stars in our sample is generally the same as the metallicity of the interstellar medium, suggesting they have not radially migrated yet. Stars with lower metallicity than the local environment have intermediate to old ages. We further find that super metal-rich stars have approximately the same age distribution at all Galactocentric-radii, which suggests that radial migration is a key mechanism responsible for the chemical compositions of stellar populations in the Milky Way.
#### Exoplanet Aeronomy: A Case Study of WASP-69b's Variable Thermosphere

 - **Abstract**
 Aeronomy, the study of Earth's upper atmosphere and its interaction with the local space environment, has long traced changes in the thermospheres of Earth and other solar system planets to solar variability in the X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (collectively, "XUV") bands. Extending comparative aeronomy to the short-period extrasolar planets may illuminate whether stellar XUV irradiation powers atmospheric outflows that change planetary radii on astronomical timescales. In recent years, near-infrared transit spectroscopy of metastable HeI has been a prolific tracer of high-altitude planetary gas. We present a case study of exoplanet aeronomy using metastable HeI transit observations from Palomar/WIRC and follow-up high-energy data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory that were taken within one month of the WASP-69 system, a K-type main sequence star with a well-studied hot Jupiter companion. Supplemented by archival data, we find that WASP-69's X-ray flux in 2023 was less than 50% of what was recorded in 2016 and that the metastable HeI absorption from WASP-69b was lower in 2023 versus past epochs from 2017-2019. Via atmospheric modeling, we show that this time-variable metastable HeI signal is in the expected direction given the observed change in stellar XUV, possibly stemming from WASP-69's magnetic activity cycle. Our results underscore the ability of multi-epoch, multi-wavelength observations to paint a cohesive picture of the interaction between an exoplanet's atmosphere and its host star.
#### Metallicity Dependence of Pressure-Regulated Feedback-Modulated Star Formation in the TIGRESS-NCR Simulation Suite

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new suite of numerical simulations of the star-forming interstellar medium (ISM) using the TIGRESS-NCR framework, covering a wide range of galactic conditions including metallicity. The TIGRESS-NCR framework is a model of the ISM in galactic disks that solves ideal MHD equations with self-gravity in a local shearing-box, including explicit treatment of cooling and heating processes coupled with ray-tracing UV radiation transfer and resolved supernova feedback. The TIGRESS-NCR suite presented in this paper covers metallicity variation $Z'\equiv Z/Z_\odot\sim 0.1-3$, gas surface density $\Sigma_{\rm gas}\sim5-150{\,M_{\odot}{\rm pc^{-2}}}$, and stellar surface density $\Sigma_{\rm star}\sim1-50{M_{\odot}{\rm pc^{-2}}}$, leading to emergent SFR surface density $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}\sim 10^{-4}-0.5{M_{\odot}{\rm kpc^{-2}yr^{-1}}}$ and ISM total midplane pressure $P_{\rm tot}/k_B=10^3-10^6 {\rm cm^{-3}K}$, with $P_{\rm tot}$ equal to the ISM weight $W$. In our simulation suite, $\Sigma_{\rm SFR} \propto {Z'}^{0.3}$, which can be understood based on feedback physics. We present a new calibration for the components of feedback yield $\Upsilon$, defined as ratios between pressure (thermal, turbulent, and magnetic) and $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$. We find that the thermal feedback yield varies sensitively as $\Upsilon_{\rm th}\propto W^{-0.46}Z'^{-0.53}$, while the combined turbulent and magnetic feedback yield shows weaker dependence $\Upsilon_{\rm turb+mag}\propto W^{-0.22}Z'^{-0.18}$. The reduced $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ at low metallicity is due mainly to enhanced thermal feedback yield resulting from reduced attenuation of UV radiation. Combining vertical dynamical equilibrium, feedback yield, and effective equation of state, we provide a new metallicity-dependent subgrid star formation prescription that can be used in cosmological simulations where the ISM is unresolved.
