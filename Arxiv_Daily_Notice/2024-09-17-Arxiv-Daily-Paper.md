 - **Abstract**
 While neutrinos are often treated as a background for many dark matter experiments, these particles offer a new avenue for physics: the detection of core-collapse supernovae. Supernovae are extremely energetic, violent and complex events that mark the death of massive stars. During their collapse stars emit a large number of neutrinos in a short burst. These neutrinos carry 99\% of the emitted energy which makes their detection fundamental in understanding supernovae. This paper illustrates how COSINUS (Cryogenic Observatory for SIgnatures seen in Next-generation Underground Searches), a sodium iodide (NaI) based dark matter search, will be sensitive to the next galactic core-collapse supernova. The experiment is composed of two separate detectors which will be sensitive to far and nearby supernovae. The inner core of the experiment will consist of NaI crystals operating as scintillating calorimeters, mainly sensitive to the Coherent Elastic Scattering of Neutrinos (CE$\nu$NS) against the Na and I nuclei. The low mass of the cryogenic detectors gives the experiment a sensitivity to close supernovae below 1kpc without pileup. They will see up to hundreds of CE$\nu$NS events from a supernova happening at 200pc. The crystals reside at the center of a cylindrical 230T water tank, instrumented with 30 photomultipliers. This tank acts as a passive and active shield able to detect the Cherenkov radiation induced by impinging charged particles from ambient and cosmogenic radioactivity. A supernova near the Milky Way Center (10kpc) will be easily detected inducing $\sim$60 measurable events, and the water tank will have a 3$\sigma$ sensitivity to supernovae up to 22kpc, seeing $\sim$10 events. This paper shows how, even without dedicated optimization, modern dark matter experiments will also play their part in the multi-messenger effort to detect the next galactic core-collapse supernova.

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar initial-mass function (IMF) represents a fundamental quantity in astrophysics and cosmology, describing the mass distribution of stars from low to very-high masses. It is intimately linked to a wide variety of topics, including stellar and binary evolution, galaxy evolution, chemical enrichment, and cosmological reionization. Nonetheless, the IMF still remains highly uncertain. In this work, we aim at determining the IMF with a novel approach based on the observed rates of transients of stellar origin. We parametrize the IMF with a simple, but flexible, Larson shape, and insert it into a parametric model for the cosmic UV luminosity density, local stellar mass density, type Ia supernova (SN Ia), core-collapse supernova (CCSN), and long gamma-ray burst (LGRB) rates as function of redshift. We constrain our free parameters by matching the model predictions to a set of empirical determinations for the corresponding quantities, via a Bayesian Markov-Chain Monte Carlo method. Remarkably, we are able to provide an independent IMF determination, with characteristic mass $m_c=0.10^{+0.24}_{-0.08}\:M_{\odot}$, and high-mass slope $\xi=-2.53^{+0.24}_{-0.27}$, that is in accordance with the widely-used IMF parameterizations (e.g. Salpeter, Kroupa, Chabrier). Moreover, the adoption of an up-to-date recipe for the cosmic metallicity evolution, allows us to constrain the maximum metallicity of LGRB progenitors to $Z_{max}=0.12^{+0.29}_{-0.05}\:Z_{\odot}$. We also find what progenitor fraction actually leads to SN Ia or LGRB emission, put constraints on the CCSN and LGRB progenitor mass ranges, and test the IMF universality. These results show the potential of this kind of approach for studying the IMF, its putative evolution with galactic environment and cosmic history, and the properties of SN Ia, CCSN and LGRB progenitors, especially considering the wealth of data incoming in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 A statistically significant detection of the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) is around the corner. To this purpose, we assess the contribution to the DSNB of magnetorotational collapses of massive stars, relying on a suite of state-of-the-art three-dimensional neutrino-magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We find that neutrinos from magnetorotational core collapses boost the high-energy tail of the DSNB spectrum, similar to what is expected from neutrino-driven black hole-forming collapses. The latest data from the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration can already exclude that more than $13\%$ of all collapsing massive stars undergo magnetorotational collapses under optimistic assumptions. A DSNB detection at $3 \sigma$ could take place up to $4$ yr earlier at Super-Kamiokande-Gadolinium or JUNO if the fraction of magnetorotational collapses should be larger than $10\%$. Fascinatingly, if the fraction of magnetorotational stellar collapses should be larger than $7\%$, Hyper-Kamiokande could measure such a fraction at $3\sigma$ after $20$ yr of DSNB data taking. The combination of DSNB and electromagnetic data has the potential to resolve the degenerate contributions from magnetorotational and neutrino-driven black hole-forming collapses, providing crucial insight on the properties of the population of collapsing massive stars.
#### Knobs and dials of retrieving JWST transmission spectra. I. The importance of p-T profile complexity

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of using multipoint p-T profiles of varying complexity on the retrieval of synthetically generated hot Jupiter transmission spectra modelled after state-of-the-art observations of the hot Jupiter WASP-39~b with JWST. We perform homogenised atmospheric retrievals with the TauREx retrieval framework on a sample of synthetically generated transmission spectra, accounting for varying cases of underlying p-T profiles, cloud-top pressures, and expected noise levels. These retrievals are performed using a fixed-pressure multipoint p-T prescription with increasing complexity, ranging from isothermal to an eleven-point profile. We evaluate the performance of the retrievals based on the Bayesian model evidence, and the accuracy of the retrievals compared to the known input parameters. We find that performing atmospheric retrievals using an isothermal prescription for the pressure-temperature profile consistently results in wrongly retrieved atmospheric parameters when compared to the known input parameters. For an underlying p-T profile with a fully positive lapse rate, we find that a two-point profile is sufficient to retrieve the known atmospheric parameters, while under the presence of an atmospheric temperature inversion, we find that a more complex profile is necessary. Our investigation shows that, for a data quality scenario mirroring state-of-the-art observations of a hot Jupiter with JWST, an isothermal p-T prescription is insufficient to correctly retrieve the known atmospheric parameters. We find a model complexity preference dependent on the underlying pressure-temperature structure, but argue that a p-T prescription on the complexity level of a four-point profile should be preferred. This represents the overlap between the lowest number of free parameters and highest model preference in the cases investigated in this work.

 - **Abstract**
 The new in situ measurements of the Solar Orbiter mission contribute to the knowledge of the suprathermal populations in the solar wind, especially of ions and protons whose characterization, although still in the early phase, seems to suggest a major involvement in the interaction with plasma wave fluctuations. Recent studies point to the stimulating effect of suprathermal populations on temperature anisotropy instabilities in the case of electrons already being demonstrated in theory and numerical simulations. Here, we investigate anisotropic protons, addressing the electromagnetic ion-cyclotron (EMIC) and the proton firehose (PFH) instabilities. Suprathermal populations enhance the high-energy tails of the Kappa velocity (or energy) distributions measured in situ, enabling characterization by contrasting to the quasi-thermal population in the low-energy (bi-)Maxwellian core. We use hybrid simulations to investigate the two instabilities (with ions or protons as particles and electrons as fluid) for various configurations relevant to the solar wind and terrestrial magnetosphere. The new simulation results confirm the linear theory and its predictions. In the presence of suprathermal protons, the wave fluctuations reach increased energy density levels for both instabilities and cause faster and/or deeper relaxation of temperature anisotropy. The magnitude of suprathermal effects also depends on each instability's specific (initial) parametric regimes. These results further strengthen the belief that wave-particle interactions govern space plasmas. These provide valuable clues for understanding their dynamics, particularly the involvement of suprathermal particles behind the quasi-stationary non-equilibrium states reported by in situ observations.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we analysed young stellar clusters with spatial and kinematic coherence in the Orion star-forming complex. For this study, we selected a sample of pre-main sequence candidates using parallaxes, proper motions and positions on the colour-magnitude diagram. After applying a hierarchical clustering algorithm in the 5D parameter space provided by Gaia DR3, we divided the recovered clusters into two regimes: Big Structures and Small Structures, defined by the number of detected stars per cluster. In the first regime, we found 13 stellar groups distributed along the declination axis in the regions where there is a high density of stars. In the second regime, we recovered 34 clusters classified into two types: 14 as small groups completely independent from the larger structures, including four candidates of new clusters, and 12 classified as sub-structures embedded within five larger clusters. Additionally, radial velocity data from APOGEE-2 and GALAH DR3 was included to study the phase space in some regions of the Orion complex. From the Big Structure regime, we found evidence of a general expansion in the Orion OB1 association over a common centre, giving a clue about the dynamical effects the region is undergoing. Likewise, in the Small Structure regime, the projected kinematics shows the ballistic expansion in the $\lambda$ Orionis association and the detection of likely events of clusters' close encounters in the OB1 association.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the periodic flares observed in the 6.7 GHz methanol transition in G22.356+0.066, utilizing the Maxwell-Bloch equations (MBEs) as a framework to model these phenomena. By solving the one-dimensional MBEs, we describe the behavior of both the quasi-steady-state maser and transient superradiance regimes. Our findings indicate that the observed periodic flares, with varying timescales across different velocities, are consistent with the characteristics of Dicke's superradiance, triggered by a common radiative pump in regions of varying inverted column densities. This work provides new insights into the physical processes governing variability in maser-hosting regions and underscores the significance of superradiance as a powerful radiation mechanism in astrophysical environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of O- and B-type stars with extremely low-mass companions is very important for understanding the formation and evolution of binary stars. However, their finding remains a challenge because the low-mass components in such systems contribute such small flux to the total. During the searching for pulsations among O- and B-type stars by using the TESS data, we found two short-period and B-type (B9) eclipsing binaries with orbital periods of 1.61613 and 2.37857 days. Photometric solutions of the two close binaries were derived by analyzing the TESS light curves with the W-D method. It is discovered that both of them are detached binaries with extremely low mass ratios of 0.067(2) for TIC 260342097 and 0.140(3) for TIC 209148631, respectively. The determined mass ratio indicates that TIC 260342097 is one of the lowest mass ratios among known B-type binary systems. We showed that the two systems have total eclipses with a broad and flat secondary minimum, suggesting that the photometric parameters could be derived reliably. The absolute parameters of the two binaries are estimated and it is found that the secondary components in the two systems are over-luminous and over-size when compared with the normal low-mass and cool main-sequence (MS) stars. These findings may imply that the two systems are composed of a B-type MS primary and a cool pre-MS secondary with orbital periods shorter than 2.5 days. They are valuable targets to test theories of binary star formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent numerical works, including ours, lend credence to the thesis that ambient environment, i.e., external pressure, affects star-forming ability of clouds & filaments. In continuation with our series of papers on the subject we explore this thesis further by developing hydrodynamic simulations of accreting filaments confined by external pressures in the range $10^{4 -7}$ $K\ cm^{-3}$. Our findings are-\textbf{(i)} irrespective of linemass, filaments fragment to yield spheroidal cores. Initially sub-critical filaments in low to intermediate external pressure environments form broad cores which suggests, weakly self-gravitating filaments must fragment via \emph{collect-and-collapse} mode to form broad cores. Transcritical filaments, by contrast, become susceptible to Jeans-type instability and form pinched cores; \textbf{(ii)} ambient environment bears upon physical properties of filaments including their {\small FWHM$_{fil}$}. Only those initially suffused with subsonic turbulence in Solar Neighbourhood-like environs, however, have {\small FWHM$_{fil}$}$\sim$ 0.1 $pc$. In high pressure environs they not only have smaller widths, but become severely eviscerated. On the contrary, filaments suffused with initially supersonic turbulence are typically broader; \textbf{(iii)} quasi-oscillatory nature of velocity gradients is ubiquitous along filament lengths and its magnitude generally increases with increasing pressure. The periodicity of the velocity gradients approximately matches the fragmentation lengthscale of filaments; \textbf{(iv)} oscillatory features of the radial component of the velocity gradient are a unreliable proxy for detecting signatures of accretion onto filaments; \textbf{(v)} filaments at either extreme of external pressure are inefficient at cycling gas into the dense phase which could reconcile the corresponding inefficiency of star-formation in such environments.

 - **Abstract**
 With nearly two billion stars observed and their corresponding astrometric parameters evaluated in the recent Gaia mission, the number of astrometric binary candidates have risen significantly. Due to the surplus of astrometric data, the current computational methods employed to inspect these astrometric binary candidates are both computationally expensive and cannot be executed in a reasonable time frame. In light of this, a machine learning (ML) technique to automatically classify whether a set of stars belong to an astrometric binary pair via an artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed. Using data from Gaia DR3, the ANN was trained and tested on 1.5 million highly probable true and visual binaries, considering the proper motions, parallaxes, and angular and physical separations as features. The ANN achieves high classification scores, with an accuracy of 99.3%, a precision rate of 0.988, a recall rate of 0.991, and an AUC of 0.999, indicating that the utilized ML technique is a highly effective method for classifying astrometric binaries. Thus, the proposed ANN is a promising alternative to the existing methods for the classification of astrometric binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 Asymptotic giant branch stars (AGBs) and red supergiant stars (RSGs) exhibit significant mass loss phenomena and are considered important sources of interstellar dust. In this work, we employed an uniform method of spectral energy distribution fitting to analyze a large, and hence statistically significant, sample of approximately 40,000 RSGs and AGBs in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs), providing a new catalog of evolved stars that includes stellar parameters and dust properties. Our results reveal that the total dust-production rate (DPR) of the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately $9.69\times10^{-6}\,\rm{M_{\odot }\, yr^{-1}}$, while it is around $1.75\times10^{-6}\,\rm{M_{\odot }\,yr^{-1}}$ for the Small Magellanic Cloud, with a few stars significantly contributing to the total DPR. No significant differences were observed in the contributions to DPR from carbon-rich and oxygen-rich (O-rich) evolved stars in the MCs. We explored the relations between stellar parameters (luminosity, infrared color, period, amplitude) and mass-loss rate (MLR) for evolved stars. A prominent turning point at $\log{(L/L_{\odot})} \approx 4.4$ appears in the luminosity-MLR diagram of RSGs, potentially related to the mass-loss mechanism of RSGs. The luminosity-MLR relation of AGBs is highly scattered. The DPR of AGBs shows a clear change with pulsation period and amplitude, with DPR exhibiting a drastic increase at pulsation periods of approximately 300 days and I-band amplitudes greater than 0.5 mag. Metallicity has some impact on the DPR of O-rich stars, with lower metallicity seeming to result in lower mean DPR and a higher proportion of optically thin stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Theoretical descriptions of convective overshooting often rely on a one-dimensional parameterization of the flow called the filling factor for convection. Several definitions of the filling factor have been developed, based on: (1) the percentage of the volume, (2) the mass flux, and (3) the convective flux that moves through the boundary. We examine these definitions of the filling factor with the goal of establishing their ability to explain differences between 2D and 3D global simulations of stellar interiors that include fully compressible hydrodynamics and realistic microphysics for stars. We study pairs of identical two- and three-dimensional global simulations of stars produced with MUSIC, a fully compressible, time-implicit hydrodynamics code. We examine (1) a $3 M_\odot$ red giant star near the first dredge-up point, (2) a $1 M_\odot$ pre-main-sequence star with a large convection zone, (3) the current sun, and (4) a $20 M_\odot$ main-sequence star with a large convective core. Our calculations of the filling factor based on the volume percentage and the mass flux indicate asymmetrical convection near the surface for each star with an outer convection zone. However, near the convective boundary, convective flows achieve inward-outward symmetry; for 2D and 3D simulations, these filling factors are indistinguishable. A filling factor based on the convective flux is contaminated by boundary-layer-like flows, making theoretical interpretation difficult. We present two new alternatives to these standard definitions, which compare flows at two different radial points. The first is the penetration parameter of Anders et al. (2022). The second is a new statistic, the plume interaction parameter. We demonstrate that both of these parameters capture systematic differences between 2D and 3D simulations around the convective boundary.
#### Testing the asteroseismic estimates of stellar radii with surface brightness-colour relations and Gaia DR3 parallaxes. Red giants and red clump stars

 - **Abstract**
 We compared stellar radii derived from asteroseismic scaling relations with those estimated using two independent surface brightness-colour relations (SBCRs) and Gaia DR3 parallaxes. We cross-matched asteroseismic and astrometric data for over 6,400 RGB and RC stars from the APO-K2 catalogue with the TESS Input Catalogue v8.2 to obtain precise V band magnitudes and E(B-V) colour excesses. We then adopted two different SBCRs from the literature to derive stellar radius estimates, denoted as $R^a$ and $R^b$, respectively. We analysed the ratio of these SBCR-derived radii to the asteroseismic radius estimates, $R$, provided in the APO-K2 catalogue. Both SBCRs exhibited good agreement with asteroseismic radius estimates. On average, $R^a$ was overestimated by 1.2% with respect to $R$, while $R^b$ was underestimated by 2.5%. For stars larger than 20 $R_{\odot}$, SBCR radii are systematically lower than asteroseismic ones. The agreement with asteroseismic radii shows a strong dependence on the parallax. The dispersion is halved for stars with a parallax greater than 2.5 mas. In this subsample, $R^b$ showed perfect agreement with $R$, while $R^a$ remained slightly overestimated by 3%. A trend with [Fe/H] of 4% to 6% per dex was found. For stars less massive than about 0.95 $M_{\odot}$, SBCR radii were significantly higher than asteroseismic ones, by about 6%. This overestimation correlated with the presence of extended helium cores in these stars' structures relative to their envelopes. Furthermore, radius ratios showed a dichotomous behaviour at higher masses, mainly due to the presence of several RC stars with SBCR radii significantly lower with respect to asteroseismology. This behaviour originates from a different response of asteroseismic scaling relations and SBCR to [$\alpha$/Fe] abundance ratios for massive stars, both in RGB and RC phases, which is reported here for the first time.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. IRAS 16293E is a rare case of a prestellar core being subjected to the effects of at least one outflow.Aims. We want to disentangle the actual structure of the core from the outflow impact and evaluate the evolutionary stage of the core. Methods. Prestellar cores being cold and depleted, the best tracers of their central regions are the two isotopologues of trihydrogren cation which are observable from the ground, ortho-H$_2$D and para-D$_2$H . We used the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) telescope to map the para-D$_2$H$^+$ emission in IRAS 16293E and collected James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) archival data of ortho-H$_2$D$^+$ . We compare their emission to that of other tracers, including dust emission, and analyse their abundance with the help of a 1D radiative transfer tool. The ratio of the abundances of ortho-H$_2$D$^+$ and para-D$_2$H$^+$ can be used to estimate the stage of the chemical evolution of the core.Results. We have obtained the first complete map of para-D$_2$H$^+$ emission in a prestellar core. We compare it to a map of ortho-H$_2$D$^+$ and show their partial anti-correlation. This reveals a strongly evolved core with a para-D$_2$H$^+$/ortho-H$_2$D$^+$ abundance ratio towards the centre for which we obtain a conservative lower limit from 3.9 (at 12 K) up to 8.3 (at 8 K) while the high extinction of the core is indicative of a central temperature below 10 K. This ratio is higher than predicted by the known chemical models found in the literature. Para-D$_2$H$^+$ (and indirectly ortho-H$_2$D$^+$) is the only species that reveals the true centre of this core, while the emission of other molecular tracers and dust are biased by the temperature structure that results from the impact of the outflow.Conclusions. This study invites to reconsider the analysis of previous observations of this source and possibly questions the validity of the deuteration chemical models or of the reaction and inelastic collisional rate coefficients of the H$^{+3}$ isotopologue family. This could impact the deuteration clock predictions for all sources.

 - **Abstract**
 In the task of anomaly detection in modern time-domain photometric surveys, the primary goal is to identify astrophysically interesting, rare, and unusual objects among a large volume of data. Unfortunately, artifacts -- such as plane or satellite tracks, bad columns on CCDs, and ghosts -- often constitute significant contaminants in results from anomaly detection analysis. In such contexts, the Active Anomaly Discovery (AAD) algorithm allows tailoring the output of anomaly detection pipelines according to what the expert judges to be scientifically interesting. We demonstrate how the introduction real-bogus scores, obtained from a machine learning classifier, improves the results from AAD. Using labeled data from the SNAD ZTF knowledge database, we train four real-bogus classifiers: XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, and Extremely Randomized Trees. All the models perform real-bogus classification with similar effectiveness, achieving ROC-AUC scores ranging from 0.93 to 0.95. Consequently, we select the Random Forest model as the main model due to its simplicity and interpretability. The Random Forest classifier is applied to 67 million light curves from ZTF DR17. The output real-bogus score is used as an additional feature for two anomaly detection algorithms: static Isolation Forest and AAD. While results from Isolation Forest remained unchanged, the number of artifacts detected by the active approach decreases significantly with the inclusion of the real-bogus score, from 27 to 3 out of 100. We conclude that incorporating the real-bogus classifier result as an additional feature in the active anomaly detection pipeline significantly reduces the number of artifacts in the outputs, thereby increasing the incidence of astrophysically interesting objects presented to human experts.

Although empirical, its extensive use since its inception to describe polarization induced by interstellar dust has elevated the relation to the status of an indisputable "law", serving as the benchmark for validating interstellar dust grain models. We revisit the effects of the 3D structure of the interstellar medium (ISM) on the wavelength dependence of interstellar polarization. We use analytical models to show how the wavelength dependence of both the polarization fraction and direction is affected by the presence of multiple clouds along the line of sight (LOS), accounting for recent developments in dust distribution modelling and utilizing an expanded archive of stellar polarization measurements. We highlight concrete examples of stars whose polarization profiles are severely affected by LOS variations of the dust grain and magnetic field properties, and we provide a recipe to accurately fit multiple cloud Serkowski models to such cases. We present, for the first time, compelling observational evidence that the 3D structure of the magnetized ISM often results to the violation of the Serkowski relation. We show that 3D effects impact interstellar cloud parameters derived from Serkowski fits. In particular, the dust size distribution in single - cloud sightlines may differ from analyses that ignore 3D effects, with important implications for dust modelling in the Galaxy. Our results suggest that multiband stellar polarization measurements offer an independent probe of the LOS variations of the magnetic field, constituting a valuable new tool for the 3D cartography of the ISM. We caution that, unless 3D effects are explicitly accounted for, a poor fit to the Serkowski relation does not, by itself, constitute conclusive evidence that a star is intrinsically polarized.

 - **Abstract**
 The C IV doublet in the UV has long been associated with accretion in T Tauri stars. However, it is still unclear where and how the lines are formed. Here, we present a new C IV line model based on the currently available accretion shock and accretion flow models. We assume axisymmetric, dipolar accretion flows with different energy fluxes and calculate the properties of the accretion shock. We use Cloudy to obtain the carbon level populations and calculate the emerging line profiles assuming a plane-parallel geometry near the shock. Our model generally reproduces the intensities and shapes of the C IV emission lines observed from T Tauri stars. We find that the narrow component is optically thin and originates in the postshock, while the broad component is optically thick and emerges from the preshock. We apply our model to seven T Tauri stars from the Hubble Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards Director's Discretionary program (ULLYSES), for which consistently determined accretion shock properties are available. We can reproduce the observations of four stars, finding that the accretion flows are carbon-depleted. We also find that the chromospheric emission accounts for less than 10 percent of the observed C IV line flux in accreting T Tauri stars. This work paves the way toward a better understanding of hot line formation and provides a potential probe of abundances in the inner disk.
