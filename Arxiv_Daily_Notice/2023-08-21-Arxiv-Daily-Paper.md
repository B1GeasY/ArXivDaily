#### Star formation in the centre of NGC 1808 as observed by ALMA

 - **Abstract**
 We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of 85.69 and 99.02 GHz continuum emission and H42$\alpha$ and H40$\alpha$ lines emission from the central 1~kpc of NGC 1808. These forms of emission are tracers of photoionizing stars but unaffected by dust obscuration that we use to test the applicability of other commonly star formation metrics. An analysis of the spectral energy distributions shows that free-free emission contributes about 60 to 90 per cent of the continuum emission in the 85-100 GHz frequency range, dependent on the region. The star formation rate (SFR) derived from the ALMA free-free emission is $3.1\pm0.3$~M$_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$. This is comparable to the SFRs measured from the infrared emission, mainly because most of the bolometric energy from the heavily obscured region is emitted as infrared emission. The radio 1.5~GHz emission yields a SFR 25 per cent lower than the ALMA value, probably because of the diffusion of the electrons producing the synchrotron emission beyond the star-forming regions. The SFRs measured from the extinction-corrected H$\alpha$ line emission are about 40 to 65 per cent of the SFR derived from the ALMA data, likely because this metric was not calibrated for high extinction regions. Some SFRs based on extinction-corrected ultraviolet emission are similar to those from ALMA and infrared data, but given that the ultraviolet terms in the extinction correction equations are very small, these metrics seem inappropriate to apply to this dusty starburst.

 - **Abstract**
 Using a sample of $>200$ clusters, each with typically $100-200$ spectroscopically confirmed cluster members, we search for a signal of alignment between the Position Angle (PA) of the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) and the distribution of cluster members on the sky about the cluster centre out to projected distances of 3~R$_{200}$. The deep spectroscopy, combined with corrections for spectroscopic incompleteness, makes our sample ideal to determine alignment signal strengths. We also use an SDSS based skeleton of the filamentary Large Scale Structure (LSS), and measure BCG alignment with the location of the LSS skeleton segments on the sky out to projected distances of 10~R$_{200}$. The alignment signal is measured using three separate statistical measures; Rao's spacing test (U), Kuiper's V parameter (V), and the Binomial probability test (P). The significance of the BCG alignment signal with both cluster members and LSS segments is extremely high (1 in a million chance or less to be drawn randomly from a uniform distribution). We investigate a wide set of parameters that may influence the strength of the alignment signal. Clusters with more elliptical-shaped BCGs show stronger alignment with both their cluster members and LSS segments. Also, selecting clusters with closely connected filaments, or using a luminosity-weighted LSS skeleton, increases the alignment signal significantly. Alignment strength decreases with increasing projected distance. Combined, these results provide strong evidence for the growth of clusters and their BCGs by preferential feeding along the direction of the filaments in which they are embedded.
#### $G$ Objects and primordial black holes

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08623
 - **Abstract**
 We suggest that "$G$ objects" recently discovered in the Galactic Center may be clouds of gas bound by the gravitational field of stellar-mass black holes produced in the interactions of sublunar primordial black holes with neutron stars. If dark matter is composed of primordial black holes with masses $(10^{-16} - 10^{-10}) M_\odot$, these black holes can be captured by neutron stars in the Galactic Center, where the dark matter density is high. After the capture, the neutron star is consumed by the black hole, resulting in a population of $(1-2) M_\odot $ black holes. These stellar-mass black holes, accompanied by gaseous atmospheres, can account for the observed properties of the $G$ objects, including their resilience to tidal disruption by the supermassive black hole in the Galactic Center while also producing emission consistent with inferred luminosities.
#### The 107 GHz methanol transition is a dasar in G0.253+0.016

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of population anti-inversion in the $3_1 - 4_0\ A^+$ transition of CH$_3$OH (methanol) at 107.013831 GHz toward the Galactic Center cloud G0.253+0.016 ("The Brick"). Anti-inversion of molecular level populations can result in absorption lines against the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in a phenomenon known as a "dasar." We model the physical conditions under which the 107 GHz methanol transition dases and determine that dasing occurs at densities below $10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ and column densities between $10^{13}$ and $10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$. We also find that for this transition, dasing does not strongly depend on the gas kinetic temperature. We evaluate the potential of this tool for future deep galaxy surveys. We note that other works have already reported absorption in this transition (e.g., in NGC 253), but we provide the first definitive evidence that it is absorption against the CMB rather than against undetected continuum sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-short period planets (USPs) are a unique class of super-Earths with an orbital period of less than a day and hence subject to intense radiation from their host star. While most of them are consistent with bare rocks, some show evidence of a heavyweight envelope, which could be a water layer or a secondary metal-rich atmosphere sustained by an outgassing surface. Much remains to be learned about the nature of USPs. The prime goal of the present work is to study the bulk planetary properties and atmosphere of TOI-561b, through the study of its transits and occultations. We obtained ultra-precise transit photometry of TOI-561b with CHEOPS and performed a joint analysis of this data with four TESS sectors. Our analysis of TOI-561b transit photometry put strong constraints on its properties, especially on its radius, Rp=1.42 +/- 0.02 R_Earth (at ~2% error). The internal structure modelling of the planet shows that the observations are consistent with negligible H/He atmosphere, however requiring other lighter materials, in addition to pure iron core and silicate mantle to explain the observed density. We find that this can be explained by the inclusion of a water layer in our model. We searched for variability in the measured Rp/R* over time to trace changes in the structure of the planetary envelope but none found within the data precision. In addition to the transit event, we tentatively detect occultation signal in the TESS data with an eclipse depth of ~27 +/- 11 ppm. Using the models of outgassed atmospheres from the literature we find that the thermal emission from the planet can mostly explain the observation. Based on this, we predict that NIR/MIR observations with JWST should be able to detect silicate species in the atmosphere of the planet. This could also reveal important clues about the planetary interior and help disentangle planet formation and evolution models.
#### Analysis of the interstellar matter at the periphery of the supershell  surrounding the CYG OB1 association in 2.12 micron molecular hydrogen line

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of the vdB 130 cluster vicinity in a narrow-band filter centered at a $2.12\,\mu$m molecular hydrogen line performed at the Caucasus Mountain Observatory of the Lomonosov Moscow State University. The observations reveal an H$_2$ emission shell around vdB 130, coincident with a bright infrared shell, visible in all \textit{Spitzer} bands. Also, numerous H$_{2}$ emission features are detected around infrared Blobs E and W and in the vicinity of a protocluster located to the east of the shell, in a tail of a cometary molecular cloud. H$_2$ emission in the vicinity of the vdB~130 cluster is mostly generated in well-developed \HII\ regions and is of fluorescent nature. In the protocluster area, isolated spots are observed, where H$_2$ emission is collisionally excited and is probably related to shocks in protostellar outflows. Obtained results are discussed in the context of possible sequential star formation in the vicinity of the vdB 130 cluster, triggered by the interaction of the expanding supershell surrounding the Cyg OB1 association with the molecular cloud and an associated molecular filament.

 - **Abstract**
 We present \textit{JWST} images of the well-known planetary nebula NGC\,6720 (the Ring Nebula), covering wavelengths from 1.6$\mu$m to 25 $\mu$m. The bright shell is strongly fragmented with some 20\,000 dense globules, bright in H$_2$, with a characteristic diameter of 0.2~arcsec and density $n_{\rm H} \sim 10^5$--$10^6$\,cm$^{-3}$. The shell contains a thin ring of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission. H$_2$ is found throughout the shell and in the halo. H$_2$ in the halo may be located on the swept-up walls of a biconal polar flow. The central cavity is shown to be filled with high ionization gas and shows two linear structures. The central star is located 2~arcsec from the emission centroid of the cavity and shell. Linear features (`spikes') extend outward from the ring, pointing away from the central star. Hydrodynamical simulations are shown which reproduce the clumping and possibly the spikes. Around ten low-contrast, regularly spaced concentric arc-like features are present; they suggest orbital modulation by a low-mass companion with a period of about 280~yr A previously known much wider companion is located at a projected separation of about 15\,000~au; we show that it is an M2--M4 dwarf. The system is therefore a triple star. These features, including the multiplicity, are similar to those seen in the Southern Ring Nebula (NGC\,3132) and may be a common aspect of such nebulae.
#### Evidence for late-time dust formation in the ejecta of supernova  SN~1995N from emission-line asymmetries

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the dust associated with the core-collapse supernova SN~1995N. Infrared emission detected 14--15 years after the explosion was previously attributed to thermally echoing circumstellar material associated with the SN progenitor. We argue that this late-time emission is unlikely to be an echo, and is more plausibly explained by newly formed dust in the supernova ejecta, indirectly heated by the interaction between the ejecta and the CSM. Further evidence in support of this scenario comes from emission line profiles in spectra obtained 22 years after the explosion; these are asymmetric, showing greater attenuation on the red wing, consistent with absorption by dust within the expanding ejecta. The spectral energy distribution and emission line profiles at epochs later than $\sim$5000 days are both consistent with the presence of about 0.4~M$_\odot$ of amorphous carbon dust. The onset of dust formation is apparent in archival optical spectra, taken between 700 and 1700 days after the assumed explosion date. As this is considerably later than most other instances where the onset of dust formation has been detected, we argue that the explosion date must be later than previously assumed.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernovae are an important source of energy in the interstellar medium. Young remnants of supernovae have a peak emission in the X-ray region, making them interesting objects for X-ray observations. In particular, the supernova remnant SN1006 is of great interest due to its historical record, proximity and brightness. It has therefore been studied by several X-ray telescopes. Improving the X-ray imaging of this and other remnants is important but challenging as it requires to address a spatially varying instrument response in order to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we use Chandra observations to demonstrate the capabilities of Bayesian image reconstruction using information field theory. Our objective is to reconstruct denoised, deconvolved and spatio-spectral resolved images from X-ray observations and to decompose the emission into different morphologies, namely diffuse and point-like. Further, we aim to fuse data from different detectors and pointings into a mosaic and quantify the uncertainty of our result. Utilizing prior knowledge on the spatial and spectral correlation structure of the two components, diffuse emission and point sources, the presented method allows the effective decomposition of the signal into these. In order to accelerate the imaging process, we introduce a multi-step approach, in which the spatial reconstruction obtained for a single energy range is used to derive an informed starting point for the full spatio-spectral reconstruction. The method is applied to 11 Chandra observations of SN1006 from 2008 and 2012, providing a detailed, denoised and decomposed view of the remnant. In particular, the separated view of the diffuse emission should provide new insights into its complex small-scale structures in the center of the remnant and at the shock front profiles.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detection of SiC$_2$ in the interstellar medium. The molecule was identified through six rotational transitions toward G\,+0.693$-$0.027, a molecular cloud located in the Galactic center. The detection is based on a line survey carried out with the GBT, the Yebes 40m, and the IRAM 30m telescopes covering a range of frequencies from 12 to 276 GHz. We fit the observed spectra assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium and derive a column density of ($1.02\pm0.04)\times10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, which gives a fractional abundance of $7.5\times10^{-11}$ with respect to H$_2$, and an excitation temperature of $5.9\pm0.2$ K. We conclude that SiC$_2$ can be formed in the shocked gas by a reaction between the sputtered atomic silicon and C$_2$H$_2$, or it can be released directly from the dust grains due to disruption. We also search for other Si-bearing molecules and detect eight rotational transitions of SiS and four transitions of Si$^{18}$O. The derived fractional abundances are $3.9\times10^{-10}$ and $2.1\times10^{-11}$, respectively. All Si-bearing species toward G\,+0.693$-$0.027 show fractional abundances well below what is typically found in late-type evolved stars.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) There is a diverse chemical inventory in protostellar regions leading to the classification of extreme types of systems. Warm carbon chain chemistry sources, for one, are the warm and dense regions near a protostar containing unsaturated carbon chain molecules. Since the presentation of this definition in 2008, there is a growing field to detect and characterise these sources. The details are lesser known in relation to hot cores and in high-mass star-forming regions -- regions of great importance in galactic evolution. To investigate the prevalence of carbon chain species and their environment in high-mass star-forming regions, we have conducted targeted spectral surveys of two sources in the direction of Cygnus X -- AFGL 2591 and IRAS 20126+4104 -- with the Green Bank Telescope and the IRAM 30m Telescope. We have constructed a Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) model using the observed molecular spectra to determine the physical environment in which these molecules originate. We map both the observed spatial distribution and the physical parameters found from the LTE model. We also determine the formation routes of these molecules in each source using the three-phase NAUTILUS chemical evolution code. We detect several lines of propyne, CH$_3$CCH, and cyclopropenylidene, $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ as tracers of carbon chain chemistry, as well as several lines of formaldehyde, H$_2$CO, and methanol, CH$_3$OH, as a precursor and a tracer of complex organic molecule chemistry, respectively. We find excitation temperatures of 20-30 K for the carbon chains and 8-85 K for the complex organics. The CH$_3$CCH abundances are reproduced by a warm-up model, consistent with warm carbon chain chemistry, while the observed CH$_3$OH abundances require a shock mechanism sputtering the molecules into the gas phase.
#### Milliarcsecond Core Size Dependence of the Radio Variability of Blazars

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the long-term radio variability (timescales of months to years) of blazars enables us to gain a better understanding of the physical structure of these objects on sub-parsec scales, and the physics of super massive black holes. In this study, we focus on the radio variability of 1157 blazars observed at 15~GHz through the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) Blazar Monitoring Program. We investigate the dependence of the variability amplitudes and timescales, characterized based on model fitting to the structure functions, on the milliarcsecond core sizes measured by Very Long Baseline Interferometry. We find that the most compact sources at milliarcsecond scales exhibit larger variability amplitudes and shorter variability timescales than more extended sources. Additionally, for sources with measured redshifts and Doppler boosting factors, the correlation between linear core sizes against variability amplitudes and intrinsic timescales are also significant. The observed relationship between variability timescales and core sizes is expected, based on light travel-time arguments. This variability vs core size relation extends beyond the core sizes measured at 15\,GHz; we see significant correlation between the 15\,GHz variability amplitudes (as well as timescales) and core sizes measured at other frequencies, which can be attributed to a frequency-source size relationship arising from the intrinsic jet structure. At low frequencies of 1\,GHz where the core sizes are dominated by interstellar scattering, we find that the variability amplitudes have significant correlation with the 1~GHz intrinsic core angular sizes, once the scatter broadening effects are deconvoluted from the intrinsic core sizes.
#### A deep learning approach for the 3D reconstruction of dust density and  temperature in star-forming regions

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: We introduce a new deep learning approach for the reconstruction of 3D dust density and temperature distributions from multi-wavelength dust emission observations on the scale of individual star-forming cloud cores (<0.2 pc). Methods: We construct a training data set by processing cloud cores from the Cloud Factory simulations with the POLARIS radiative transfer code to produce synthetic dust emission observations at 23 wavelengths between 12 and 1300 $\mu$m. We simplify the task by reconstructing the cloud structure along individual lines of sight and train a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) for this purpose. The cINN belongs to the group of normalising flow methods and is able to predict full posterior distributions for the target dust properties. We test different cINN setups, ranging from a scenario that includes all 23 wavelengths down to a more realistically limited case with observations at only seven wavelengths. We evaluate the predictive performance of these models on synthetic test data. Results: We report an excellent reconstruction performance for the 23-wavelengths cINN model, achieving median absolute relative errors of about 1.8% in $\log(n_{dust}/m^{-3})$ and 1% in $\log(T_{dust}/K)$, respectively. We identify trends towards overestimation at the low end of the density range and towards underestimation at the high end of both density and temperature, which may be related to a bias in the training data. Limiting coverage to a combination of only seven wavelengths, we still find a satisfactory performance with average absolute relative errors of about 3.3% and 2.5% in $\log(n_{dust}/m^{-3})$ and $\log(T_{dust}/K)$. Conclusions: This proof of concept study shows that the cINN-based approach for 3D reconstruction of dust density and temperature is very promising and even feasible under realistic observational constraints.
