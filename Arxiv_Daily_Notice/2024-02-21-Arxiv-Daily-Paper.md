 - **Abstract**
 We carry out an in-depth analysis of the prompt-collapse behaviour of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. To this end, we perform more than $80$ general relativistic BNS merger simulations using a family of realistic Equations of State (EOS) with different stiffness, which feature a first order deconfinement phase transition between hadronic and quark matter. From these simulations we infer the critical binary mass $M_{\rm crit}$ that separates the prompt from the non-prompt collapse regime. We show that the critical mass increases with the stiffness of the EOS and obeys a tight quasi-universal relation, $M_{\rm crit}/M_{\rm TOV}\approx 1.41\pm 0.06$, which links it to the maximum mass $M_{\rm TOV}$ of static neutron stars, and therefore provides a straightforward estimate for the total binary mass beyond which prompt collapse becomes inevitable. In addition, we introduce a novel gauge independent definition for a one-parameter family of threshold masses in terms of curvature invariants of the Riemann tensor which characterizes the development toward a more rapid collapse with increasing binary mass. Using these diagnostics, we find that the amount of matter remaining outside the black hole sharply drops in supercritical mass mergers compared to subcritical ones and is further reduced in mergers where the black hole collapse is induced by the formation of a quark matter core. This implies that $M_{\rm crit}$, particularly for merger remnants featuring quark matter cores, imposes a strict upper limit on the emission of any detectable electromagnetic counterpart in BNS mergers.
#### HYACINTH: HYdrogen And Carbon chemistry in theINTerstellar medium in  Hydro simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We present a new sub-grid model, HYACINTH -- HYdrogen And Carbon chemistry in the INTerstellar medium in Hydro simulations, for computing the non-equilibrium abundances of ${\rm H_2}$ and its carbon-based tracers, namely ${\rm CO}$, ${\rm C}$, and ${\rm C^+}$, in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. Methods. The model accounts for the unresolved density structure in simulations using a variable probability distribution function of sub-grid densities and a temperature-density relation. Included is a simplified chemical network tailored for hydrogen and carbon chemistry within molecular clouds and easily integrated into large-scale simulations with minimal computational overhead. As an example, we apply HYACINTH to a simulated galaxy at redshift $z\sim2.5$ in post-processing and compare the resulting abundances with observations. Results. The chemical predictions from HYACINTH show a good agreement with high-resolution molecular-cloud simulations. We reproduce the $\rm H\,I - {\rm H_2}$ transition in the $f_{\rm H_2} - N_{\rm H}$ plane for both Milky-Way and LMC-like conditions. We also match the $N_{\rm CO} - N_{\rm H_2}$ values inferred from absorption measurements towards Milky-Way molecular clouds. Column density maps reveal that ${\rm CO}$ is concentrated in the peaks of the $\rm H_2$ distribution, while atomic carbon more broadly traces the bulk of ${\rm H_2}$ in our post-processed galaxy. Based on surface density profiles of stars and different gas species in the post-processed galaxy, we find that ${\rm C^+}$ extends farther than all other components and maintains a substantially high surface density out to $\sim 10 \, \rm kpc$. This is similar to the $[\rm C\,II]$ halos found in some recent observations at high redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the upGREAT instrument on SOFIA, we have imaged [C II] 157.74 and [O I] 63.18 micron line emission from a bright photodissociation region (PDR) associated with an ionized ``bubble'' located in the Nessie Nebula, a filamentary infrared dark cloud. A comparison with ATCA data reveals a classic PDR structure, with a uniform progression from ionized gas, to photodissociated gas, and on to molecular gas from the bubble's interior to its exterior. [O I] line emission from the bubble's PDR reveals self-absorption features. Toward a FIR-bright protostar, both [O I] and [C II] show an absorption feature at a velocity of $-18$ km/s, the same velocity as an unrelated foreground molecular cloud. Since the gas density in typical molecular clouds is well below the [O I] and [C II] critical densities, the excitation temperatures for both lines are low (~20 K). The Meudon models demonstrate that the surface of a molecular cloud, externally illuminated by a standard G_0 = 1 interstellar radiation field, can produce absorption features in both transitions. Thus, the commonly observed [O I] and [C II] self-absorption and absorption features plausibly arise from the subthermally excited, externally illuminated, photodissociated envelopes of molecular clouds. The luminous young stellar object AGAL337.916-00.477, located precisely where the expanding bubble strikes the Nessie filament, is associated with two shock tracers: NH3 (3,3) maser emission and SiO 2-1 emission, indicating interaction between the bubble and the filament. The interaction of the expanding bubble with its parental dense filament has triggered star formation.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11113
 - **Abstract**
 Context. Small bodies change their brightness due to different motives: Rotation along their axis or axes, combined with irregular shapes and/or changing surface properties, or changes in the geometry of observations. In this work, we tackle the problem of Phase curves, which show the change in brightness due to changes in the fraction of illuminated surface as seen by the observer. Aims. We aim to study the effect of the phase curves in the five wavelengths of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in scores of objects (several tens of thousands), focusing particularly on the spectral slopes and the colors and their changes with phase angle. Methods. We used a Bayesian inference method and Monte Carlo techniques to retrieve the absolute magnitudes in five wavelengths, using the results to study the phase coloring effect in different bins of the semi-major axis. Results. We obtained absolute magnitudes in the five filters for over 40 000 objects. Although some outliers are identified, most of the usual color-color space is recovered by the data presented. We also detect a dual behavior in the spectral slopes, with a change at ${\alpha\approx}$ 5 deg.

 - **Abstract**
 Dense core collisions, previously regarded as minor in star formation, are proposed to play a significant role in structure formation around protostellar envelopes and binary formation. Using archival data of nearby star-forming regions, we determine the frequencies of core collisions. Our calculations reveal that a typical core is likely to undergo multiple interactions with other cores throughout its lifetime. To further investigate the core collision process, we employ adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamic simulations with sink particles. Our simulations demonstrate that following the formation of a protostar within a gravitationally-unstable core, the merging core's accreting gas gives rise to a rotationally-supported circumstellar disk. Meanwhile, the region compressed by the shock between the cores develops into asymmetric arms that connect with the disk. Gas along these arms tends to migrate inward, ultimately falling toward the protostar. One of the arms, a remnant of the shock-compressed region, dominates over the second core gas, potentially exhibiting a distinct chemical composition. This is consistent with recent findings of large-scale streamers around protostars. Additionally, we found that collisions with velocities of $\sim$ 1.5 km s$^{-1}$ result in the formation of a binary system, as evidenced by the emergence of a sink particle within the dense section of the shocked layer. Overall, dense core collisions are highlighted as a critical process in creating $10^3$ au-scale streamers around protostellar systems and binary stars.
#### Planetesimal and planet formation in transient dust traps

 - **Abstract**
 The ring-like structures in protoplanetary discs that are observed in the cold dust emission by ALMA, might be explained by dust aggregates trapped aerodynamically in pressure maxima. The effect of a transient pressure maximum is investigated that develops between two regimes with different turbulent levels. We study how such a pressure maximum collects dust aggregates and transforms them into large planetesimals and Moon-mass cores that can further grow to a few Earth-mass planets by pebble accretion, and eventually to giant planets, by considering the accretion of a gaseous envelope. A numerical model is developed, incorporating the evolution of gaseous disc, growth and transport of pebbles, N-body interactions of growing planetary cores and their backreaction to gas disc by opening a partial gap. Planetesimal formation by streaming instability is parametrized in our model. A transient pressure maximum efficiently accumulates dust particles that can grow larger than mm-size. If this happens, dust aggregates can be transformed by the streaming instability process into such large planetesimals, which can grow further by pebble accretion, according to our assumptions. As the gas evolves to its steady state, the pressure maximum vanishes, and the concentrated pebbles that are not transformed to planetesimals and accreted by the growing planet, drift inward. During this inward drift, if the conditions of the streaming instability are met, planetesimals are formed in a wide radial range of the disc. Conclusions. A transient pressure maximum is a favourable place for planetesimal and planet formation during its lifetime and the concentration of pebbles induces continuous formation of planetesimals even after its disappearance. Besides, the formation of a planet can trigger the formation of planetesimals over a wide area of the protoplanetary disc.
#### The boundary of cosmic filaments

 - **Abstract**
 For decades, the boundary of cosmic filaments have been a subject of debate. In this work, we determine the physically-motivated radii of filaments by constructing stacked galaxy number density profiles around the filament spines. We find that the slope of the profile changes with distance to the filament spine, reaching its minimum at approximately 1 Mpc at z = 0 in both state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations and observational data. This can be taken as the average value of the filament radius. Furthermore, we note that the average filament radius rapidly decreases from z = 4 to z = 1, and then slightly increases. Moreover, we find that the filament radius depends on the filament length, the distance from connected clusters, and the masses of the clusters. These results suggest a two-phase formation scenario of cosmic filaments. The filaments experience rapid contraction before z = 1, but their density distribution has remained roughly stable since then. The subsequent mass transport along the filaments to the connected clusters is likely to have contributed to the formation of the clusters themselves.
#### Revision of the GeV $γ$-ray Emission in the Region of HESS  J1813-178 with Fermi-LAT

 - **Abstract**
 HESS J1813-178 is one of the brightest and most compact TeV $\gamma$-ray sources, and whether its $\gamma$-ray emission is associated with supernova remnant (SNR), pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or young stellar cluster (YSC) is still under debate. By analysing the GeV $\gamma$-ray data in the field of HESS J1813-178 using 14 years of PASS 8 data recorded by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT), we report the discovery of three different sources with different spectra in this region. The hard source with a power law spectral index of 2.11 $\pm$ 0.08 has a small size extension, which is spatially and spectrally coincident with the TeV $\gamma$-ray emission from HESS J1813-178. CO observations display the dense molecular clouds surrounding HESS J1813-178 in the velocity range of 45-60 km s$^{\rm -1}$. The possible origins of the $\gamma$-ray emission from HESS J1813-178 are discussed, including SNR G12.82-0.02, the PWN driven by the energetic X-ray pulsar PSR J1813-1749, and YSC Cl 1813-178. However, none of them can be ruled out clearly. Note that the maximum energy of protons in the hadronic model should exceed a few hundred TeV, which makes HESS J1813-178 to be a promising PeVatron. The detailed LHAASO data analysis about the morphology and spectrum would be helpful to investigate the origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission in this region and test its PeVatron nature.
#### Measuring the magnetic dipole moment and magnetospheric fluctuations of  SXP 18.3 with a Kalman filter

 - **Abstract**
 The magnetic dipole moment $\mu$ of an accretion-powered pulsar in magnetocentrifugal equilibrium cannot be inferred uniquely from time-averaged pulse period and aperiodic X-ray flux data, because the radiative efficiency $\eta_0$ of the accretion is unknown, as are the mass, radius, and distance of the star. The degeneracy associated with the radiative efficiency is circumvented, if fluctuations of the pulse period and aperiodic X-ray flux are tracked with a Kalman filter, whereupon $\mu$ can be measured uniquely up to the uncertainties in the mass, radius, and distance. Here the Kalman filter analysis is demonstrated successfully in practice for the first time on Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations of the X-ray transient SXP 18.3 in the Small Magellanic Cloud, which is monitored regularly. The analysis yields $\mu = 8.0^{+1.3}_{-1.2} \, \times \, 10^{30} \, {\rm G \, cm^3}$ and $\eta_0 = 0.04^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$, compared to $\mu = 5.0^{+1.0}_{-1.0} \times 10^{30} \, {\rm G \, cm^3}$ as inferred traditionally from time-averaged data assuming $\eta_0=1$. The analysis also yields time-resolved estimates of two hidden state variables, the mass accretion rate and the Maxwell stress at the disk-magnetosphere boundary. The success of the demonstration confirms that the Kalman filter analysis can be applied in the future to study the magnetic moments and disk-magnetosphere physics of accretion-powered pulsar populations in the Small Magellanic Cloud and elsewhere.
#### TASTE V. A new ground-based investigation of orbital decay in the  ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-12b

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of the first transiting hot Jupiters (HJs; giant planets on orbital periods shorter than $P\sim10$ days) was announced more than twenty years ago. As both ground- and space-based follow-up observations are piling up, we are approaching the temporal baseline required to detect secular variations in their orbital parameters. In particular, several recent studies focused on constraining the efficiency of the tidal decay mechanism to better understand the evolutionary time scales of HJ migration and engulfment. This can be achieved by measuring a monotonic decrease of orbital period $\mathrm{d}P/\mathrm{d}t<0$ due to mechanical energy being dissipated by tidal friction. WASP-12b was the first HJ for which a tidal decay scenario appeared convincing, even though alternative explanations have been hypothesized. Here we present a new analysis based on 28 unpublished high-precision transit light curves gathered over a twelve-year baseline and combined with all the available archival data, and an updated set of stellar parameters from HARPS-N high-resolution spectra, which are consistent with a main sequence scenario, close to the hydrogen exhaustion in the core. Our values of $\mathrm{d}P/\mathrm{d}t$ = $-30.72 \pm 2.67$ and $Q_{\ast}^{'}$ = $(2.13 \pm 0.18) \times 10^{5}$ are statistically consistent with previous studies, and indicate that WASP-12 is undergoing fast tidal dissipation. We additionally report the presence of an excess scatter in the timing data and discuss its possible origin.
#### Water Vapour Transit Ambiguities for Habitable M-Earths

 - **Abstract**
 We have shown in a recent study, using 3D climate simulations, that dayside land cover has a substantial impact on the climate of a synchronously rotating temperate rocky planet such as Proxima Centauri b. Building on that result, we generate synthetic transit spectra from our simulations to assess the impact of these land-induced climate uncertainties on water vapour transit signals. We find that distinct climate regimes will likely be very difficult to differentiate in transit spectra, even under the more favourable conditions of smaller planets orbiting ultracool dwarfs. Further, we show that additional climate ambiguities arise when both land cover and atmosphere mass are unknown, as is likely to be the case for transiting planets. While water vapour may be detectable under favourable conditions, it may be nearly impossible to infer a rocky planet's surface conditions or climate state from its transit spectrum due to the interdependent effects of land cover and atmosphere mass on surface temperature, humidity, and terminator cloud cover.
#### Low-mass Runaways from the Orion Nebula Cluster -- Kinematic Age  Constraints on Star Cluster Formation

 - **Abstract**
 In their early, formative stages star clusters can undergo rapid dynamical evolution leading to strong gravitational interactions and ejection of ``runaway'' stars at high velocities. While O/B runaway stars have been well studied, lower-mass runaways are so far very poorly characterised, even though they are expected to be much more common. We carried out spectroscopic observations with MAG2-MIKE to follow-up 27 high priority candidate runaways consistent with having been ejected from the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) $>2.5$ Myr ago, based on Gaia astrometry. We derive spectroscopic youth indicators (Li \& H$\alpha$) and radial velocities, enabling detection of bona fide runaway stars via signatures of youth and 3D traceback. We successfully confirmed 10 of the candidates as low-mass Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) on the basis of our spectroscopic criteria and derived radial velocities (RVs) with which we performed 3D traceback analysis. Three of these confirmed YSOs have kinematic ejection ages $>4\:$Myr, with the oldest being 4.7~Myr. This yields an estimate for the overall formation time of the ONC to be at least $\sim 5\:$Myr, i.e., about 10 free-fall times, and with a mean star formation efficiency per free-fall time of $\bar{\epsilon}_{\rm ff}\lesssim0.05$. These results favor a scenario of slow, quasi-equilibrium star cluster formation, regulated by magnetic fields and/or protostellar outflow feedback.
#### Investigating $ω(z)$ Parametrizations in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity:  Observational Constraints with Covariance Matrix Simulation

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates accelerated cosmic expansion using various cosmological models within Horava-Lifshitz gravity, including BBCCFHKO, Seljak, ASSS, PADE-I, PADE-II, and BAZS, utilizing Equation of State Parametrization. To constrain the cosmological parameters of each model, we incorporate 24 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation points, 30 Cosmic Chronometer points, 40 Type Ia Supernovae points, 24 quasar Hubble diagram points, and 162 Gamma Ray Bursts points, along with the latest Hubble constant measurement (R22). We treat $r_{d}$ as a free parameter, aiming to extract $H_{0}$ and $r_{d}$ using late-time datasets and obtain optimal fitting values for each parameter in every model. The benefits of treating $r_{d}$ as a free parameter include reduced bias, improved precision, and enhanced dataset compatibility. The resulting values of $H_{0}$ and $r_{d}$ are relative to the $\Lambda$CDM model, showcasing alignment with early Planck and SDSS estimations. We additionally minimize errors by simulating random correlations in the covariance matrix. Furthermore, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) support all models, with the $\Lambda$CDM model exhibiting the lowest AIC. Evaluation via reduced chi-square statistic confirms reasonable fits for all models. While $\Lambda$CDM remains favored, extensions warrant further investigation. This study underscores the importance of exploring alternative cosmological models to deepen our understanding of the universe's fundamental properties and evolution. Continued refinement of models is essential for advancing cosmological research.
#### Signature of the atmospheric asymmetries of hot and ultra-hot Jupiters  in lightcurves

 - **Abstract**
 With the new generation of space telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), it is possible to better characterize the atmospheres of exoplanets. The atmospheres of Hot and Ultra Hot Jupiters are highly heterogeneous and asymmetrical. The difference between the temperatures on the day-side and the night-side is especially extreme in the case of Ultra Hot Jupiters. We introduce a new tool to compute synthetic lightcurves from 3D GCM simulations, developed in the Pytmosph3R framework. We show how rotation induces a variation of the flux during the transit that is a source of information on the chemical and thermal distribution of the atmosphere. We find that the day-night gradient linked to Ultra Hot Jupiters has an effect close to the stellar limb-darkening, but opposite to tidal deformation. We confirm the impact of the atmospheric and chemical distribution on variations of the central transit time, though the variations found are smaller than that of available observational data, which could indicate that the east-west asymmetries are underestimated, due to the chemistry or clouds.
