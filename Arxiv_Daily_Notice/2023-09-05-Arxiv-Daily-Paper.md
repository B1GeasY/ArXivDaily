 - **Abstract**
 We present the first comprehensive study of a giant, $\approx \! \! 70$ kpc-scale nebula around a radio-quiet quasar at $z<1$. The analysis is based on deep integral field spectroscopy with MUSE of the field of HE$\,$0238$-$1904, a luminous quasar at $z=0.6282$. The nebula emits strongly in $\mathrm{[O \, II]}$, $\rm H \beta$, and $\mathrm{[O \, III]}$, and the quasar resides in an unusually overdense environment for a radio-quiet system. The environment likely consists of two groups which may be merging, and in total have an estimated dynamical mass of $M_{\rm dyn}\approx 4\times 10^{13}$ to $10^{14}\ {\rm M_\odot}$. The nebula exhibits largely quiescent kinematics and irregular morphology. The nebula may arise primarily through interaction-related stripping of circumgalactic and interstellar medium (CGM/ISM) of group members, with some potential contributions from quasar outflows. The simultaneous presence of the giant nebula and a radio-quiet quasar in a rich environment suggests a correlation between such circum-quasar nebulae and environmental effects. This possibility can be tested with larger samples. The upper limits on the electron number density implied by the [O\,II] doublet ratio range from $\log(n_{\rm e, [O \, II]} / \mathrm{cm^{-3}}) < 1.2$ to $2.8$. However, assuming a constant quasar luminosity and negligible projection effects, the densities implied from the measured line ratios between different ions (e.g., [O\,II], [O\,III], and [Ne V]) and photoionization simulations are often 10$-$400 times larger. This large discrepancy can be explained by quasar variability on a timescale of $\approx 10^4{-}10^5$ years.

 - **Abstract**
 The precessing jet-nozzle scenario previously proposed was applied to model-fit the kinematics of five superluminal components (C19,C20,C21,B5 and B7) of jet-B in blazar 3C345. Based on a specific pattern for the the precessing common trajectory of jet-B, the kinematic properties (including trajectory,coordinates, core separation and apparent velocity) were model-fitted and their flux evolution could be studied. Through model-simulation of their kinematic behavior, the bulk Lorentz factor, viewing angle and Doppler factor were derived as continuous functions of time and the association of their flux evolution with their Doppler-boosting effect was investigated. The 43GHz light-curves of the five superluminal components can be well interpreted in terms of their Doppler effect. The close association of their flux evolution with the Doppler-boosting effect firmly validates our precessing nozzle scenario and supports the traditional point-view that superluminal components are physical entities (traveling shocks or plasmoids) participating relativistic motion toward us at small angles. The model-simulation of kinematic behavior of superluminal components by using our precessing nozzle scenario with specific patterns (helical or ballistic) assumed for the precessing common trajectories yields the model-derived bulk Lorentz factor, apparent velocity, viewing angle and Doppler factor as continuous functions of time, which are most applicable to study the connection of flux evolution with Doppler boosting effect for the superluminal components.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Deuterium in H-bearing species is enhanced during the early stages of star formation, however, only a small number of high spatial resolution deuteration studies exist towards protostellar objects, leaving the small-scale structures unrevealed and understudied. Aims. We aim to constrain the deuterium fractionation ratios in a Class 0/I protostellar object in formaldehyde (H2CO), which has abundant deuterated isotopologues in this environment. Methods. We observed the Class 0/I protobinary system [BHB2007] 11, whose emission components are embedded in circumstellar disks that have radii of 2-3 au, using ALMA within the context of the Large Program FAUST. The system is surrounded by a complex filamentary structure connecting to the larger circumbinary disk. In this work we present the first study of formaldehyde D-fractionation towards this source with detections of H2CO 3(0,3)-2(0,2), combined with HDCO 4(2,2)-3(2,1), HDCO 4(1,4)-3(1,3) and D2CO 4(0,4)-3(0,3). These observations enable multiple velocity components associated with the methanol hotspots also uncovered by FAUST data, as well as the external envelope, to be resolved. In addition, based on the kinematics seen in the observations of the H2CO emission, we propose the presence of a second large scale outflow. Results. HDCO and D2CO are only found in the central regions of the core while H2CO is found more ubiquitously. From radiative transfer modelling, the column densities ranges found for H2CO, HDCO and D2CO are (3-8)x10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$, (0.8-2.9)x10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ and (2.6-4.3)x10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively, yielding an average D/H ratio of 0.01-0.04. Following the results of kinematic modelling, the second large scale feature is inconsistent with a streamer-like nature and we thus tentatively conclude that the feature is an asymmetric molecular outflow launched by a wide-angle disk wind.

 - **Abstract**
 Giant exoplanets seem to have on average a much larger heavy element content than the solar system giants. Past attempts to explain these heavy element contents include collisions between planets, accretion of volatile rich gas and accretion of gas enriched in micro-metre sized solids. However, these different theories individually could not explain the heavy element content of giants and the volatile to refractory ratios in atmospheres of giant planets at the same time. Here we combine the approaches of gas accretion enhanced with vapor and small micro-meter sized dust grains. As pebbles drift inwards, the volatile component evaporates and enriches the disc, while the smaller silicate core of the pebble continues to move inwards. The smaller silicate pebbles drift slower, leading to a pile-up of material interior to the water ice line, increasing the dust-to-gas ratio interior to the ice line. Under the assumption that these small dust grains follow the motion of the gas, gas accreting giants accrete large fractions of small solids in addition to the volatile vapor. The effectiveness of the solid enrichment requires a large disc radius to maintain the pebble flux for a long time and a large viscosity that reduces the size and inward drift of the small dust grains. However, this process depends crucially on the debated size difference of the pebbles interior and exterior of the water ice line. On the other hand, the volatile component released by the inward drifting pebbles can lead to a large enrichment with heavy element vapor, independently of a size difference of pebbles interior and exterior to the water ice line. Our model stresses the importance of the disc's radius and viscosity on the enrichment of dust and vapor. Consequently we show how our model could explain the heavy element content of the majority of giant planets by using combined estimates of dust and vapor enrichment.

 - **Abstract**
 The point-spread function (PSF) is a fundamental property of any astronomical instrument. In interferometers, differing array configurations combined with their $uv$ coverage, and various weighting schemes can produce an irregular but deterministic PSF. As a result, the PSF is often deconvolved using CLEAN-style algorithms to improve image fidelity. In this paper, we revisit a significant effect that causes the flux densities measured with any interferometer to be systematically offset from the true values. Using a suite of carefully controlled simulations, we show that the systematic offset originates from a mismatch in the units of the image produced by these CLEAN-style algorithms. We illustrate that this systematic error can be significant, ranging from a few to tens of per cent. Accounting for this effect is important for current and future interferometric arrays, such as MeerKAT, LOFAR and the SKA, whose core-dominated configuration naturally causes an irregular PSF. We show that this offset is independent of other systematics, and can worsen due to some factors such as the goodness of the fit to the PSF, the deconvolution depth, and the signal-to-noise of the source. Finally, we present several methods that can reduce this effect to just a few per cent.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of Type Ia Supernova (SN Ia) explosions remains an open issue, with several contending progenitor scenarios actively being considered. One such scenario involves a SN Ia explosion inside a planetary nebula (PN) in the aftermath of a stellar merger triggered by a common envelope (CE) episode. We examine this scenario using hydrodynamic and non-equilibrium ionization simulations of the interaction between the SN ejecta and the PN cocoon into the supernova remnant (SNR) phase, focusing on the impact of the delay between the CE episode and the SN explosion. We compare the bulk dynamics and X-ray spectra of our simulated SNRs to the observed properties of known Type Ia SNRs in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds. We conclude that models where the SN explosion happens in the immediate aftermath of the CE episode (with a delay $\lesssim$1,000 yr) are hard to reconcile with the observations, because the interaction with the dense PN cocoon results in ionization timescales much higher than those found in any known Type Ia SNR. Models with a longer delay between the CE episode and the SN explosion ($\sim$10,000 yr) are closer to the observations, and may be able to explain the bulk properties of some Type Ia SNRs.
