 - **Abstract**
 Interactions between exoplanetary atmospheres and internal properties have long been hypothesized to be drivers of the inflation mechanisms of gaseous planets and apparent atmospheric chemical disequilibrium conditions. However, transmission spectra of exoplanets has been limited in its ability to observational confirm these theories due to the limited wavelength coverage of HST and inferences of single molecules, mostly H$_2$O. In this work, we present the panchromatic transmission spectrum of the approximately 750 K, low-density, Neptune-sized exoplanet WASP-107b using a combination of HST WFC3, JWST NIRCam and MIRI. From this spectrum, we detect spectroscopic features due to H$_2$O (21$\sigma$), CH$_4$ (5$\sigma$), CO (7$\sigma$), CO$_2$ (29$\sigma$), SO$_2$ (9$\sigma$), and NH$_3$ (6$\sigma$). The presence of these molecules enable constraints on the atmospheric metal enrichment (M/H is 10--18$\times$ Solar), vertical mixing strength (log$_{10}$K$_{zz}$=8.4--9.0 cm$^2$s$^{-1}$), and internal temperature ($>$345 K). The high internal temperature is suggestive of tidally-driven inflation acting upon a Neptune-like internal structure, which can naturally explain the planet's large radius and low density. These findings suggest that eccentricity driven tidal heating is a critical process governing atmospheric chemistry and interior structure inferences for a majority of the cool ($<$1,000K) super-Earth-to-Saturn mass exoplanet population.

 - **Abstract**
 This study delves into [W60] B90, one of the most luminous and extreme Red Supergiants (RSGs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), aiming to search for evidence of episodic mass loss. Our discovery of a bar-like nebular structure at 1 pc, reminiscent of the bar around Betelgeuse, raised the question of whether [W60] B90 also has a bow shock. We collected and analyzed proper motion data from Gaia, as well as new multi-epoch spectroscopic and imaging data, and archival time-series photometry in the optical and mid-infrared. We found [W60] B90 to be a walkaway star, with a supersonic peculiar velocity in the direction of the bar. We detected shocked emission between the bar and the star, based on the [S II]/H$\alpha$ > 0.4 criterion, providing strong evidence for a bow shock. The 30-year optical light curve revealed semi-regular variability, showing three similar dimming events with $\Delta V \sim 1$ mag, a recurrence of $\sim$12 yr, and a rise time of 400 d. We found the mid-IR light curve to vary by 0.51 mag and 0.37 mag in the WISE1 and WISE2 bands, respectively, and by 0.42 mag and 0.25 mag during the last dimming event. During this event, optical spectroscopy revealed spectral variability (M3I to M4I), a correlation between the $T_{\rm eff}$ and the brightness, increased extinction, and, after the minimum, spectral features incompatible with the models. We also found a difference of >300 K between the $T_{\rm eff}$ measured from the TiO bands in the optical and the atomic lines from our $J$-band spectroscopy. We inferred that [W60] B90 is a more massive analog of Betelgeuse in the LMC and the first extragalactic single RSG with a suspected bow shock. Its high luminosity $\log(L/L_{\odot})=5.32$ dex, mass-loss rate, and mid-IR variability compared to other RSGs in the LMC, indicate that it is in an unstable evolutionary state undergoing episodes of mass loss.

          (Re)mind the gap: a hiatus in star formation history unveiled by APOGEE DR17

 - **Abstract**
 The analysis of several spectroscopic surveys indicates the presence of a bimodality between the disc stars in the abundance ratio space of [${\alpha}$/Fe] versus [Fe/H]. The two stellar groups are commonly referred to as the high-${\alpha}$ and low-${\alpha}$ sequences. Some models capable of reproducing such a bimodality, invoke the presence of a hiatus in the star formation history in our Galaxy, whereas other models explain the two sequences by means of stellar migration. Our aim is to show that the existence of the gap in the star formation rate between high-$\alpha$ and low-$\alpha$ is evident in the stars of APOGEE DR17, if one plots [Fe/$\alpha$] versus [$\alpha$/H], thus confirming previous suggestions by Gratton et al. (1996) and Fuhrmann (1998). Then we try to interpret the data by means of detailed chemical models. We compare the APOGEE DR17 red giant stars with the predictions of a detailed chemical evolution model based on the two-infall paradigm, taking also into account possible accretion of dwarf satellites. The APOGEE DR17 abundance ratios [Fe/$\alpha$] versus [$\alpha$/H] exhibit a sharp increase of [Fe/$\alpha$] at a nearly constant [$\alpha$/H] (where $\alpha$ elements considered are Mg, Si, O) during the transition between the two disc phases. This observation strongly supports the hypothesis that a hiatus in star formation occurred during this evolutionary phase. Notably, the most pronounced growth in the [Fe/$\alpha$] versus [$\alpha$/H] relation is observed for oxygen, as this element is exclusively synthesised in core-collapse supernovae. A chemical model predicting a stop in the star formation of a duration of roughly 3.5 Gyr, and where the high-$\alpha$ disc starts forming from pre-enriched gas by a previous encounter with a dwarf galaxy can well explain the observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of transiting gas giant exoplanets have revealed a pervasive depletion of methane, which has only recently been identified atmospherically. The depletion is thought to be maintained by disequilibrium processes such as photochemistry or mixing from a hotter interior. However, the interiors are largely unconstrained along with the vertical mixing strength and only upper limits on the CH$_4$ depletion have been available. The warm Neptune WASP-107 b stands out among exoplanets with an unusually low density, reported low core mass, and temperatures amenable to CH$_4$ though previous observations have yet to find the molecule. Here we present a JWST NIRSpec transmission spectrum of WASP-107 b which shows features from both SO$_2$ and CH$_4$ along with H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and CO. We detect methane with 4.2$\sigma$ significance at an abundance of 1.0$\pm$0.5 ppm, which is depleted by 3 orders of magnitude relative to equilibrium expectations. Our results are highly constraining for the atmosphere and interior, which indicate the envelope has a super-solar metallicity of 43$\pm$8$\times$ solar, a hot interior with an intrinsic temperature of T$_{\rm int}$=460$\pm$40 K, and vigorous vertical mixing which depletes CH4 with a diffusion coefficient of Kzz = 10$^{11.6\pm0.1}$ cm$^2$/s. Photochemistry has a negligible effect on the CH$_4$ abundance, but is needed to account for the SO$_2$. We infer a core mass of 11.5$_{-3.6}^{+3.0}$ M$_{\odot}$, which is much higher than previous upper limits, releasing a tension with core-accretion models.

 - **Abstract**
 Henize 2-10 is a dwarf galaxy experiencing positive black hole (BH) feedback from a radio-detected low-luminosity active galactic nucleus. Previous Green Bank Telescope (GBT) observations detected a H2O "kilomaser" in Henize 2-10, but the low angular resolution (33") left the location and origin of the maser ambiguous. We present new Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations of the H2O maser line at 22.23508 GHz in Henize 2-10 with ~2" resolution. These observations reveal two maser sources distinct in position and velocity. The first maser source is spatially coincident with the known BH outflow and the region of triggered star formation ~70 pc to the east. Combined with the broad width of the maser (W50 ~ 66 km s-1), this confirms our hypothesis that part of the maser detected with the GBT is produced by the impact of the BH outflow shocking the dense molecular gas along the flow and at the interface of the eastern star-forming region. The second maser source lies to the south-east far from the central BH and has a narrow width (W50 ~ 8 km s-1), suggesting a star-formation-related origin. This work has revealed the nature of the H2O kilomaser in Henize 2-10 and illustrates the first known connection between outflow-driven H2O masers and positive BH feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic center lobe (GCL) is an object ~1° across that is located north of the Galactic center. In the mid-infrared (MIR) the GCL appears as two 8.0${\mu}$m filaments between which is strong 24${\mu}$m and radio continuum emission. Due to its morphology and location in the sky, previous authors have argued that the GCL is located in the Galactic center region, created by outflows from star formation or by activity of the central black hole Sagittarius A*. In an associated paper (Hurley-Walker et al., 2024, in press), low-frequency radio emission indicates that the GCL must instead lie foreground to the Galactic center. If the GCL is foreground to the Galactic center, it is likely to be a type of object common throughout the Galactic disk; we here investigate whether its properties are similar to those of Galactic HII regions. We find that the GCL's MIR morphology, MIR flux densities, dust temperatures, and radio recombination line (RRL) properties as traced by the GBT Diffuse Ionized Gas Survey (GDIGS) are consistent with those of known Galactic HII regions, although the derived electron temperature is low. We search for the ionizing source(s) of the possible HII region and identify a stellar cluster candidate (Camargo #1092/Ryu & Lee #532) and a cluster of young stellar objects (SPICY G359.3+0.3) whose members have Gaia parallaxes distances of 1.7${\pm}$0.4kpc. Taken together, the results of our companion paper and those shown here suggest that the GCL has properties consistent with those of an HII region located ~2kpc from the Sun.

 - **Abstract**
 An hourglass-shaped magnetic field pattern arises naturally from the gravitational collapse of a star-forming gas cloud. Most studies have focused on the prestellar collapse phase, when the structure has a smooth and monotonic radial profile. However, most observations target dense clouds that already contain a central protostar, and possibly a circumstellar disk. We utilize an analytic treatment of the magnetic field along with insights gained from simulations to develop a more realistic magnetic field model for the protostellar phase. Key elements of the model are a strong radial magnetic field in the region of rapid collapse, an off-center peak in the magnetic field strength (a consequence of magnetic field dissipation in the circumstellar disk), and a strong toroidal field that is generated in the region of rapid collapse and outflow generation. A model with a highly pinched and twisted magnetic field pattern in the inner collapse zone facilitates the interpretation of magnetic field patterns observed in protostellar clouds.

          Spectroscopic Survey of Faint Planetary-Nebula Nuclei. V. The EGB 6-Type Central Star of Abell 57

 - **Abstract**
 During our spectroscopic survey of central stars of faint planetary nebulae (PNe), we found that the nucleus of Abell 57 exhibits strong nebular emission lines. Using synthetic narrow-band images, we show that the emission arises from an unresolved compact emission knot (CEK) coinciding with the hot (90,000 K) central star. Thus Abell 57 belongs to the rare class of "EGB 6-type" PNe, characterized by dense emission cores. Photometric data show that the nucleus exhibits a near-IR excess, due to a dusty companion body with the luminosity of an M0 dwarf but a temperature of ~1800 K. Emission-line analysis reveals that the CEK is remarkably dense (electron density ~1.6x10**7 cm**-3), and has a radius of only ~4.5 AU. The CEK suffers considerably more reddening than the central star, which itself is more reddened than the surrounding PN. These puzzles may suggest an interaction between the knot and central star; however, Hubble Space Telescope imaging of EGB 6 itself shows that its CEK lies more than ~125 AU from the PN nucleus. We discuss a scenario in which a portion of the AGB wind that created the PN was captured into a dust cloud around a distant stellar companion; this cloud has survived to the present epoch, and has an atmosphere photoionized by radiation from the hot central star. However, in this picture EGB 6-type nuclei should be relatively common, yet they are actually extremely rare; thus they may arise from a different transitory phenomenon. We suggest future observations of Abell 57 that may help unravel its mysteries.

          The IACOB project: CVIII. Hunting for spectroscopic binaries in the O and B supergiant domain.The threat of pulsational variability

 - **Abstract**
 Observations have definitively strengthened the long-standing assertion that binaries are crucial in massive star evolution. While the percentage of spectroscopic binary systems among main-sequence O stars is well-studied, other phases of massive star evolution remain less explored. We aim to estimate the spectroscopic binary fraction in Galactic late O- and B-type supergiants (OB-Sgs) and set empirical thresholds in radial velocity (RV) to avoid misidentifying pulsating stars as single-line spectroscopic binaries. Using over 4500 high-resolution spectra of 56 Galactic OB-Sgs (plus 13 O dwarfs/subgiants and 5 early-B giants) from the IACOB project (2008-2020), we apply Gaussian fitting and centroid computation techniques to measure RV for each spectrum. Our findings reveal that intrinsic variability in OB-Sgs can result in peak-to-peak RV amplitudes (RVpp) of up to 20-25 km/s, notably in late-O and early-B Sgs, and decreases to typical values of RVpp in the range of 1-5 km/s for O dwarfs and 2-15 km/s for late B-Sgs. Considering these results and evaluating line-profile variability in each star, we find that 10$\pm$4% of OB-Sgs are clearly single-line spectroscopic binaries. In addition, we find that the percentage of double-line spectroscopic binaries in late O- and early B-Sgs is ~6%, much lower than the ~30% in O-type dwarfs and giants. This study, along with prior research on B-Sgs in the 30 Doradus region of the LMC, indicates that the spectroscopic binary percentage decreases by a factor of 4-5 from O stars to B-Sgs. Our study underscores the need for a thorough characterization of spectroscopic variability due to intrinsic sources to reliably determine the spectroscopic binary fraction among OB-Sgs and O-type stars in general, offering valuable insights into the impact of binaries on massive star evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new CO observation toward the Type Ia supernova remnant (SNR) 3C 397 using the Nobeyama 45-m radio telescope at an unprecedent angular resolution of $\sim$18''. We newly found that the CO cloud at $V_{\mathrm{LSR}}$ = 55.7-62.2 km s$^{-1}$ (60 km s$^{-1}$ cloud) shows a good spatial correspondence with the radio continuum shell. We also found an expanding gas motion of the 60 km s$^{-1}$ cloud with an expansion velocity of $\sim$3 km s$^{-1}$, which is thought to be formed by the pre-and/or post-supernova feedback. By considering the positions of Galactic spiral arms and the X-ray/HI absorption studies, we concluded that 3C 397 is physically associated with the 60 km s$^{-1}$ cloud rather than the previously known CO cloud at $V_{\mathrm{LSR}}$ $\sim$30 km s$^{-1}$. Given that the previously measured pre-shock density is $\sim$2-5 cm$^{-3}$, the expanding motion of the 60 km s$^{-1}$ cloud was likely formed by the pre-supernova feedback known as optically thick wind. The scenario is consistent with that 3C 397 exploded inside a wind-blown bubble as a single degenerate system.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of Keplerian rotation is rare among Class 0 protostellar systems. We have investigated the high-density tracer HCN as a probe of the inner disk in a Class 0 proto-brown dwarf candidate. Our ALMA high angular resolution observations show the peak in the HCN (3-2) line emission arises from a compact component near the proto-brown dwarf with a small bar-like structure and a deconvolved size of $\sim$50 au. Radiative transfer modelling indicates that this HCN feature is tracing the innermost, dense regions in the proto-brown dwarf where a small Keplerian disk is expected to be present. The limited velocity resolution of the observations, however, makes it difficult to confirm the rotational kinematics of this feature. A brightening in the HCN emission towards the core center suggests that HCN can survive in the gas phase in the inner, dense regions of the proto-brown dwarf. In contrast, modelling of the HCO$^{+}$ (3-2) line emission indicates that it originates from the outer pseudo-disk/envelope region and is centrally depleted. HCN line emission can reveal the small-scale structures and can be an efficient observational tool to study the inner disk properties in such faint compact objects where spatially resolving the disk is nearly impossible.

          Detection and Prediction of Future Massive Black Hole Mergers with Machine Learning and Truncated Waveforms

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel machine learning framework tailored to detect massive black hole binaries observed by spaceborne gravitational wave detectors like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and predict their future merger times. The detection is performed via convolutional neural networks that analyze time-evolving Time-Delay Interferometry (TDI) spectrograms and utilize variations in signal power to trigger alerts. The prediction of future merger times is accomplished with reinforcement learning. Here, the proposed algorithm dynamically refines time-to-merger predictions by assimilating new data as it becomes available. Deep Q-learning serves as the core technique of the approach, utilizing a neural network to estimate Q-values throughout the observational state space. To enhance robust learning in a noisy environment, we integrate an actor-critic mechanism that segregates action proposals from their evaluation, thus harnessing the advantages of policy-based and value-based learning paradigms. We leverage merger estimation obtained via template matching with truncated waveforms to generate rewards for the reinforcement learning agent. These estimations come with uncertainties, which magnify as the merger event stretches further into the future. The reinforcement learning setup is shown to adapt to these uncertainties by employing a policy fine-tuning approach, ensuring the reliability of predictions despite the varying degrees of template-matching precision. The algorithm denotes a first step toward a low-latency model that provides early warnings for impending transient phenomena. By delivering timely and accurate forecasts of merger events, the framework supports the coordination of gravitational wave observations with accompanied electromagnetic counterparts, thus enhancing the prospects of multi-messenger astronomy. We use the LISA Spritz data challenge for validation.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the effects of massive primordial black holes (PBHs) on cosmic structure formation, employing both a semi-analytical approach and cosmological simulations. Our simulations incorporate PBHs with a monochromatic mass distribution centered around $10^6 \ \rm M_{\odot}$, constituting a fraction of $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-4}$ of the dark matter (DM) in the universe, with the remainder being collision-less particle dark matter (PDM). Additionally, we conduct a $\Lambda$CDM simulation for comparative analysis with runs that include PBHs. At smaller scales, halos containing PBHs exhibit similar density and velocity dispersion profiles to those without PBHs. Conversely, at larger scales, PBHs can expedite the formation of massive halos and reside at their centers due to the `seed effect'. To analyze the relative distribution of PBH host halos compared to non-PBH halos, we apply nearest-neighbor (NN) statistics. Our results suggest that PBH host halos, through gravitational influence, significantly impact the structure formation process, compared to the $\Lambda$CDM case, by attracting and engulfing nearby newly-formed minihalos. Should PBHs constitute a fraction of DM significantly larger than $\sim$$10^{-3}$, almost all newly-formed halos will be absorbed by PBH-seeded halos. Consequently, our simulations predict a bimodal feature in the halo mass function, with most of the massive halos containing at least one PBH at their core and the rest being less massive non-PBH halos.

          Solar image quality assessment: a proof of concept using Variance of Laplacian method and its application to optical atmospheric condition monitoring

 - **Abstract**
 Here we present a proof of concept for the application of the Variance of Laplacian (VL) method in quantifying the sharpness of optical solar images. We conducted a comprehensive study using over 65,000 individual solar images acquired on more than 160 days. Each image underwent processing using a VL image processing algorithm, which assigns a 'score' based on the sharpness of the solar disk's edges. We studied the scores obtained from images acquired at different conditions. Our findings demonstrate that the sharpness of the images exhibits daily trends that are closely linked to the altitude of the Sun at the observation site. We observed a significant degradation in image quality only below a certain altitude threshold. Furthermore, we compared airmass formulae from the literature with our sharpness observations and concluded that the degradation could be modeled as an Image Sharpness Function (ISF), which exhibits similarities to airmass variations. In addition to assessing image quality, our method has the potential to evaluate the optical atmospheric conditions during daytime observations. Moreover, this technique can be easily and cost-effectively applied to archival or real-time images of other celestial bodies, such as the Moon, bright planets and defocused stars. Given that ISF is unique to each location and sensitive to sky conditions, the development of an ISF is not only beneficial for routine observation preparation but also essential for long-term site monitoring.

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic center lobe (GCL) is a $\sim 1^\circ$ object located north of the Galactic center. In the mid-infrared (MIR), the GCL appears as two 8.0-micron filaments that roughly define an ellipse. There is strong 24-micron and radio continuum emission in the interior of the ellipse. Due to its morphology and location in the sky, previous authors have argued that the GCL is created by outflows from star formation in the central molecular zone or by activity of the central black hole Sgr~A$^*$. We present images of the GCL from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array survey in radio continuum that show thermal absorption against the Galactic center, incompatible with an interpretation of synchrotron self-absorption. Estimates of the cosmic ray emissivity in this direction allow us to place a distance constraint on the GCL. To be consistent with standard emissivity assumptions, the GCL would be located 2kpc away. At a distance of 8kpc, the synchrotron background emissivity is enhanced by $\sim75$% in the direction of the GCL. We also present radio recombination line data from the Green Bank Telescope that constrains the electron temperature and line widths in this region, which are also more explicable if the GCL lies relatively close.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the impacts of magnetic field on the neutrino transport inside core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Magnetic field quantizes the momentum of electrons and positrons, resulting in the modification of weak-interaction cross sections and the chemical potentials of electrons and positrons. We include these changes in the leakage scheme of neutrino transport and perform 1D CCSN simulations with GR1D, assuming the postbounce magnetic field strength of $10^{16-17}$ G. The results show that the neutrino opacities are enhanced due to the amplified interaction rates, resulting in a larger neutrinosphere. This further reduces the peak value of neutrino luminosities and their decay rates since neutrinos stay longer inside the neutrinosphere. Meanwhile, the neutrino mean energies are smaller shortly after bounce and reach their peak values at later times. As these neutrino properties are crucial in subsequent nucleosynthesis processes, including the $\nu$p-process, $\nu$-process, and $r$-process, our findings suggest that the magnetic field may leave discernible marks on the abundance pattern of nucleosynthesis in CCSN.

 - **Abstract**
 Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs) are very important massive stars. However, their origin and the observed binary fraction within the entire WR population are still debated. We investigate some possible merger channels for the formation of WRs, including main sequence (MS)/ Hertzsprung Gap (HG) + MS, He + HG/ Giant Branch (GB). We find that many products produced via binary merger can evolve into WRs, the MS/ HG + MS merger channel can explain WRs with luminosities higher than $\sim 10^{5.4}$\,L$_{\odot}$, while the He + HG/ GB merger channel can explain low-luminosity WRs in the range of $10^{4.7}$\,L$_{\odot}$\,$\sim$\,$10^{5.5}$\,L$_{\odot}$. In the population synthesis analysis of WRs, we assume an initial binary fraction ($f_{\rm ini,bin}$) of 50\% and 100\% for massive stars. We also assume that MS/ HG + MS merger products are non-rotating or rapidly rotating ($\omega/\omega_{\rm crit}=0.8$). In different cases, the calculated single fractions of WRs range from $22.2\%$ to $60.6\%$ in the Milky Way (MW) and from $8.3\%$ to $70.9\%$ in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The current observations fall within the range of our calculations. When the merger product of MS/HG+MS rotates rapidly, we estimate that there are approximately 1015 to 1396 WRs in the MW and 128 to 204 WRs in the LMC. Our model also roughly reproduces the observed single-peak luminosity distribution of WRs in the MW. However, the weak bimodal luminosity distribution observed in the LMC is not reproduced in our model. We assess that this may be due to the model underestimating the mass-loss rate in the LMC. In conclusion, we consider that the binary merger is significant formation channel for WR formation, and can explain the observed high fraction of the single WRs in the total population.

 - **Abstract**
 Maps of polarized dust emission of molecular clouds reveal the morphology of the magnetic field associated with star-forming regions. In particular, polarization maps of hub-filament systems show the distortion of magnetic field lines induced by gas flows onto and inside filaments. We aim to understand the relation between the curvature of magnetic field lines associated with filaments in hub-filament systems and the properties of the underlying gas flows. We consider steady-state models of gas with finite electrical resistivity flowing across a transverse magnetic field. We derive the relation between the bending of the field lines and the flow parameters represented by the Alfvén Mach number and the magnetic Reynolds number. We find that, on the scale of the filaments, the relevant parameter for a gas of finite electrical resistivity is the magnetic Reynolds number, and we derive the relation between the deflection angle of the field from the initial direction (assumed perpendicular to the filament) and the value of the electrical resistivity, due to either Ohmic dissipation or ambipolar diffusion. Application of this model to specific observations of polarized dust emission in filamentary clouds shows that magnetic Reynolds numbers of a few tens are required to reproduce the data. Despite significant uncertainties in the observations (the flow speed, the geometry and orientation of the filament), and the idealization of the model, the specific cases considered show that ambipolar diffusion can provide the resistivity needed to maintain a steady state flow across magnetic fields of significant strength over realistic time scales.

 Filamentary structure is important for the ISM and star formation. Galactic distribution of filaments may regulate the star formation rate in the Milky Way. However, interstellar filaments are intrinsically complex, making it difficult to study quantitatively. Here, we focus on linear filaments, the simplest morphology that can be treated as building blocks of any filamentary structure. We present the first catalog of 42 ``straight-line'' filaments across the full Galactic plane, identified by clustering of far-IR Herschel HiGAL clumps in position-position-velocity space. We use molecular line cubes to investigate the dynamics along the filaments; compare the filaments with Galactic spiral arms; and compare ambient magnetic fields with the filaments' orientation. The selected filaments show extreme linearity ($>$10), aspect ratio (7-48), and velocity coherence over a length of 3-40 pc (mostly $>$10 pc). About 1/3 of them are associated with spiral arms, but only one is located in arm center, a.k.a. ``bones'' of the Milky Way. A few of them extend perpendicular to the Galactic plane, and none is located in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) near the Galactic center. Along the filaments, prevalent periodic oscillation (both in velocity and density) is consistent with gas flows channeled by the filaments and feeding the clumps which harbor diverse star formation activities. No correlation is found between the filament orientations with Planck measured global magnetic field lines. This work highlights some of the fundamental properties of molecular filaments and provides a golden sample for follow-up studies on star formation, ISM structure, and Milky Way structure.

 - **Abstract**
 The interaction between stellar winds and the partially ionized local interstellar medium (LISM) is quite common in astrophysics. However, the main difficulty in describing the neutral components lies in the fact that the mean free path of an interstellar atom, l, can be comparable to the characteristic size of an astrosphere, L (i.e., the Knudsen number, which is equal to l/L, is approximately equal to 1, as in the case of the heliosphere). In such cases, a single-fluid approximation becomes invalid, and a kinetic description must be used for the neutral component. In this study, we consider a general astrosphere and use a kinetic-gas dynamics model to investigate how the global structure of the astrosphere depends on the Knudsen number. We present numerical results covering an extremely wide range of Knudsen numbers (from 0.0001 to 100). Additionally, we explore the applicability of single-fluid approaches for modeling astrospheres of various sizes. We have excluded the influence of interstellar and stellar magnetic fields in our model to make parametric study of the kinetic effects feasible. The main conclusion of this work is that, for large astrospheres (with a distance to the bow shock greater than 600 AU) a heated rarefied plasma layer forms in the outer shock layer near the astropause. The formation of this layer is linked to localized heating of the plasma by atoms (specifically, ENAs) that undergo charge exchange again behind the astropause. This process significantly alters the flow structure in the outer shock layer and the location of the bow shock, and it cannot be described by a single-fluid model. Additionally, this paper discusses how atoms weaken the bow shocks at near-heliospheric conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 The sensitivity of the MeerKAT radio interferometer is an opportunity to probe deeper into the population of rare and faint extragalactic pulsars. The TRAPUM (TRAnsients and PUlsars with MeerKAT) collaboration has conducted a radio-domain search for accelerated pulsars and transients in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). This partially targeted survey, performed at L-band (856-1712 MHz) with the core array of the MeerKAT telescope in 2-h integrations, is twice as sensitive as the latest SMC radio pulsar survey. We report the discovery of seven new SMC pulsars, doubling this galaxy's radio pulsar population and increasing the total extragalactic population by nearly a quarter. We also carried out a search for accelerated millisecond pulsars in the SMC Globular Cluster NGC 121 using the full array of MeerKAT. This improved the previous upper limit on pulsed radio emission from this cluster by a factor of six. Our discoveries reveal the first radio pulsar-PWN systems in the SMC, with only one such system previously known outside our galaxy (the "Crab pulsar twin" in the Large Magellanic Cloud, PSR J0540$-$6919). We associate the 59 ms pulsar discovery PSR J0040$-$7337, now the fastest spinning radio pulsar in the SMC, with the bow-shock Pulsar Wind Nebula (PWN) of Supernova Remnant DEM S5. We also present a new young pulsar with a 79 ms period, PSR J0048$-$7317, in a PWN recently discovered in a MeerKAT radio continuum image. Using the multi-beam capability of MeerKAT, we localised our pulsar discoveries, and two previous Murriyang discoveries, to a positional uncertainty of a few arcseconds.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of silicon monosulfide (SiS) in space appears to be a difficult process, but the present work is showing that a previously excluded pathway may contribute to its astronomical abundance. Reaction of the radicals SH + SiH produces SiS with a submerged transition state and generates a stabilizing H$_2$ molecule as a product to dissipate the kinetic energy. Such is a textbook chemical reaction for favorable gas-phase chemistry. While previously proposed mechanisms reacting atomic sulfur and silicon with SiH, SH, and H$_2$S will still be major contributors to the production of SiS, an abundance of SiS in certain regions could be a marker for the presence of SiH where it has previously been unobserved. These quantum chemically-computed reaction profiles imply that the silicon-chalcogen chemistry of molecular clouds, shocked regions, or protoplanetary disks may be richer than previously thought. Quantum chemical spectral data for the intermediate cis- and trans-HSiSH are also provided in order to aid in their potential spectroscopic characterization.

          Asteroseismic measurement of core and envelope rotation rates for 2006 red giant branch stars

 - **Abstract**
 Tens of thousands of red giant stars in the Kepler data exhibit solar-like oscillations. Their oscillations enable us to study the internal physics from core to surface, such as differential rotation. However, envelope rotation rates have been measured for only a dozen RGB stars so far. The limited sample hinders the theoretical interpretation of angular momentum transport in post-main-sequence phases. We apply a new approach to calculate the asymptotic frequencies of mixed modes, which accounts for the so-called near-degeneracy effects and leads to more proper measurements of envelope rotation rates. By fitting these asymptotic expressions to the observations, we obtain measurements of the properties of g modes and mean core and envelope rotation rates. Among 2495 stars with clear mixed-mode patterns, we found that 800 show doublets and 1206 show triplets, doubling the size of pre-existing catalogues. This led us to discover an over-density of stars that narrowly distribute around a well-defined ridge in the plane showing core rotation rate versus evolution along the RGB. With this work, we also increase the sample of stars with measured envelope rotation rates by two orders of magnitude. We find a decreasing trend between envelope rotation rates and evolution, implying that the envelopes slow down with expansion, as expected. We find 243 stars whose envelope rotation rates are significantly larger than zero. For these stars, the core-to-envelope rotation ratios are around 20 and show a large spread with evolution. Several stars show extremely mild differential rotations, with core-to-surface ratios between 1 and 2. These stars also have very slow core rotation rates, suggesting that they go through a peculiar rotational evolution. We also discovered more stars located below the degeneracy sequence, which will provide the opportunity to study the history of possible stellar mergers.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays (CRs) interact with turbulent magnetic fields in the intestellar medium, generating nonthermal emission. After many decades of studies, the theoretical understanding of their diffusion in the ISM continues to pose a challenge. This study numerically explores a recent prediction termed "mirror diffusion" and its synergy with traditional diffusion mechanism based on gyroresonant scattering. Our study combines 3D MHD simulations of star-forming regions with test particle simulations to analyze CR diffusion. We demonstrate the significance of mirror diffusion in CR diffusion parallel to the magnetic field, when the mirroring condition is satisfied. Our results support the theoretical expectation that the resulting particle propagation arising from mirror diffusion in combination with much faster diffusion induced by gyroresonant scattering resembles a Levy-flight-like propagation. Our study highlights the necessity to reevaluate the diffusion coefficients traditionally adopeted in the ISM based on gyroresonant scattering alone. For instance, our simulations imply a diffusion coefficient $\sim10^{27}cm^2/s$ for particles with a few hundred TeV within regions spanning a few parsecs around the source. This estimate is in agreement with gamma-ray observations, which shows the relevance of our results for understanding of diffuse gamma-ray emission in star-forming regions.

          Feedback-regulated Seed Black Hole Growth in Star-Forming Molecular Clouds and Galactic Nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in high-redshift luminous quasars may require a phase of rapid accretion, and as a precondition, substantial gas influx toward seed black holes (BHs) from kilo-parsec or parsec scales. Our previous research demonstrated the plausibility of such gas supply for BH seeds within star-forming giant molecular clouds (GMCs) with high surface density ($\sim 10^4\,{\rm {\rm M_\odot}\, pc}^{-2}$), facilitating ``hyper-Eddington'' accretion via efficient feeding by dense clumps which are driven by turbulence and stellar feedback. This article investigates the impacts of feedback from accreting BHs on this process, including radiation, mechanical jets, and highly relativistic cosmic rays. We run a suite of numerical simulations to explore diverse parameter spaces of BH feedback, including the sub-grid accretion model, feedback energy efficiency, mass loading factor, and initial metallicity. Utilizing radiative feedback models inferred from the slim disk, we find that hyper-Eddington accretion is still achievable, yielding BH bolometric luminosities as high as $10^{41}$ -- $10^{44}\,\rm erg/s$, depending on the GMC properties and specific feedback model assumed. We find the maximum possible mass growth of seed BHs ($\Delta M_{\rm BH}^{\rm max}$) is regulated by the momentum deposition rate from BH feedback, $\dot{p}_{\rm feedback}/(\dot{M}_{\rm BH} c)$, which leads to an analytic scaling that agrees well with simulations. This scenario predicts the rapid formation of $\sim 10^4\,\rm M_\odot$ intermediate-massive BHs (IMBHs) from stellar-mass BHs within $\sim \rm Myr$. Furthermore, we examine the impacts of sub-grid accretion models and how BH feedback may influence star formation within these cloud complexes.
