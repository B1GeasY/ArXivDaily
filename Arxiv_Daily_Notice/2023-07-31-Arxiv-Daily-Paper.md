 - **Abstract**
 We study the formation of Pop III stars by performing radiation hydrodynamics simulations for three different initial clouds extracted from cosmological hydrodynamics simulations. Starting from the cloud collapse stage, we follow the growth of protostars by accretion for $\sim 10^5$ yr until the radiative feedback from the protostars suppresses the accretion and the stellar properties are nearly fixed. We find that the Pop III stars form in massive and wide binaries/small-multiple stellar systems, with masses $>30\,M_\odot$ and separations $>2000$ au. We also find that the properties of the final stellar system correlate with those of the initial clouds: the total mass increases with the cloud-scale accretion rate, and the angular momentum of the binary orbit matches that of the initial cloud. While the total mass of the system in our simulations is consistent with our previous single-star formation simulations, individual masses are lower due to mass sharing, suggesting potential modification in the extent of feedback from Pop III stars in the subsequent evolution of the Universe. We also identify such systems as mini-binaries embedded in a wider outer multiple-star system, which could evolve into progenitors for observed gravitational wave events.

 - **Abstract**
 NASA is engaged in planning for a Habitable Worlds Observatory (HabWorlds), a coronagraphic space mission to detect rocky planets in habitable zones and establish their habitability. Surface liquid water is central to the definition of planetary habitability. Photometric and polarimetric phase curves of starlight reflected by an exoplanet can reveal ocean glint, rainbows and other phenomena caused by scattering by clouds or atmospheric gas. Direct imaging missions are optimised for planets near quadrature, but HabWorlds' coronagraph may obscure the phase angles where such optical features are strongest. The range of accessible phase angles for a given exoplanet will depend on the planet's orbital inclination and/or the coronagraph's inner working angle (IWA). We use a recently-created catalog relevant to HabWorlds of 164 stars to estimate the number of exo-Earths that could be searched for ocean glint, rainbows, and polarization effects due to Rayleigh scattering. We find that the polarimetric Rayleigh scattering peak is accessible in most of the exo-Earth planetary systems. The rainbow due to water clouds at phase angles of ${\sim}20-60^\circ$ would be accessible with HabWorlds for a planet with an Earth equivalent instellation in ${\sim}{46}$ systems, while the ocean glint signature at phase angles of ${\sim}130-170^\circ$ would be accessible in ${\sim}{16}$ systems, assuming an IWA${=}62$ mas ($3\lambda/D$). Improving the IWA${=}41$ mas ($2\lambda/D$) increases accessibility to rainbows and glints by factors of approximately 2 and 3, respectively. By observing these scattering features, HabWorlds could detect a surface ocean and water cycle, key indicators of habitability.

 - **Abstract**
 IceCube DeepCore, the existing low-energy extension of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, was designed to lower the neutrino detection energy threshold to the GeV range. A new extension, called the IceCube Upgrade, will consist of seven additional strings installed within the DeepCore fiducial volume. The new modules will have spacings of about 20 m horizontally and 3 m vertically, compared to about 40-70 m horizontally and 7 m vertically in DeepCore. It will be deployed in the polar season of 2025/26. This additional hardware features new types of optical modules with multi-PMT configurations, as well as calibration devices. This upgrade will more than triple the number of PMT channels with respect to current IceCube, and will significantly enhance its capabilities in the GeV energy range. However, the increased channel count also poses new computational challenges for the event simulation, selection, and reconstruction. In this contribution we present updated oscillation sensitivities based on the latest advancements in simulation, event selection, and reconstruction techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 Searches for neutrinos from gravitational wave events have been performed utilizing the wide energy range of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. We discuss results from these searches during the third observing run (O3) of the advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, including a low-latency follow-up of public candidate alert events in O3, an archival search on high-energy track data, and a low-energy search employing IceCube-DeepCore. The dataset of high-energy tracks is mainly sensitive to muon neutrinos, while the low energy dataset is sensitive to neutrinos of all flavors. In all of these searches, we present upper limits on the neutrino flux and isotropic equivalent energy emitted in neutrinos. We also discuss future plans for additional searches, including extending the low-latency follow-up to the next observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors (O4) and analysis of gravitational wave (GW) events using a high-energy cascade dataset, which are produced by electron neutrino charged-current interactions and neutral-current interactions from neutrinos of all flavors.
#### Rapid Formation of Gas-giant Planets via Collisional Coagulation from  Dust Grains to Planetary Cores. II. Dependence on Pebble Bulk Density and  Disk Temperature
 - **Authors:** Hiroshi Kobayashi, Hidekazu Tanaka

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15329
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15329
 - **Abstract**
 Thanks to ``dust-to-planet'' simulations (DTPSs), which treat the collisional evolution directly from dust to giant-planet cores in a protoplanetary disk, we showed that giant-planet cores are formed in $\lesssim 10\,$au in several $10^5$ years, because porous pebbles grow into planetesimals via collisions prior to drift in 10 au (Kobayashi & Tanaka 2021, Paper I).However, such porous pebbles are unlikely to reproduce the polarized millimeter wavelength light observed from protoplanetary disks. We thus investigate gas-giant core formation with non-porous pebbles via DTPSs. Even non-porous bodies can grow into planetesimals and massive cores to be gas giants are also formed in several $10^5$ years. The rapid core formation is mainly via the accretion of planetesimals produced by collisional coagulation of pebbles drifting from the outer disk. The formation mechanism is similar to the case with porous pebbles, while core formation occurs in a wider region (5 - 10 au) than that with porous pebbles.
#### IceCube search for neutrinos from novae

 - **Abstract**
 Despite being one of the longest known classes of astrophysical transients, novae continue to present modern surprises. The Fermi-LAT discovered that many if not all novae are GeV gamma ray sources, even though theoretical models had not even considered them as a possible source class. More recently, MAGIC and H.E.S.S. detected TeV gamma rays from a nova. Moreover, there is strong evidence that the gamma rays are produced hadronically, and that the long-studied optical emission by novae is also shock-powered. If this is true, novae should emit a neutrino signal correlated with their gamma-ray and optical signals. We present the first search for neutrinos from novae. Because the neutrino energy spectrum is expected to match the gamma-ray spectrum, we use an IceCube DeepCore event selection focused on GeV-TeV neutrinos. We present results from two searches, one for neutrinos correlated with gamma-ray emission and one for neutrinos correlated with optical emission. The event selection presented here is promising for additional astrophysical transients including gamma-ray bursts and gravitational wave sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Black Holes (BH) traversing a dark matter cloud made out of a self-interacting scalar soliton are slowed down by two complementary effects. At low subsonic speeds, the BH accretes dark matter and this is the only source of dragging along its motion, if we neglect the backreaction of the cloud self-gravity. The situation changes at larger supersonic speeds where a bow shock in front of the BH is created. This leads to the emergence of an additional friction term, associated with the gravitational and scalar pressure interactions and with the wake behind the moving BH. This is a long distance effect that can be captured by the hydrodynamical regime of the scalar flow far away from the BH. This dynamical friction term has the same form as the celebrated Chandrasekhar collisionless result, albeit with a well-defined Coulomb logarithm. Indeed the infra-red cut-off is naturally provided by the size of the scalar cloud, which is set by the scalar mass and coupling, whilst the ultra-violet behaviour corresponds to the distance from the BH where the velocity field is significantly perturbed by the BH. As a result, supersonic BH are slowed down by both the accretion drag and the dynamical friction. This effect will be potentially detectable by future gravitational wave experiments as it influences the phase of the gravitational wave signal from inspiralling binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the geographic South Pole is, with its surface and in-ice detectors, used for both neutrino and cosmic-ray physics. The surface array, named IceTop, consists of ice-Cherenkov tanks grouped in 81 pairs spanning a 1 km$^2$ area. An enhancement of the surface array, composed of elevated scintillation panels and radio antennas, was designed over the last years in order to increase the scientific capabilities of IceTop. The surface radio antennas, in particular, will be able to reconstruct $X_\mathrm{max}$, an observable widely used to determine the mass composition of cosmic rays. A complete prototype station of this enhanced array was deployed in the Austral summer of 2019/20 at the South Pole. This station comprises three antennas and eight scintillation panels, arranged in a three-arms star shape. The nominal frequency band of the radio antennas is 70 to 350 MHz. In this work, we use a state-of-the-art reconstruction method in which observed events are compared directly to CoREAS simulations to obtain an estimation of the air-shower variables, in particular, energy and $X_\mathrm{max}$. We will show the results in this unique frequency band using the three prototype antennas.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the new QUIJOTE-MFI wide survey (11, 13, 17 and 19 GHz) to produce spectral energy distributions (SEDs), on an angular scale of 1 deg, of the supernova remnants (SNRs) CTB 80, Cygnus Loop, HB 21, CTA 1, Tycho and HB 9. We provide new measurements of the polarized synchrotron radiation in the microwave range. For each SNR, the intensity and polarization SEDs are obtained and modelled by combining QUIJOTE-MFI maps with ancillary data. In intensity, we confirm the curved power law spectra of CTB 80 and HB 21 with a break frequency $\nu_{\rm b}$ at 2.0$^{+1.2}_{-0.5}$ GHz and 5.0$^{+1.2}_{-1.0}$ GHz respectively; and spectral indices respectively below and above the spectral break of $-0.34\pm0.04$ and $-0.86\pm0.5$ for CTB 80, and $-0.24\pm0.07$ and $-0.60\pm0.05$ for HB 21. In addition, we provide upper limits on the Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME), suggesting that the AME contribution is negligible towards these remnants. From a simultaneous intensity and polarization fit, we recover synchrotron spectral indices as flat as $-0.24$, and the whole sample has a mean and scatter of $-0.44\pm0.12$. The polarization fractions have a mean and scatter of $6.1\pm1.9$\%. When combining our results with the measurements from other QUIJOTE studies of SNRs, we find that radio spectral indices are flatter for mature SNRs, and particularly flatter for CTB 80 ($-0.24^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$) and HB 21 ($-0.34^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$). In addition, the evolution of the spectral indices against the SNRs age is modelled with a power-law function, providing an exponent $-0.07\pm0.03$ and amplitude $-0.49\pm0.02$ (normalised at 10 kyr), which are conservative with respect to previous studies of our Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud.
#### Classifying core collapse supernova remnants by their morphology as  shaped by the last exploding jets

 - **Abstract**
 Under the assumption that jets explode all core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) I classify 13 CCSN remnants (CCSNRs) into five groups according to their morphology as shaped by jets, and attribute the classes to the specific angular momentum of the pre-collapse core. Point-symmetry (1 CCSNR): According to the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) when the pre-collapse core rotates very slowly the newly born neutron star (NS) launches tens of jet-pairs in all directions. The last several jet-pairs might leave an imprint of several pairs of ears, i.e., a point-symmetric morphology. One pair of ears (7 CCSNRs): More rapidly rotating cores might force the last pair of jets to be long-lived and shape one pair of jet-inflated ears that dominate the morphology. S-shaped (1 CCSNR): The accretion disk might precess, leading to an S-shaped morphology. Barrel-shaped (3 CCSNRs): Even more rapidly rotating pre-collapse cores might result in a final energetic pair of jets that clear the region along the axis of the pre-collapse core rotation and form a barrel-shaped morphology. Elongated (1 CCSNR): Very rapidly rotating pre-collapse core force all jets to be along the same axis such that the jets are inefficient in expelling mass from the equatorial plane and the long-lasting accretion process turns the NS into a black hole (BH). The two new results of this study are the classification of CCSNRs into five classes based on jet-shaped morphological features, and the attribution of the morphological classes mainly to the pre-collapse core rotation in the frame of the JJEM.
#### Towards a reliable prediction of the infrared spectra of cosmic  fullerenes and their derivatives in the JWST era

 - **Abstract**
 Fullerenes, including C60, C70, and C60+, are widespread in space through their characteristic infrared vibrational features (C60+ also reveals its presence in the interstellar medium through its electronic transitions) and offer great insights into the carbon chemistry and stellar evolution. The potential existence of fullerene-related species in space has long been speculated and recently put forward by a set of laboratory experiments of C60+, C60H+, C60O+, C60OH+, C70H+, and [C60-Metal]+ complexes. The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provides a unique opportunity to search for these fullerene-related species in space. To facilitate JWST search, analysis, and interpretation, an accurate knowledge of their vibrational properties is essential. Here, we compile a VibFullerene database and conduct a systematic theoretical study on those species. We derive a set of range-specific scaling factors for vibrational frequencies, to account for the deficiency of density functional theory calculations in predicting the accurate frequencies. Scaling factors with low root-mean-square and median errors for the frequencies are obtained, and their performance is evaluated, from which the best-performing methods are recommended for calculating the infrared spectra of fullerene derivatives which balance the accuracy and computational cost. Finally, the recommended vibrational frequencies and intensities of fullerene derivatives are presented for future JWST detection.
