 - **Abstract**
 A Uranus orbiter would be well positioned to detect the planet's free oscillation modes, whose frequencies can resolve questions about Uranus's weakly constrained interior. We calculate the spectra that may manifest in resonances with ring orbits or in Doppler imaging of Uranus's visible surface, using a wide range of interior models that satisfy the present constraints. Recent work has shown that Uranus's fundamental (f) and internal gravity (g) modes have appropriate frequencies to resonate with Uranus's narrow rings. We show that even a single $\ell=2$ f or g mode detected in ring imaging or occultations can constrain Uranus's core extent and density. Fully fluid models typically have $\ell=2-7$ f mode frequencies slightly too high to resonate among the narrow rings. If Uranus has a solid core that f modes cannot penetrate, their frequencies are reduced, rendering them more likely to be observed. A single $\ell\gtrsim7$ f mode detection would constrain Uranus's unknown rotation period. Meanwhile, the different technique of Doppler imaging seismology requires specialized instrumentation but could deliver many detections, with best sensitivity to acoustic (p) modes at mHz frequencies. Deviations from uniform frequency spacing can be used to locate density interfaces in Uranus's interior, such as a sharp core boundary. Shallower nonadiabaticity and condensation layers complicate this approach, but higher-order frequency differences can be analyzed to disentangle deep and near-surface effects. The detection of normal modes by a Uranus orbiter would help to discern among the degenerate solutions permitted by conventional measurements of the planet's static gravity field.

 - **Abstract**
 The impact of neutrino flavor conversion on the supernova mechanism is yet to be fully understood. We present multi-energy and multi-angle solutions of the neutrino quantum kinetic equations in three flavors, taking into account neutrino advection and non-forward collisions with the background medium. Flavor evolution is explored within a spherically symmetric shell surrounding the region of neutrino decoupling in the interior of a core-collapse supernova, relying on the outputs of a spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova model with a mass of $18.6 M_\odot$. We select two representative post-bounce times: $t_{\rm pb} = 0.25$ s (no angular crossings are present and flavor conversion is triggered by slow collective effects) and $t_{\rm pb} = 1$ s (angular crossings trigger fast flavor instabilities). We find that flavor equipartition is achieved in the antineutrino sector between $\bar\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_x = (\bar\nu_\mu + \bar\nu_\tau)/2$ for both post-bounce times. In the neutrino sector, flavor equipartition between $\nu_e$ and $\nu_x$ seems more likely at later post-bounce times, where the neutrino emission properties among different flavors tend to approach each other, but it is not a generic feature. The exponential growth of the $\nu_\mu$--$\nu_\tau$ asymmetry due to three-flavor effects is responsible for differences between the quasi-steady configurations obtained in the three-flavor solution and in the two-flavor approximation. This has consequences on the neutrino heating rate, which is generally larger when all three flavors are taken into account and can increase up to $30\%$ with respect to the case where flavor conversion is neglected.

 - **Abstract**
 Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXT) are a sub-class of High Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXB) in which a compact object accretes part of the clumpy wind of the blue supergiant companion, triggering a series of brief, X-ray flares lasting a few kiloseconds. Currently, only about fifteen SFXTs are known. The EXTraS catalog provides the timing signatures of every source observed by the EPIC instrument on-board XMM-Newton. Among the most peculiar sources, in terms of variability, we selected 4XMM J181330.1-17511 (J1813). We analyzed all publicly available X-ray data pointed at the J1813 position to determine the source's duty cycle and to provide a comprehensive description of its timing and spectral behavior during its active phase. Additionally, we searched for the optical and infrared counterpart of the X-ray source in public databases and fitted its Spectral Energy Distribution (SED). The optical-to-MIR SED of J1813 is consistent with a highly-absorbed (A$_V\sim38$) B0 star at $\sim$10 kpc. During its X-ray active phase, the source is characterized by continuous $\sim$thousands seconds-long flares with peak luminosities (2-12 keV) ranging from $10^{34}$ to $4 \times 10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Its X-ray spectrum is consistent with a high-absorbed power-law model with N$_H \sim 1.8 \times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $\Gamma \sim 1.66$. No spectral variability was observed as a function of time or flux. J1813 is in a quiescent state $\sim$60\% of the time, with an upper-limit luminosity of $8 \times 10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (at 10 kpc), implying an observed long-term X-ray flux variability $>$500. The optical counterpart alone indicates J1813 is a HMXB. Its transient nature, duty cycle, the amplitude of observed X-ray variability, the shape and luminosity of the X-ray flares -- and the lack of known X-ray outbursts ($>10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$) -- strongly support the identification of J1813 as an SFXT.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical simulations of multidimensional astrophysical fluids present considerable challenges. However, the development of exascale computing has significantly enhanced computational capabilities, motivating the development of new codes that can take full advantage of these resources. In this article, we introduce HERACLES++, a new hydrodynamics code with high portability, optimized for exascale machines with different architectures and running efficiently both on CPUs and GPUs. The code is Eulerian and employs a Godunov finite-volume method to solve the hydrodynamics equations, which ensures accuracy in capturing shocks and discontinuities. It includes different Riemann solvers, equations of state, and gravity solvers. It works in Cartesian and spherical coordinates, either in 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D, and uses passive scalars to handle gases with several species. The code accepts a user-supplied heating or cooling term to treat a variety of astrophysical contexts. In addition to the usual series of benchmarking tests, we use HERACLES++ to simulate the propagation of a supernova shock in a red-supergiant star envelope, from minutes after core collapse until shock emergence. In 1-D, the results from HERACLES++ are in agreement with those of V1D for the same configuration. In 3-D, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability develops and modifies the 1-D picture by introducing density and composition fluctuations as well as turbulence. The focus on a wedge, rather than the full solid angle, and the ability of running HERACLES++ with a large number of GPUs allow for long-term simulations of 3-D supernova ejecta with a sub-degree resolution. Future development is to extend HERACLES++ to a radiation-hydrodynamics code.
#### MIRI-LRS spectrum of a cold exoplanet around a white dwarf: water, ammonia, and methane measurements

 - **Abstract**
 The study of the atmosphere of exoplanets orbiting white dwarfs is a largely unexplored field. With WD\,0806-661\,b, we present the first deep dive into the atmospheric physics and chemistry of a cold exoplanet around a white dwarf. We observed WD 0806-661 b using JWST's Mid-InfraRed Instrument Low-Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI-LRS), covering the wavelength range from 5 -- 12~$\mu \rm{m}$, and the Imager, providing us with 12.8, 15, 18 and 21\,$\mu$m photometric measurements. We carried the data reduction of those datasets, tackling second-order effects to ensure a reliable retrieval analysis. Using the \textsc{TauREx} retrieval code, we inferred the pressure-temperature structure, atmospheric chemistry, mass, and radius of the planet. The spectrum of WD 0806-661 b is shaped by molecular absorption of water, ammonia, and methane, consistent with a cold Jupiter atmosphere, allowing us to retrieve their abundances. From the mixing ratio of water, ammonia and methane we derive $\rm{C/O} = 0.34 \pm 0.06$, $\rm{C/N} = 14.4 ^{+2.5}_{-1.8}$ and $\rm{N/O} = 0.023 \pm 0.004$ and the ratio of detected metals as proxy for metallicity. We also derive upper limits for the abundance of CO and $\rm{CO_2}$ ($1.2\cdot10^{-6} \rm{\,and\,} 1.6\cdot10^{-7}$ respectively), which were not detected by our retrieval models. While our interpretation of WD\,0806-661\,b's atmosphere is mostly consistent with our theoretical understanding, some results -- such as the lack of evidence for water clouds, an apparent increase in the mixing ratio of ammonia at low pressure, or the retrieved mass at odds with the supposed age -- remain surprising and require follow-up observational and theoretical studies to be confirmed.

 - **Abstract**
 Oph-S1 is the most luminous and massive stellar member of the nearby Ophiuchus star-forming region. Previous Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations have shown it to be an intermediate-mass binary system ($\sim 5\,{\rm M}_\odot$) with an orbital period of about 21 months, but a paucity of radio detections of the secondary near periastron could potentially have affected the determination of its orbital parameters. Here, we present nine new VLBA observations of Oph-S1 focused on its periastron passage in early 2024. We detect the primary in all observations and the secondary at five epochs, including three within about a month of periastron passage. The updated orbit, determined by combining our new data with 35 previous observations, agrees well with previous calculations and yields masses of $4.115 \pm0.039 \,{\rm M}_\odot$ and $0.814\pm0.006 \,{\rm M}_\odot$ for the two stars in the system.

 - **Abstract**
 The Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope has provided an abundance of exoplanet spectra over the years. These spectra have enabled analysis studies using atmospheric retrievals to constrain the properties of these objects. However, follow-up observations from the James Webb Space Telescope have called into question some of the results from these older datasets, and highlighted the need to properly understand the degeneracies associated with retrievals of WFC3 spectra. In this study, we perform atmospheric retrievals of 38 transmission spectra from WFC3 and use model comparison to determine the complexity required to fit the data. We explore the effect of retrieving system parameters such as the stellar radius and planet's surface gravity, and thoroughly investigate the degeneracies between individual model parameters -- specifically the temperature, abundance of water, and cloud-top level. We focus on three case studies (HD 209458b, WASP-12b, and WASP-39b) in an attempt to diagnose some of the issues with these retrievals, in particular the low retrieved temperatures when compared to the equilibrium values. Our study advocates for the careful consideration of parameter degeneracies when interpreting retrieval results, as well as the importance of wider wavelength coverage to break these degeneracies, in agreement with previous studies. The combination of data from multiple instruments, as well as analysis from multiple data reductions and retrieval codes, will allow us to robustly characterise the atmosphere of these exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultralight Dark Matter (ULDM) offers an alternative to cold dark matter, characterized by wavelike behavior on galactic scales. This contribution summarizes our work~\cite{Blas:2024duy} on how solitonic cores induced by ULDM affect gravitational waves (GWs), enabling their detection through next-generation observatories like LISA, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. We show that continuous GWs from spinning neutron stars near the Galactic Center (GC) can probe solitons for \(m \lesssim 10^{-22}\, \mathrm{eV}\) and surpass current constraints on the ULDM couplings to the Standard Model for masses \(m \lesssim 10^{-20}\, \mathrm{eV}\). Additionally, GW modulation could reveal solitons in extragalactic systems, particularly in more massive halos, highlighting the broad potential of GW-based methods for uncovering ULDM properties.
#### On the progenitor of the type Ia supernova remnant 0509-67.5

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the iron and hydrogen similar elliptical morphologies of the type Ia supernova (SN Ia) remnant (SNR) 0509-67.5, I suggest that the ambient gas shaped the SN ejecta, that it is a remnant of an old planetary nebula, and that the explosion was more or less spherical. Adding that there is no observed stellar survivor in this SNR, I conclude that the SN Ia scenarios that best account for the explosion of this SN inside a planetary nebula (SNIP), are the lonely white dwarf scenarios, i.e., the core-degenerate (CD) and the double degenerate (DD) with merger to explosion delay (MED) time, i.e., the DD-MED scenario. Other scenarios encounter challenges, but I cannot completely rule them out. If true, the suggestion of SNR~0509-67.5 being a SNIP implies that the fraction of SNIPs might be higher than the previously estimated 50 percent of all normal SNe Ia. In the frame of the CD and the DD-MED scenarios, I attribute the observed double-shell structure in calcium to Rayleigh-Taylor instability during the explosion process: the caps of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability mushrooms form the outer shell. Instabilities during the explosion process might form clumps of some elements moving much faster than their mean velocity, possibly explaining fast-moving intermediate-mass elements.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts with unidentified extra-galactic origin. Some FRBs exhibit mild magneto-ionic environmental variations, possibly attributed to plasma turbulence or geometric configuration variation in a binary system. Here we report an abrupt magneto-ionic environment variation of FRB 20220529, a repeating FRB from a disk galaxy at redshift 0.1839. Initially, its Faraday rotation measure (RM) was $21 \pm 96~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$ over 17 months. In December 2023, it jumped to $1976.9~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$, exceeding twenty times of the standard deviation of the previous RM variation, and returned to the typical values within two weeks. Such a drastic RM variation suggests a dense magnetized clump moving across the line of sight, possibly due to coronal mass ejection associated with a stellar flare. It indicates that the FRB likely has a companion star that produced the stellar flare.
