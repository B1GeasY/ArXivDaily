 - **Abstract**
 Ice-coated dust grains provide the main reservoir of volatiles that play an important role in planet formation processes and may become incorporated into planetary atmospheres. However, due to observational challenges, the ice abundance distribution in protoplanetary disks is not well constrained. We present JWST/MIRI observations of the edge-on disk HH 48 NE carried out as part of the IRS program Ice Age. We detect CO$_2$, NH$_3$, H$_2$O and tentatively CH$_4$ and NH$_4^+$. Radiative transfer models suggest that ice absorption features are produced predominantly in the 50-100 au region of the disk. The CO$_2$ feature at 15 micron probes a region closer to the midplane (z/r = 0.1-0.15) than the corresponding feature at 4.3 micron (z/r = 0.2-0.6), but all observations trace regions significantly above the midplane reservoirs where we expect the bulk of the ice mass to be located. Ices must reach a high scale height (z/r ~ 0.6; corresponding to modeled dust extinction Av ~ 0.1), in order to be consistent with the observed vertical distribution of the peak ice optical depths. The weakness of the CO$_2$ feature at 15 micron relative to the 4.3 micron feature and the red emission wing of the 4.3 micron CO$_2$ feature are both consistent with ices being located at high elevation in the disk. The retrieved NH$_3$ abundance and the upper limit on the CH$_3$OH abundance relative to H$_2$O are significantly lower than those in the interstellar medium (ISM), but consistent with cometary observations. Full wavelength coverage is required to properly study the abundance distribution of ices in disks. To explain the presence of ices at high disk altitudes, we propose two possible scenarios: a disk wind that entrains sufficient amounts of dust, thus blocking part of the stellar UV radiation, or vertical mixing that cycles enough ices into the upper disk layers to balance ice photodesorption.

 - **Abstract**
 The eruption of Nova V2891 Cygni in 2019 offers a rare opportunity to explore the shock-induced processes in novae ejecta. The spectral evolution shows noticeable differences in the evolution of various oxygen emission lines such as O I 7773 Å, O I 8446 Å, O I 1.1286 $\mu$m, O I 1.3164 $\mu$m, etc. Here, we use spectral synthesis code CLOUDY to study the temporal evolution of these oxygen emission lines. Our photoionization model requires the introduction of a component with a very high density ($n ~ 10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$) and an enhanced oxygen abundance (O/H $\sim$ 28) to produce the O I 7773 Å emission line, suggesting a stratification of material with high oxygen abundance within the ejecta. An important outcome is the behaviour of the O I 1.3164 $\mu$m line, which could only be generated by invoking the collisional ionization models in CLOUDY. Our phenomenological analysis suggests that O I 1.3164 $\mu$m emission originates from a thin, dense shell characterized by a high density of about $10^{12.5} - 10^{12.8}$ cm$^{-3}$, which is most likely formed due to the strong internal collisions. If such is the case, the O I 1.3164 $\mu$m emission presents itself as a tracer of shock-induced dust formation in V2891 Cyg. The collisional ionization models have also been successful in creating the high-temperature conditions ($~ 7.07 - 7.49 \times 10^5$ K) required to reproduce the observed high ionization potential coronal lines, which coincide with the epoch of dust formation and evolution of the O I 1.3164 $\mu$m emission line.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical network governing interstellar sulfur has been the topic of unrelenting discussion for the past decades due to the conspicuous discrepancy between its expected and observed abundances in different interstellar environments. More recently, the astronomical detections of CH3CH2SH and CH2CS highlighted the importance of interstellar formation routes for sulfur-bearing organic molecules with two carbon atoms. In this work, we perform a laboratory investigation of the solid-state chemistry resulting from the interaction between C2H2 molecules and SH radicals -- both thought to be present in interstellar icy mantles -- at 10 K. Reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy and quadrupole mass spectrometry combined with temperature-programmed desorption experiments are employed as analytical techniques. We confirm that SH radicals can kick-start a sulfur reaction network under interstellar cloud conditions and identify at least six sulfurated products: CH3CH2SH, CH2CHSH, HSCH2CH2SH, H2S2, and tentatively CH3CHS and CH2CS. Complementarily, we utilize computational calculations to pinpoint the reaction routes that play a role in the chemical network behind our experimental results. The main sulfur-bearing organic molecule formed under our experimental conditions is CH3CH2SH and its formation yield increases with the ratios of H to other reactants. It serves as a sink to the sulfur budget within the network, being formed at the expense of the other unsaturated products. The astrophysical implications of the chemical network proposed here are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular clouds show complex structures reflecting their non-linear dynamics. Many studies, investigating the bridge between their morphology and physical properties, have shown the interest provided by non-Gaussian higher-order statistics to grasp physical information. Yet, as this bridge is usually characterized in the supervised world of simulations, transferring it onto observations can be hazardous, especially when the discrepancy between simulations and observations remains unknown. In this paper, we aim at identifying relevant summary statistics directly from the observation data. To do so, we develop a test that compares the informative power of two sets of summary statistics for a given dataset. Contrary to supervised approaches, this test does not require the knowledge of any data label or parameter, but focuses instead on comparing the degeneracy levels of these descriptors, relying on a notion of statistical compatibility. We apply this test to column density maps of 14 nearby molecular clouds observed by Herschel, and iteratively compare different sets of usual summary statistics. We show that a standard Gaussian description of these clouds is highly degenerate but can be substantially improved when being estimated on the logarithm of the maps. This illustrates that low-order statistics, properly used, remain a very powerful tool. We then further show that such descriptions still exhibit a small quantity of degeneracies, some of which are lifted by the higher order statistics provided by reduced wavelet scattering transforms. This property of observations quantitatively differs from state-of-the-art simulations of dense molecular cloud collapse and is not reproduced by logfBm models. Finally we show how the summary statistics identified can be cooperatively used to build a morphological distance, which is evaluated visually, and gives very satisfactory results.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars are always the focus of astronomical research and a significant part of them (10--20%) moves in space at a high (supersonic) velocity. This paper presents the results of a study of the $\alpha$ Crucis system, located at $\sim$114 pc distance from the Sun, with an observed bow shock around it. We used data and images from the Gaia and WISE space telescopes. The coordinates, distance, and proper motion of the $\alpha$ Crucis system were used to determine its space velocity. We managed to find a stellar cluster to which the $\alpha$ Crucis system belongs, that is, it has not been ejected from its parent cluster, but is moving in space together with other members of the cluster. The $\alpha$ Crucis system has a velocity of $\sim$1.3 km/s relative to the star cluster. The geometric parameters of the bow shock are compatible with other known bow shocks. The bow shock is unaligned, i.e., most likely interstellar medium large-scale motions are responsible for the resulting bow shock, which is further evidence that the $\alpha$ Crucis system is not runaway in nature.

 - **Abstract**
 The tearing mode instability is a key process for magnetic energy conversion in magnetohydrodynamics, once anti-parallel components are allowed to reconnect, leading to the formation of magnetic islands. It has been employed to explain phenomena at different scales in nature, from galactic nuclei, to solar flares and laboratory fusion devices. In this study, we investigate the dynamics of a current sheet in the presence of a transverse magnetic field component, in the framework of viscoresistive, incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), both analytically and by means of direct numerical simulations. Firstly, we obtain analytical solution for the time-varying one-dimensional profile of an initial Harris current sheet in the presence of a transverse field. We find that the introduction of a transverse magnetic field disrupts the system's equilibrium, leading to the natural development of a neutral layer with shear flows within the current sheet, one along the antiparallel magnetic component and another along the guide field direction. Secondly, through numerical analysis, we examine the dispersion relation of the incompressible MHD equations in the context of a modified equilibrium profile due to the transverse field. Our findings indicate a rapid suppression of unstable modes of tearing instability with the width of the neutral layer, confirming the analytical predictions. These results offer new insightful understanding on the interplay between transverse magnetic fields, shear flows, and tearing mode instabilities in current sheet environments.
#### Unraveling the birthplaces of NGC2070's massive stars, tracked with MUSE and revealed with JWST

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of massive O-type stars cannot be simply explained as a scaled-up version of the accretion mechanisms observed in lower-mass stars. Understanding these processes necessitates systematic studies of their early stages. Forming massive stars remain embedded in their dense nursery clouds, and IR instruments with high spatial resolution capabilities are needed to better observe them. Despite these challenges, MUSE optical observations of the massive cluster NGC 2070 successfully detected potential star-forming regions through spatially resolved electron density maps. To further explore these regions, the JWST utilized its NIRCam and MIRI instruments to penetrate optically obscured areas. This study examines two specific regions in the southeast part of the NGC 2070 MUSE density map, where tracks of highly dense point sources were identified. NIRCam, partially overlapped with MIRI, resolved these MUSE findings, revealing a procession of stellar point sources in the projected images. The detections are associated with elongated clouds, suggesting greater proper motions compared to the surrounding interstellar medium. These findings may indicate the presence of runaway candidates in the early stages of their evolution that are following common escape routes. This would support the notion that dynamical ejection is an efficient mechanism for the formation of massive runaway stars during early stages and likely plays a significant role in the origin of O-type field stars. However, additional data are required to confirm this scenario and rule out other ionizing feedback mechanisms, such as those observed in the formation of pillar-like structures around HII regions in the Milky Way. MUSE electron density mapping effectively captures the complexity of NGC 2070's interstellar medium and highlights targets for subsequent spectroscopic follow-ups.

 - **Abstract**
 Transmission spectroscopy has been a workhorse technique over the past two decades to constrain the physical and chemical properties of exoplanet atmospheres. One of its classical key assumptions is that the portion of the atmosphere it probes -- the terminator region -- is homogeneous. Several works in the past decade, however, have put this into question for highly irradiated, hot ($T_{eq}\gtrsim 1000$ K) gas giant exoplanets both empirically and via 3-dimensional modelling. While models predict clear differences between the evening (day-to-night) and morning (night-to-day) terminators, direct morning/evening transmission spectra in a wide wavelength range has not been reported for an exoplanet to date. Under the assumption of precise and accurate orbital parameters on WASP-39 b, here we report the detection of inhomogeneous terminators on the exoplanet WASP-39 b, which allows us to retrieve its morning and evening transmission spectra in the near-infrared ($2-5\ \mu$m) using JWST. We observe larger transit depths in the evening which are, on average, $405 \pm 88$ ppm larger than the morning ones, also having qualitatively larger features than the morning spectrum. The spectra are best explained by models in which the evening terminator is hotter than the morning terminator by $177^{+65}_{-57}$ K with both terminators having C/O ratios consistent with solar. General circulation models (GCMs) predict temperature differences broadly consistent with the above value and point towards a cloudy morning terminator and a clearer evening terminator.

 - **Abstract**
 The astrophysical gravitational wave background (AGWB) is a stochastic GW signal that is emitted by different populations of inspiralling binary systems containing compact objects. In the frequency range between 10^{-4} and 10^{-1} Hz it will be detected by future space-based gravitational wave detectors like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Recently, Staelens & Nelemans 2024 (SN24) concluded that the white dwarf (WD) contribution to the AGWB dominates over that of black holes (BHs). We aim to investigate the uncertainties of the WD AGWB that arise from the use of different stellar metallicities, different star formation rate density (SFRD) models, and different binary evolution models. We use the code developed by SN24 to determine the WD component of the AGWB. We use a metallicity dependent SFRD based on Chruslinska et al (2019,2020,2021) to construct five different SFRD models. We use four different population models that use different common-envelope treatment and six different metallicities for each model. For all possible combinations, the WD component of the AGWB is dominant over other populations of compact objects. The effects of metallicity and population model are smaller than the effect of a (metallicity dependent) SFRD model. We find a range of about a factor of 5 in the level of the WD AGWB around a mid value of Omega_WD = 4 10^{-12} at 1 mHz and a shape that depends weakly on the model. We find an uncertainty for the WD component of the AGWB of about a factor 5. We note that there exist other uncertainties that have an effect on this signal as well. We discuss whether the turnover of the WD AGWB at 10 mHz will be detectable by LISA, and find that this is likely. We confirm the previous finding that the WD component of the AGWB dominates over other populations, in particular BHs.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova remnants (SNRs) are believed to be capable of accelerating cosmic rays (CRs) to PeV energies. SNR G106.3+2.7 is a prime PeVatron candidate. It is formed by a head region, where the pulsar J2229+6114 and its boomerang-shaped pulsar wind nebula are located, and a tail region containing SN ejecta. The lack of observed gamma ray emission from the two regions of this SNR has made it difficult to assess which region would be responsible for the PeV CRs. We aim to characterize the very-high-energy (VHE, 0.1-100 TeV) gamma ray emission from SNR G106.3+2.7 by determining the morphology and spectral energy distribution of the region. This is accomplished using 2565 days of data and improved reconstruction algorithms from the HAWC Observatory. We also explore possible gamma ray production mechanisms for different energy ranges. Using a multi-source fitting procedure based on a maximum-likelihood estimation method, we evaluate the complex nature of this region. We determine the morphology, spectrum, and energy range for the source found in the region. Molecular cloud information is also used to create a template and evaluate the HAWC gamma ray spectral properties at ultra-high-energies (UHE, >56 TeV). This will help probe the hadronic nature of the highest-energy emission from the region. We resolve one extended source coincident with all other gamma ray observations of the region. The emission reaches above 100~TeV and its preferred log-parabola shape in the spectrum shows a flux peak in the TeV range. The molecular cloud template fit on the higher energy data reveals that the SNR's energy budget is fully capable of producing a purely hadronic source for UHE gamma rays.

 - **Abstract**
 The line of sight toward Sk 143 (AzV 456), an O9.5 Ib star in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), shows significant absorption from neutral atoms and molecules. We report a new study of this line of sight by means of high-resolution spectra obtained with the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the VLT of ESO. The absorption from neutral and ionized species is well characterized by a single component at vhel about +132 km/s that was modeled with the ASTROCOOK code. The rubidium Rb I 780.0 nm line is detected for the first time outside the Galaxy, and we derive [Rb/H]= -1.86 +/- 0.09. As a result of the high resolution, the 85Rb and 87Rb isotope lines are also exceptionally well resolved. The 85Rb/87Rb isotope ratio is 0.46, which is opposite of the meteoritic value of 2.43. This implies that Rb is made through a dominant contribution of the r-process, which is dominant for the 87Rb isotope. We also confirm the presence of 7LiI 670.7 nm and set a limit on the isotopic ratio of 6Li/7Li < 0.1.The dominance of the 87Rb isotope implies that Rb is made through a dominant contribution of the r-process. At the low metallicity of the cloud of [Zn/H] = -1.28 +/- 0.09 , neutron rich material may have occurred in rotating metal-poor massive stars. Moreover, the low metallicity of the cloud leads to an absolute Li abundance of A(7Li) about 2.2, which differs from the expectation from big bang nucleosynthesis. Because the gas-phase abundance is not affected by stellar depletion, the burning of Li inside the halo stars is probably not the solution for the cosmological 7Li problem.

 - **Abstract**
 Our primary long-term objective is to seek out additional star clusters in the poorly studied regions of the MW. The aim of this pursuit is to finalize the MG's globular and open cluster system census and to gain a comprehensive understanding of both the formation and evolution of these systems and our Galaxy as a whole. We report the discovery of a new star cluster, named Garro~03. We investigated this target using a combination of near-infrared and optical databases. We employed VVVX and 2MASS data in the NIR, and Gaia DR3 and the DECaPS2 datasets in the optical passband. We performed a photometrical analysis in order to derive its main physical parameters. Garro~03 is located at equatorial coordinates RA=14:01:29.3 and Dec=-65:30:57.0. It is not heavily affected by extinction $A_{Ks}=0.25\pm 0.04$ mag. It is located at heliocentric distance of $14.1\pm0.5$ kpc, which places Garro~03 at 10.6 kpc from the Galactic centre and Z=-0.89 kpc below the Galactic plane. We calculated the mean cluster PM of ($\mu_{\alpha}^{\ast},\mu_{\delta}) = (-4.57\pm 0.29,\ -1.36\pm 0.27$) mas yr$^{-1}$. We derived an age=3 Gyr and [Fe/H]~$= -0.5\pm 0.2$ by the isochrone-fitting method. The total luminosity was derived in the $K_s$ and V-bands, finding $M_{Ks} = -6.32\pm 1.10$ mag and $M_V =-4.06$ mag. The core and tidal radii were measured constructing the Garro~03 radial density profile and fitting the King model, obtaining $r_c = 3.07\pm 0.98$ pc and $r_t = 19.36\pm 15.96$ pc. We photometrically confirm the cluster nature for Garro~03, located in the Galactic disk. It is a distant, low-luminosity, metal-rich star cluster of intermediate age. We also searched for possible signatures (streams or bridges) between Garro~03 and Garro~01, but we exclude a possible companionship. We need spectroscopic data to classify it as an old open cluster or a young globular cluster, and to understand its origin.
#### Revealing Gas Inflows towards the Galactic Central Molecular Zone

 - **Abstract**
 We study the gas inflows towards the Galactic Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) based on the gas morphological and kinematic features from the MWISP in the region of l=1.2 deg--19.0 deg and |b|<3.0 deg. We find that the near dust lane extends to l~15 deg, in which the end of the large-scale gas structure intersects with the 3 kpc-ring at a distance of ~5 kpc. Intriguingly, many filamentary MCs, together with the bow-like/ballistic-like clouds and continuous CO features with notable velocity gradient, are finely outlined along the long structure. These MCs also have relatively large velocity dispersions, indicating the shocked gas generated by local continuous accretion and thus the enhanced turbulence along the entire gas structure. We suggest that the ~3.1--3.6 kpc long CO structure originates from the accretion molecular gas driven by the Galactic bar. The gas near the bar end at the 3 kpc-ring becomes an important reservoir for the large-scale accreting flows inwards to the CMZ through the bar channel. The inclination angle of the bar is estimated to be 20--26 deg, while the pattern speed of the bar is 30--35 km/s. The total mass of the whole gas lane is about (0.9-1.7)x10^7 Msun according to the calculated X_CO=(0.6-1.4)x10^20 cm^-2 (Kkm/s)^-1 from the large-scale CO data and the complementary HI data. The mean gas inflow rate is about 0.8-1.4 Msun/yr, which seems to be comparable to the outflow's rate of the Galactic nuclear winds after applying the updated lower X-factor value above.
