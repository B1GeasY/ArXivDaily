 - **Abstract**
 We present the new Guided Moments ($\texttt{GM}$) formalism for neutrino modeling in astrophysical scenarios like core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. The truncated moments approximation ($\texttt{M1}$) and Monte-Carlo ($\texttt{MC}$) schemes have been proven to be robust and accurate in solving the Boltzmann's equation for neutrino transport. However, it is well-known that each method exhibits specific strengths and weaknesses in various physical scenarios. The $\texttt{GM}$ formalism effectively solves these problems, providing a comprehensive scheme capable of accurately capturing the optically thick limit through the exact $\texttt{M1}$ closure and the optically thin limit through a $\texttt{MC}$ based approach. In addition, the $\texttt{GM}$ method also approximates the neutrino distribution function with a reasonable computational cost, which is crucial for the correct estimation of the different neutrino-fluid interactions. Our work provides a comprehensive discussion of the formulation and application of the $\texttt{GM}$ method, concluding with a thorough comparison across several test problems involving the three schemes ($\texttt{M1}$, $\texttt{MC}$, $\texttt{GM}$) under consideration.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we constrain the star-forming properties of all possible sites of incipient high-mass star formation in the Milky Way's Galactic Center. We identify dense structures using the CMZoom 1.3mm dust continuum catalog of objects with typical radii of $\sim$0.1pc, and measure their association with tracers of high-mass star formation. We incorporate compact emission at 8, 21, 24, 25, and 70um from MSX, Spitzer, Herschel, and SOFIA, catalogued young stellar objects, and water and methanol masers to characterize each source. We find an incipient star formation rate (SFR) for the CMZ of ~0.08 Msun yr^{-1} over the next few 10^5 yr. We calculate upper and lower limits on the CMZ's incipient SFR of ~0.45 Msun yr^{-1} and ~0.05 Msun yr^{-1} respectively, spanning between roughly equal to and several times greater than other estimates of CMZ's recent SFR. Despite substantial uncertainties, our results suggest the incipient SFR in the CMZ may be higher than previously estimated. We find that the prevalence of star formation tracers does not correlate with source volume density, but instead ~75% of high-mass star formation is found in regions above a column density ratio (N_{SMA}/N_{Herschel}) of ~1.5. Finally, we highlight the detection of ``atoll sources'', a reoccurring morphology of cold dust encircling evolved infrared sources, possibly representing HII regions in the process of destroying their envelopes.
#### On the Late-Time Evolution of Velocity-Dependent Self-Interacting Dark  Matter Halos
 - **Authors:** Sophia Gad-Nasr, Kimberly Boddy, Manoj Kaplinghat, Nadav Joseph Outmezguine, Laura Sagunski
 - **Subjects:** Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.09296
 - **Abstract**
 We study the evolution of isolated self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos that undergo gravothermal collapse and are driven deep into the short-mean-free-path regime. We assume spherical Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halos as initial conditions and allow for elastic dark matter self-interactions. We discuss the structure of the halo core deep in the core-collapsed regime and how it depends on the particle physics properties of dark matter, in particular, the velocity dependence of the self-interaction cross section. We find an approximate universality deep in this regime that allows us to connect the evolution in the short- and long-mean-free-path regimes, and approximately map the velocity-dependent self-interaction cross sections to constant ones for the full gravothermal evolution. We provide a semi-analytic prescription based on our numerical results for halo evolution deep in the core-collapsed regime. Our results are essential for estimating the masses of the black holes that are likely to be left in the core of SIDM halos.

 - **Abstract**
 The structure of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) outside of its main body is characterised by tidal branches resulting from its interactions mainly with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Characterising the stellar populations in these tidal components helps to understand the dynamical history of this galaxy and of the Magellanic system in general. We provide full phase-space vector information for Southern Bridge clusters. We performed a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of twelve SMC clusters, doubling the number of SMC clusters with full phase-space vector information known to date. We reclassify the sample considering 3D distances and 3D velocities. We found that some of the clusters classified as Southern Bridge objects according to the projected 2D classification actually belong to the Main Body and Counter-Bridge in the background. The comparison of the kinematics of the genuine foreground Bridge clusters with those previously analysed in the same way reveals that Southern Bridge clusters are moving towards the LMC and share the kinematics of the Northern Bridge. Adding to our sample clusters from the literature with CaT metallicity determinations we compare the age-metallicity relation of the Southern Bridge with the one of the Northern Bridge. We reinforce the idea that both regions do not seem to have experienced the same chemical enrichment history and that there is a clear absence of clusters in the Northern Bridge older than 3Gyr and more metal-poor than -1.1, which would not seem to be due to a selection effect.
#### The mass range of hot subdwarf B stars from MESA simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Hot subdwarf B (sdB) stars are helium core burning stars that have lost almost their entire hydrogen envelope due to binary interaction. Their assumed canonical mass of $\rm M_{\mathrm{sdB}}\sim0.47 M_{\odot}$ has recently been debated given a broad range found both from observations as well as from the simulations. Here, we revise and refine the mass range for sdBs derived two decades ago with the Eggleton code, using the stellar evolution code MESA, and discuss the effects of metallicity and the inclusion of core overshooting during the main sequence. We find an excellent agreement for low-mass progenitors, up to $\sim2.0 \rm M_{\odot}$. For stars more massive than $\sim2.5 \rm M_{\odot}$ we obtain a wider range of sdB masses compared to the simulations from the literature. Our MESA models for the lower metallicity predict, on average, slightly more massive sdBs. Finally, we show the results for the sdB lifetime as a function of sdB mass and discuss the effect this might have in the comparison between simulations and observational samples. This study paves the way for reproducing the observed Galactic mass distribution of sdB binaries.
