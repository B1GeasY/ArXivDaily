 - **Abstract**
 Observations of cooler atmospheres of super-Earths and Neptune sized objects often show flat transmission spectra. The most likely cause of this trend is the presence of aerosols (i.e. clouds and hazes) in the atmospheres of such objects. High-resolution spectroscopy provides an opportunity to test this hypothesis by targeting molecular species whose spectral line cores extend above the level of such opaque decks. In this work, we analyse high-resolution infrared observations of the warm Neptune GJ 3470 b taken over two transits using CARMENES (R $\sim$ 80,000) and look for signatures of H$_2$O (previously detected using HST WFC3+Spitzer observations) in these transits with a custom pipeline fully accounting for the effects of data cleaning on any potential exoplanet signal. We find that our data are potentially able to weakly detect ($\sim3\sigma$) an injected signal equivalent to the best-fit model from previous HST WFC3+Spitzer observations. However, we do not make a significant detection using the actual observations. Using a Bayesian framework to simultaneously constrain the H$_2$O Volume Mixing Ratio (VMR) and the cloud top pressure level, we select a family of models compatible with the non detection. These are either very high VMR, cloud-free models, solar-abundance models with a high cloud deck, or sub-solar abundance models with a moderate cloud deck. This is a broader range compared to published results from low-resolution spectroscopy, but is also compatible with them at a 1$\sigma$ level.
#### A Multi-wavelength Study on A Gamma-ray Bright AGN 1308+326 Using KVN at  22 and 43 GHz

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we conduct a multi-frequency analysis of the gamma-ray bright blazar 1308+326 from February 2013 to March 2020, using the Korean VLBI Network at 22 and 43 GHz and gamma-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Our findings reveal spectral variations around the 2014 gamma-ray flare, aligning with the shock-in-jet model. A strong correlation is observed between gamma-ray and 43 GHz emissions, with a 27-day lag in the VLBI core light curve, indicating a 50-day delay from the beginning of a specific radio flare to the gamma-ray peak. This radio flare correlates with a new jet component, suggesting the 2014 gamma-ray flare resulted from its interaction with a stationary component. Our analysis indicates the 2014 gamma-ray flare originated 40-63 parsecs from the central engine, with seed photons for the gamma-ray emission unlikely from the broad-line region.

 - **Abstract**
 We recently introduced three new parameters that describe the shape of the normalized cumulative radial distribution (nCRD) of the innermost stars in globular clusters and trace the clusters dynamical evolution. Here we extend our previous investigations to the case of a large set of Monte Carlo simulations of globular clusters, started from a broad range of initial conditions. All the models are analyzed at the same age of 13 Gyr, when they have reached different evolutionary phases. The sample of models is well representative of the structural properties of the observed population of Galactic globular clusters. We confirm that the three nCRD parameters are powerful tools to distinguish systems in early stages of dynamical evolution, from those that already experienced core collapse. They might also help disentangle clusters hosting a low-mass intermediate-mass black hole of a few hundred solar masses, from cases with large concentrations of dark remnants in their centers. With respect to other dynamical indicators, the nCRD parameters offer the advantage of being fully empirical and easier to measure from observational data.
#### Relative Occurrence Rate Between Hot and Cold Jupiters as an Indicator  to Probe Planet Migration

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a second-order statistic parameter $\varepsilon$, the relative occurrence rate between hot and cold Jupiters ($\varepsilon=\eta_{\rm HJ}/\eta_{\rm CJ}$), to probe the migration of gas giants. Since the planet occurrence rate is the combined outcome of the formation and migration processes, a joint analysis of hot and cold Jupiter frequency may shed light on the dynamical evolution of giant planet systems. We first investigate the behavior of $\varepsilon$ as the stellar mass changes observationally. Based on the occurrence rate measurements of hot Jupiters ($\eta_{\rm HJ}$) from the TESS survey and cold Jupiters ($\eta_{\rm CJ}$) from the CLS survey, we find a tentative trend (97% confidence) that $\varepsilon$ drops when the stellar mass rises from $0.8$ to $1.4\ M_\odot$, which can be explained by different giant planet growth and disk migration timescales around different stars. We carry out planetesimal and pebble accretion simulations, both of which could reproduce the results of $\eta_{\rm HJ}$, $\eta_{\rm CJ}$ and $\varepsilon$. Our findings indicate that the classical core accretion + disk migration model can explain the observed decreasing trend of $\varepsilon$. We propose two ways to increase the significance of the trend and verify the anti-correlation. Future works are required to better constrain $\varepsilon$, especially for M dwarfs and for more massive stars.
#### An efficient tidal dissipation mechanism via stellar magnetic fields

 - **Abstract**
 Recent work suggests that inwardly propagating internal gravity waves (IGWs) within a star can be fully converted to outward magnetic waves (MWs) if they encounter a sufficiently strong magnetic field. The resulting magnetic waves dissipate as they propagate outward to regions with lower Alfv\'{e}n velocity. While tidal forcing is known to excite IGWs, this conversion and subsequent damping of magnetic waves has not been explored as a tidal dissipation mechanism. In particular, stars with sufficiently strong magnetic fields could fully dissipate tidally excited waves, yielding the same tidal evolution as the previously-studied ``travelling wave regime''. Here, we evaluate the viability of this mechanism using stellar models of stars with convective cores (F-type stars in the mass range of $1.2$-$1.6M_\odot$) which were previously thought to be weakly tidally dissipative (due to the absence of nonlinear gravity wave breaking). The criterion for wave conversion to operate is evaluated for each stellar mass using the properties of each star's interior along with estimates of the magnetic field produced by a convective core dynamo under the assumption of equipartition between kinetic (convective) and magnetic energies. Our main result is that this previously unexplored source of efficient tidal dissipation can operate in stars within this mass range for significant fractions of their lifetimes. This tidal dissipation mechanism appears to be consistent with the observed inspiral of WASP-12b, and more generally could play an important role in the orbital evolution of hot Jupiters -- and to lower mass ultra-short period planets -- orbiting F-type stars.

 Observations point to old white dwarfs (WDs) accreting metals at a relatively constant rate over 8~Gyrs. Exo-Oort clouds around WDs have been proposed as potential reservoirs of materials, with galactic tide as a mechanism to deliver distant comets to the WD's Roche limit. In this work, we characterise the dynamics of comets around a WD with a companion having semi-major axes on the orders of 10 - 100 AU. We develop simulation techniques capable of integrating a large number ($10^8$) of objects over a 1 Gyr timescale. Our simulations include galactic tide and are capable of resolving close-interactions with a massive companion. Through simulations, we study the accretion rate of exo-Oort cloud comets into a WD's Roche limit. We also characterise the dynamics of precession and scattering induced on a comet by a massive companion. We find that (i) WD pollution by an exo-Oort cloud can be sustained over a Gyr timescale, (ii) an exo-Oort cloud with structure like our own Solar System's is capable of delivering materials into an isolated WD with pollution rate $\sim 10^8 \mathrm{~g~s^{-1}}$, (iii) adding a planetary-mass companion reduces the pollution rate to $\sim 10^7 \mathrm{~g~s^{-1}}$, and (iv) if the companion is stellar-mass, with $M_p \gtrsim 0.1 M_\odot$, the pollution rate reduces to $\sim 3 \times 10^5 \mathrm{~g~s^{-1}}$ due to a combination of precession induced on a comet by the companion, a strong scattering barrier, and low-likelihood of direct collisions of comets with the companion.
