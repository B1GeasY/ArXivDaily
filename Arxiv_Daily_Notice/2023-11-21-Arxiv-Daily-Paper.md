#### Density profile of a self-gravitating polytropic turbulent fluid in a  rotating disk near to the cloud core

 - **Abstract**
 We obtain two equations (following from two different approaches) for the density profile in a self-gravitating polytropic cylindrically symmetric and rotating turbulent gas disk. The adopted physical picture is appropriate to describe the conditions near to the cloud core where the equation of state of the gas changes from isothermal (in the outer cloud layers) to one of "hard polytrope", and the symmetry changes from spherical to cylindrical. On the assumption of steady state, as the accreting matter passes through all spatial scales, we show that the total energy per unit mass is an invariant with respect to the fluid flow. The obtained equation describes the balance of the kinetic, thermal and gravitational energy of a fluid element. We also introduce a method for approximating density profile solutions (in a power-law form), leading to the emergence of three different regimes. We apply, as well, dynamical analysis of the motion of a fluid element. Only one of the regimes is in accordance with the two approaches (energy and force balance). It corresponds to a density profile of a slope -2, polytropic exponent 3/2, and sub-Keplerian rotation of the disk, when the gravity is balanced by the thermal pressure. It also matches with some observations and numerical works and, in particular, leads to a second power-law tail (of a slope approx. -1) of the density distribution function in dense, self-gravitating cloud regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Nanometre- to micrometre-sized solid dust particles play a vital role in star and planet formations. Despite of their importance, however, our understanding of physical and chemical properties of dust particles is still provisional. We have conducted a condensation experiment of the vapour generated from a solid starting material having nearly cosmic proportions in elements. A laser flash heating and subsequent cooling has produced a diverse type of nanoparticles simultaneously. Here we introduce four types of nanoparticles as potential dust particles in space: amorphous silicate nanoparticles (type S); core/mantle nanoparticles with iron or hydrogenised-iron core and amorphous silicate mantle (type IS); silicon oxycarbide nanoparticles and hydrogenised silicon oxycarbide nanoparticles (type SiOC); and carbon nanoparticles (type C), all produced in a single heating-cooling event. Type IS and SiOC nanoparticles are new for potential astrophysical dust. The nanoparticles are aggregated to a wide variety of structures, from compact, fluffy, and networked. A simultaneous formation of nanoparticles, which are diverse in chemistry, shape, and structure, prompts a re-evaluation of astrophysical dust particles
#### Collisional and Fast Neutrino Flavor Instabilities in Two-dimensional  Core-collapse Supernova Simulation with Boltzmann Neutrino Transport
 - **Authors:** Ryuichiro Akaho, Jiabao Liu, Hiroki Nagakura, Masamichi Zaizen, Shoichi Yamada
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11272

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study on the occurrences of the collisional flavor instability (CFI) and the fast flavor instability (FFI) of neutrinos based on a two-dimensional (2D) core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulation performed with a Boltzmann radiation hydrodynamics code. We find that CFI occurs in a region with the baryon-mass density of $10^{10}\lesssim \rho \lesssim 10^{12}\,\mathrm{g}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, which is similar to the previous results in one-dimensional (1D) CCSN models. In contrast to 1D, however, the CFI region varies with time vigorously in the 2D model, whereas it had a quiescent structure in 1D. This is attributed to the fact that the turbulent flows advected from a gain region account for the temporal variations. Another noticeable difference from the 1D models is the appearance of resonance-like CFI where number densities of $\nu_e$, $\bar\nu_e$ nearly coincide each other. The CFI growth rate there is enhanced and can reach $\sim10^{-3}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. As for FFI, on the other hand, it appears in three different regions; (1) the region overlapped with the resonance-like CFI, (2) neutrino decoupling regions where $\bar{\nu}_e$'s are strongly emitted, and (3) optically thin regions where neutral-current scatterings dominate over charged-current reactions. Although overall properties for FFI are consistent with previous studies, we find that the number of electron-neutrinos lepton number crossing (ELN crossing) temporary becomes multiple, which can be assessed accurately only by multi-angle treatments in neutrino transport. We find that the growth rate of FFI is always higher than CFI if both of them occur, which suggests that the former is dominant for the linear evolution.
#### G213.0$-$0.6, a true supernova remnant or just an HII region?
 - **Authors:** X. Y. Gao, C. J. Wu, X. H. Sun, W. Reich, J. L. Han

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11277
 - **Abstract**
 G213.0$-$0.6 is a faint extended source situated in the anti-center region of the Galactic plane. It has been classified as a shell-type supernova remnant (SNR) based on its shell-like morphology, steep radio continuum spectrum, and high ratio of [S II]/H$\alpha$. With new optical emission line data of H$\alpha$, [S II], and [N II] recently observed by the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, the ratios of [S II]/H$\alpha$ and [N II]/H$\alpha$ are re-assessed. The lower values than those previously reported put G213.0$-$0.6 around the borderline of SNR-HII region classification. We decompose the steep-spectrum synchrotron and the flat-spectrum thermal free-free emission in the area of G213.0$-$0.6 with multi-frequency radio continuum data. G213.0$-$0.6 is found to show a flat spectrum, in conflict with the properties of a shell-type SNR. Such a result is further confirmed by TT-plots made between the 863-MHz, 1.4-GHz, and 4.8-GHz data. Combining the evidence extracted in both optical and radio continuum, we argue that G213.0$-$0.6 is possibly not an SNR, but an HII region instead. The $V_{LSR}$ pertaining to the H$\alpha$ filaments places G213.0$-$0.6 approximately 1.9 kpc away in the Perseus Arm.

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsars can serve as effective probes to investigate the presence of Intermediate-mass Black Holes (IMBHs) within Galactic globular clusters (GCs). Based on the standard structure models for GCs, we conduct simulations to analyze the distributions of pulsar accelerations within the central region of NGC 6517. By comparing the measured accelerations of pulsars obtained from their period derivatives $\dot P$ to the simulated distribution profiles, we demonstrate that a central excess of dark mass is required to account for the measured accelerations. Our analysis, which relies on existing pulsar timing observations, is currently unable to differentiate between two possible scenarios: an IMBH precisely situated at the core of the cluster with mass $\gtrsim 9000^{+4000}_{-3000}~M_{\odot}$, or a central concentration of stellar mass dark remnants with a comparable total mass. However, with additional acceleration measurements from a few more pulsars in the cluster, it will be possible to differentiate the source of the nonluminous matter.

 - **Abstract**
 For several decades we have been performing photometric monitoring of some of the star formation regions. Significant place in our program take observations of objects of the type FU Orionis, EX Lupi, UX Orionis and other similar but unclassified objects. These three types of young variable objects show changes in brightness with large amplitudes and attract the attention of star formation researchers. But it is not always possible to distinguish them from each other without the presence of long-term multicolor photometric data. For this reason, we collect data from current CCD observations and supplement them with data from the photographic plates archives. In this paper, we show the latest data from optical photometric studies of four PMS objects (V2493 Cyg, V582 Aur, V733 Cep and V1180 Tau) made at the Rozhen Observatory. Our monitoring is carried out in $BVRI$ filters, which allows studying the variability in color indexes also. By analysis the historical light curves of these objects we are trying to obtain information about the processes associated with the early stages of stellar evolution.
#### Thermodynamics of fluid elements in the context of saturated isothermal  turbulence in molecular clouds

 - **Abstract**
 The presented paper is an attempt to investigate the dynamical states of an hydrodynamical isothermal turbulent self-gravitating system using some powerful tools of the classical thermodynamics. Our main assumption, inspired by the work of Keto et al. (2020), is that turbulent kinetic energy can be substituted for the macro-temperature of chaotic motion of fluid elements. As a proper sample for our system we use a model of turbulent self-gravitating isothermal molecular cloud which is at final stages of its life-cycle, when the dynamics is nearly in steady state. Starting from this point, we write down the internal energy for a physically small cloud's volume, and then using the first principle of thermodynamics obtain in explicit form the entropy, free energy, and Gibbs potential for this volume. Setting fiducial boundary conditions for the latter system (small volume) we explore its stability as a grand canonical ensemble. Searching for extrema of the Gibbs potential we obtain conditions for its minimum, which corresponds to a stable dynamical state of hydrodynamical system. This result demonstrates the ability of our novel approach.

 - **Abstract**
 Methods: Broad- and narrow-band imaging of AFGL 5180 was made in the NIR with the LBT, in both seeing-limited ($\sim0.5\arcsec$) and high angular resolution ($\sim0.09\arcsec$) Adaptive Optics (AO) modes, as well as with HST. Archival ALMA continuum data was also utilized. Results: At least 40 jet knots were identified via NIR emission from H$_2$ and [FeII] tracing shocked gas. Bright jet knots outflowing from the central most massive protostar, S4, are detected towards the east of the source and are resolved in fine detail with the AO imaging. Additional knots are distributed throughout the field, likely indicating the presence of multiple driving sources. Sub-millimeter sources detected by ALMA are shown to be grouped in two main complexes, AFGL 5180 M and a small cluster $\sim15\arcsec$ to the south, AFGL 5180 S. From our NIR continuum images we identify YSO candidates down to masses of $\sim 0.1\:M_\odot$. Combined with the sub-mm sources, this yields a surface number density of such YSOs of $N_* \sim 10^3 {\rm pc}^{-2}$ within a projected radius of about 0.1 pc. Such a value is similar to those predicted by models of both Core Accretion from a turbulent clump environment and Competitive Accretion. The radial profile of $N_*$ is relatively flat on scales out to 0.2~pc, with only modest enhancement around the massive protostar inside 0.05~pc. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the utility of high-resolution NIR imaging, in particular with AO, for detecting outflow activity and YSOs in distant regions. The presented images reveal the complex morphology of outflow-shocked gas within the large-scale bipolar flow of a massive protostar, as well as clear evidence for several other outflow driving sources in the region. Finally, this work presents a novel approach to compare the observed YSO surface number density from our study against different models of massive star formation.
