 - **Abstract**
 Networks of ground stations designed to transmit and receive at optical wavelengths through the atmosphere offer an opportunity to provide on-demand, high-bandwidth, secure communications with spacecraft in Earth orbit and beyond. This work describes the operation and activities of current Free Space Optical Communication (FSOC) ground stations in Germany and Australasia. In Germany, FSOC facilities are located at the Oberpfaffenhofen campus of the Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft- und Raumfahrt (German Aerospace Center, DLR), the Laser-Bodenstation in Trauen (Responsive Space Cluster Competence Center, DLR), and the Research Center Space of the University of the Bundeswehr Munich in Neubiberg. The DLR also operates a ground station in Almeria, Spain as part of the European Optical Nucleus Network. The Australasian Optical Ground Station Network (AOGSN) is a proposed network of 0.5 -- 0.7m class optical telescopes located across Australia and New Zealand. The development and progress for each node of the AOGSN is reported, along with optimisation of future site locations based on cloud cover analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 We present time-series linear-polarization observations of the bright O4 supergiant $\zeta$ Puppis. The star is found to show polarization variation on timescales of around an hour and longer. Many of the observations were obtained contemporaneously with Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry. We find that the polarization varies on similar timescales to those seen in the TESS light-curve. The previously reported 1.78-day photometric periodicity is seen in both the TESS and polarization data. The amplitude ratio of photometry to polarization is ~9 for the periodic component and the polarization variation is oriented along position angle ~70 deg-160 deg. Higher-frequency stochastic variability is also seen in both datasets with an amplitude ratio of ~19 and no preferred direction. We model the polarization expected for a rotating star with bright photospheric spots and find that models that fit the photometric variation produce too little polarization variation to explain the observations. We suggest that the variable polarization is more likely the result of scattering from the wind, with corotating interaction regions producing the periodic variation and a clumpy outflow producing the stochastic component. The H$\alpha$ emission line strength was seen to increase by 10% in 2021 with subsequent observations showing a return to the pre-2018 level.

 - **Abstract**
 In order to understand the relationship between planet multiplicity, mass, and composition, we present newly measured masses of five planets in two planetary systems: Kepler-323 and Kepler-104. We used the HIRES instrument at the W.M. Keck Observatory to collect 79 new radial velocity measurements (RVs) for Kepler-323, which we combined with 48 literature RVs from TNG/HARPS-N. We also conducted a reanalysis of the Kepler-104 system, using 44 previously published RV measurements. Kepler-323 b and c have masses of $2.0^{+1.2}_{-1.1}$ M$_\oplus$ and 6.5$\pm1.6$ M$_\oplus$, respectively, whereas the three Kepler-104 planets are more massive (10.0$\pm2.8$ M$_\oplus$, $7.1^{+3.8}_{-3.5}$ M$_\oplus$, and $5.5^{+4.6}_{-3.5}$ M$_\oplus$ for planets b, c, and d, respectively). The Kepler-104 planets have densities consistent with rocky cores overlaid with gaseous envelopes ($4.1^{+1.2}_{-1.1}$ g/cc, $2.9^{+1.7}_{-1.5}$ g/cc, and $1.6^{+1.5}_{-1.1}$ g/cc respectively), whereas the Kepler-323 planets are consistent with having rocky compositions ($4.5^{+2.8}_{-2.4}$ g/cc and $9.9^{+2.7}_{-2.5}$ g/cc). The Kepler-104 system has among the lowest values for gap complexity ($\mathcal{C}$ = 0.004) and mass partitioning ($\mathcal{Q}$ = 0.03); whereas, the Kepler-323 planets have a mass partitioning similar to that of the Inner Solar System ($\mathcal{Q}$ = 0.28 and $\mathcal{Q}$ = 0.24, respectively). For both exoplanet systems, the uncertainty in the mass partitioning is affected equally by (1) individual mass errors of the planets and (2) the possible existence of undetected low-mass planets, meaning that both improved mass characterization and improved sensitivity to low-mass planets in these systems would better elucidate the mass distribution among the planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Existence of strongly bound water molecules on silicate surfaces, above the desorption temperature of water ice, has been first predicted by computational studies and recently demonstrated by laboratory experiments. Such trapped water may be present in various astrophysical environments and there is now evidence for its presence in the diffuse interstellar medium and in extraterrestrial particles. We present here new results of a laboratory study of the phenomenon of trapping (strong bonding) of water molecules by silicates. We show that the efficiency of trapping is strongly dependent on the properties and composition of the surface. Our results point out that the presence of trapped water should be due to the hydrophilic properties of the silicate surface and that the nature of trapping is physical (physisorption rather than chemisorption). We demonstrate that water can be trapped on silicates up to the temperatures of about 470 K, which speaks for the presence of wet silicate grains in the terrestrial planet formation zone in planet-forming disks. Studying the thermal and UV stability of trapped water, we conclude that the detection of trapped water in the diffuse ISM speaks for its efficient continuous formation. We discuss our results as relevant to fundamental scientific questions, such as the oxygen depletion problem, the origin of water on Earth, and the formation of rocky planets.

 - **Abstract**
 EX Hya is one of the best studied, but still enigmatic intermediate polars. We present phase-resolved blue VLT/UVES high-resolution ($\lambda/\Delta \lambda\simeq16.000$) spectra of EX Hya taken in January 2004. Our analysis involves a unique decomposition of the Balmer line profiles into the spin-modulated line wings that represent streaming motions in the magnetosphere and the orbital-phase modulated line core that represents the accretion disk. Spectral analysis and tomography show that the division line between the two is solidly located at $\mid\upsilon_{rad}\mid\simeq1200$ km s$^{-1}$, defining the inner edge of the accretion disk at $r_{in}\simeq{7}\times 10^{9}$ cm or $\sim10 R_1$ (WD radii). This large central hole allows an unimpeded view of the tall accretion curtain at the lower pole with a shock height up to $h_{sh}\sim1 R_1$ that is required by X-ray and optical observations. Our results contradict models that advocate a small magnetosphere and a small inner disk hole. Equating $r_{in}$ with the magnetospheric radius in the orbital plane allows us to derive a magnetic moment of the WD of $\mu_1\simeq1.3\times 10^{32}$ G cm$^{3}$ and a surface field strength $B_1\sim0.35$ MG. Given a polar field strength $B_{p} \lesssim 1.0$ MG, optical circular polarization is not expected. With an accretion rate $\dot M = 3.9\times10^{-11}$ $M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, the accretion torque is $G_{acc}\simeq 2.2 \times 10^{33}$ g cm$^{2}$s$^{-2}$. The magnetostatic torque is of similar magnitude, suggesting that EX Hya is not far from being synchronized. We measured the orbital radial-velocity amplitude of the WD, $K_1=58.7\pm3.9$ km s$^{-1}$, and found a spin-dependent velocity modulation as well. The former is in perfect agreement with the mean velocity amplitude obtained by other researchers, confirming the published component masses $M_1\simeq0.79 M_\odot$ and $M_2\simeq0.11 M_\odot$.

 - **Abstract**
 Much of the information gleaned from observations of star-forming regions comes from the analysis of their molecular emission spectra, particularly in the radio regime. The time-consuming nature of fitting synthetic spectra to observations interactively for such line-rich sources, however, often results in such analysis being limited to data extracted from a single-dish observation or a handful of pixels from an interferometric observation. Yet, star-forming regions display a wide variety of physical conditions that are difficult, if not impossible, to accurately characterize with such a limited number of spectra. We have developed an automated fitting routine that visits every pixel in the field of view of an ALMA data cube and determines the best-fit physical parameters, including excitation temperature and column densities, for a given list of molecules. In this proof-of-concept work, we provide an overview of the fitting routine and apply it to 0".26, 1.1 km s$^{-1}$ resolution ALMA observations of two sites of massive star-formation in NGC 6334I. Parameters were found for 21 distinct molecules by generating synthetic spectra across 7.48 GHz of spectral bandwidth between 280 and 351 GHz. Spatial images of the derived parameters for each of the > 8000 pixels are presented with special attention paid to the C$_2$H$_4$O$_2$ isomers and their relative variations. We highlight the greater scientific utility of the column density and velocity images of individual molecules compared to traditional moment maps of single transitions.

 - **Abstract**
 Ground-based high-resolution spectra provide a powerful tool for characterising exoplanet atmospheres. However, they are greatly hampered by the dominating telluric and stellar lines, which need to be removed prior to any analysis. Such removal techniques ("preparing pipelines") deform the spectrum, hence a key point is to account for this process in the forward models used in retrievals. We develop a formal derivation on how to prepare froward models for retrievals, in the case where the telluric and instrumental deformations can be represented as a matrix multiplied element-wise with the data. We also introduce the notion of "Bias Pipeline Metric" (BPM), that can be used to compare the bias potential of preparing pipelines. We use the resulting framework to retrieve simulated observations of 1-D and 3-D exoplanet atmospheres and to re-analyse high-resolution ($\mathcal{R} \approx 80\,400$) near infrared (0.96--1.71 $\mu$m) CARMENES transit data of HD~189733~b. We compare these results with those obtained from a CCF analysis. With our fiducial retrieval, we find a blueshift of the absorption features of $-5.51^{+0.66}_{-0.53}$ km$\cdot$s$^{-1}$. In addition, we retrieve a H$_2$O $\log_{10}$(VMR) of $-2.39^{+0.12}_{-0.16}$ and a temperature of $660^{+6}_{-11}$ K. We are also able to put upper limits for the abundances of CH$_4$, CO, H$_2$S, HCN and NH$_3$, consistent with a sub-solar metallicity atmosphere enriched in H$_2$O. We retrieve a broadened line shape, consistent with rotation- and wind-induced line broadening. Finally, we find a lower limit for the pressure of an opaque cloud consistent with a clear atmosphere, and find no evidence for hazes.
