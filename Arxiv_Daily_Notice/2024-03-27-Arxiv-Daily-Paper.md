#### Magnetic Helicity Signs and Flaring Propensity: Comparing Force-free  Parameter with the Helicity signs of Hα Filaments and X-ray Sigmoids

 - **Abstract**
 Sigmoids produce strong eruptive events. Earlier studies have shown that the ICME axial magnetic field Bz can be predicted with some credibility by observing the corresponding filament or the polarity inversion line in the region of eruption and deriving the magnetic field direction from that. Sigmoids are coronal structures often associated with filaments in the sigmoidal region. In this study, firstly we compare filament chirality with sigmoid handedness to observe their correlation. Secondly, we perform non-linear force-free approximations of the coronal magnetic connectivity using photospheric vector magnetograms underneath sigmoids to obtain a weighted-average value of the force-free parameter and to correlate it with filament chirality and the observed coronal sigmoid handedness. Importantly, we find that the sigmoids and their filament counterparts do not always have the same helicity signs. Production of eruptive events by regions that do not have the same signs of helicities is $\sim$3.5 times higher than when they do. A case study of magnetic energy/ helicity evolution in NOAA AR 12473 is also presented.

 - **Abstract**
 Dust grains are important in various astrophysical processes and serve as indicators of interstellar medium structures, density, and mass. Understanding their physical properties and chemical composition is crucial in astrophysics. Dust polarization is a valuable tool for studying these properties. The Radiative Torque (RAT) paradigm, which includes Radiative Torque Alignment (RAT-A) and Radiative Torque Disruption (RAT-D), is essential to interpret the dust polarization data and constrain the fundamental properties of dust grains. However, it has been used primarily to interpret observations at a single wavelength. In this study, we analyze the thermal dust polarization spectrum obtained from observations with SOFIA/HAWC+ and JCMT/POL-2 in the OMC-1 region and compare the observational data with our numerical results using the RAT paradigm. We find that the dense gas exhibits a positive spectral slope, whereas the warm regions show a negative one. We demonstrate that a one-layer dust (one-phase) model can only reproduce the observed spectra at certain locations and cannot match those with prominent V-shape spectra (for which the degree of polarization initially decreases with wavelength from 54 to $\sim$ 300$\,\mu$m and then increases at longer wavelengths). To address this, we improve our model by incorporating two dust components (warm and cold) along the line of sight, resulting in a two-phase model. This improved model successfully reproduces the V-shaped spectra. The best model corresponds to a mixture composition of silicate and carbonaceous grains in the cold medium. Finally, by assuming the plausible model of grain alignment, we infer the inclination angle of the magnetic fields in OMC-1. This approach represents an important step toward better understanding the physics of grain alignment and constraining 3D magnetic fields using dust polarization spectrum.
#### RIOJA. Complex Dusty Starbursts in a Major Merger B14-65666 at z=7.15

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST NIRCam imaging of B14-65666 ("Big Three Dragons"), a bright Lyman-break galaxy system ($M_\text{UV}=-22.5$ mag) at $z=7.15$. The high angular resolution of NIRCam reveals the complex morphology of two galaxy components: galaxy E has a compact core (E-core), surrounded by diffuse, extended, rest-frame optical emission, which is likely to be tidal tails; and galaxy W has a clumpy and elongated morphology with a blue UV slope ($\beta_\text{UV}=-2.2\pm0.1$). The flux excess, F356W$-$F444W, peaks at the E-core ($1.05^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ mag), tracing the presence of strong [OIII] 4960,5008 \r{A} emission. ALMA archival data show that the bluer galaxy W is brighter in dust continua than the redder galaxy E, while the tails are bright in [OIII] 88 $\mathrm{\mu m}$. The UV/optical and sub-mm SED fitting confirms that B14-65666 is a major merger in a starburst phase as derived from the stellar mass ratio (3:1 to 2:1) and the star-formation rate, $\simeq1$ dex higher than the star-formation main sequence at the same redshift. The galaxy E is a dusty ($A_\text{V}=1.2\pm0.1$ mag) starburst with a possible high dust temperature ($\ge63$-$68$ K). The galaxy W would have a low dust temperature ($\le27$-$33$ K) or patchy stellar-and-dust geometry, as suggested from the infrared excess (IRX) and $\beta_\text{UV}$ diagram. The high optical-to-FIR [OIII] line ratio of the E-core shows its lower gas-phase metallicity ($\simeq0.2$ Z$_{\odot}$) than the galaxy W. These results agree with a scenario where major mergers disturb morphology and induce nuclear dusty starbursts triggered by less-enriched inflows. B14-65666 shows a picture of complex stellar buildup processes during major mergers in the epoch of reionization.

 - **Abstract**
 The connection between the binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) and their stellar progenitors remains uncertain. Specifically, the fraction $\epsilon$ of stellar mass that ends up in BBH mergers and the delay time $\tau$ between star formation and BBH merger carry information about the astrophysical processes that give rise to merging BBHs. We model the BBH merger rate in terms of the cosmic star formation history, coupled with a metallicity-dependent efficiency $\epsilon$ and a distribution of delay times $\tau$, and infer these parameters with data from the Third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). We find that the progenitors to merging BBHs preferentially form in low metallicity environments with a low metallicity efficiency of $\log_{10}\epsilon_{<Z_t}=-3.99^{+0.68}_{-0.87}$ and a high metallicity efficiency of $\log_{10}\epsilon_{<Z_t}=-4.60^{+0.30}_{-0.34}$ at the 90% credible level. The data also prefer short delay times. For a power-law distribution $p(\tau)\propto \tau^\alpha$, we find $\tau_\text{min}<1.9 $ Gyr and $\alpha<-1.32$ at 90% credibility. Our model allows us to extrapolate the mass density in BBHs out to high redshifts. We cumulatively integrate our modelled density rate over cosmic time to get the total mass density of merging stellar mass BBHs as a function of redshift. Today, stellar-mass BBH mergers make up only $\sim 0.01\%$ of the total stellar mass density created by high-mass ($>10\,M_\odot$) progenitors. However, because massive stars are so short-lived, there may be more mass in merging BBHs than in living massive stars as early as $\sim 2.5$ Gyr ago. We also compare to the mass in supermassive BHs, finding that the mass densities were comparable $\sim 12.5$ Gyr ago, but the mass density in SMBHs quickly increased to $\sim 75$ times the mass density in merging stellar mass BBHs by $z\sim 1$.
#### Runaway OB Stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud III. Updated Kinematics  and Insights on Dynamical vs. Supernova Ejections

 - **Abstract**
 We use the kinematics of field OB stars to estimate the frequencies of runaway stars generated by the dynamical ejection scenario (DES), the binary supernova scenario (BSS), and the combined two-step mechanism. We update the proper motions for field OB and OBe stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using Gaia DR3. Our sample now contains 336 stars from the Runaways and Isolated O-Type Star Spectroscopic Survey of the SMC (RIOTS4), and we update our algorithm to calculate more accurate velocities compared to those obtained previously from DR2. We find a decrease in median velocity from 39 to 29 km/s, implying that the proper motions from our previous work were systematically overestimated. We present the velocity distribution for OBe stars and quantitatively compare it to those of non-compact binaries and high-mass X-ray binaries. We confirm that OBe stars appear to be dominated by the BSS and are likely post-SN binary systems, further supporting the mass-transfer model to explain the origin of their emission-line disks. In contrast, normal OB stars may show a bimodal velocity distribution, as may be expected from different processes that occur with dynamical ejections. The kinematics of fast-rotating OB stars are similar to those of normal OB stars rather than OBe stars, suggesting that the origin of their high v_r*sin(i) is different from that of OBe stars. We update our model parameters describing the kinematic origins of the SMC field population, still confirming that for runaway stars, the DES mechanism dominates, and two-step ejections seem comparable in frequency to pure BSS ejections.

 - **Abstract**
 The quantum kinetic evolution of neutrinos in dense environments, such as the core-collapse supernovae or the neutron star mergers, can result in fast flavor conversion (FFC), presenting a significant challenge to achieving robust astrophysical modeling of these systems. Recent works that directly simulate the quantum kinetic transport of neutrinos in localized domains have suggested that the asymptotic outcome of FFCs can be modeled by simple analytical prescriptions. In this Letter, we incorporate the analytical prescriptions into global simulations that solve the classical neutrino transport equation including collisions and advection under spherical symmetry. We demonstrate excellent agreement between results obtained using this approach and those directly from the corresponding global quantum kinetic simulations. In particular, this effective method can also precisely capture the collisional feedback effect for cases where the FFC happens inside the neutrinosphere. Our work highlights that a robust integration of FFCs in classical neutrino transport used in astrophysical simulation can be feasible.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the attainable maximum energy of particles accelerated in the core-collapse supernova remnant (SNR) shock propagating in the free wind region with the Parker-spiral magnetic field, current sheet, and the wind termination shock (WTS) by using test particle simulations. This work focuses on Wolf-Rayet stars as progenitors. The magnetic field amplification in the free wind region (shock upstream region) is not considered in this work. Test particle simulations show that particles escaped from the core-collapse SNR reach and move along the WTS, and eventually return to the SNR shock from the poles or equator of the WTS. The particle attainable energy can be boosted by this cyclic motion between the SNR shock and WTS and can be larger than the particle energy that is limited by escape from the SNR shock. The particle energy limited by the cyclic motion between the SNR shock and WTS is about $10-100~{\rm TeV}$. Thus, the core-collapse SNR without upstream magnetic field amplification can be the origin of the break around $10~{\rm TeV}$ of the energy spectrum of observed cosmic ray protons and helium.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar energetic particle (SEP) events are one of the most crucial aspects of space weather that require continuous monitoring and forecasting. Their prediction depends on various factors including source eruptions. In the present work, we use the Geostationary Solar Energetic Particle (GSEP) data set covering solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. We develop a framework using time series-based machine learning (ML) models with the aim of developing robust short-term forecasts by classifying SEP events. For this purpose, we introduce an ensemble learning approach that merges the results from univariate time series of three proton channels (10 MeV, 50 MeV, and 100 MeV) and the long band X-ray flux channel from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) missions and analyze their performance. We consider three models, namely, time series forest (TSF), supervised time series forest (STSF) and bag of SFA symbols (BOSS). Our study also focuses on understanding and developing confidence in the predictive capabilities of our models. Therefore, we utilize multiple evaluation techniques and metrics. Based on that, we find STSF to perform well in all scenarios. The summary of metrics for the STSF model is as follows: AUC = 0.981; F1-score = 0.960; TSS = 0.919; HSS = 0.920; GSS = 0.852; and MCC = 0.920. The Brier score loss of the STSF model is 0.077. This work lays the foundation for building near-real-time (NRT) short-term SEP event predictions using robust ML methods.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation history of Jupiter has been of interest due to its ability to shape the solar system's history. Yet little attention has been paid to the formation and growth of Saturn and the other giant planets. Here, we explore the implications of the simplest disc and pebble accretion model with steady-state accretion on the formation of giant planets in the solar system through N-body simulations. We conducted a statistical survey of different disc parameters and initial conditions of the protoplanetary disc to establish which combination best reproduces the present outer solar system. We examined the effect of the initial planetesimal disc mass, the number of planetesimals and their size-frequency distribution slope, pebble accretion prescription, and sticking efficiency on the likelihood of forming gas giants and their orbital distribution. The results reveal that the accretion sticking efficiency is the most sensitive parameter for controlling the final masses and number of giant planets. We have been unable to replicate the formation of all three types of giant planets in the solar system in a single simulation. The probability distribution of the final location of the giant planets is approximately constant in $\log r$, suggesting there is a slight preference for formation closer to the Sun but no preference for more massive planets to form closer. The eccentricity distribution has a higher mean for more massive planets, indicating that systems with more massive planets are more violent. The formation timescales of the cores of the gas giants are distinct, suggesting that they formed sequentially.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of ten new pulsars in the globular cluster Terzan 5 as part of the Transients and Pulsars with MeerKAT (TRAPUM) Large Survey Project. We observed Terzan 5 at L-band (856--1712 MHz) with the MeerKAT radio telescope for four hours on two epochs, and performed acceleration searches of 45 out of 288 tied-array beams covering the core of the cluster. We obtained phase-connected timing solutions for nine discoveries, covering nearly two decades of archival observations from the Green Bank Telescope for all but one. Highlights include PSR J1748$-$2446ao which is an eccentric ($e = 0.32$) wide-orbit (orbital period $P_{\rm b} = 57.55$ d) system. We were able to measure the rate of advance of periastron ($\dot{\omega}$) for this system allowing us to determine a total mass of $3.17 \pm \, 0.02\, \rm M_{\odot}$. With a minimum companion mass ($M_{\rm c}$) of $\sim 0.8\, \rm M_{\odot}$, PSR J1748$-$2446ao is a candidate double neutron star (DNS) system. If confirmed to be a DNS, it would be the fastest spinning pulsar ($P = 2.27$ ms) and the longest orbital period measured for any known DNS system. PSR J1748$-$2446ap has the second highest eccentricity for any recycled pulsar ($e \sim 0.905$) and for this system we can measure the total mass ($1.997 \pm 0.006\, \rm M_{\odot}$) and also estimate the individual pulsar and companion masses. PSR J1748$-$2446ar is an eclipsing redback (minimum $M_{\rm c} \sim 0.34\, \rm M_{\odot}$) system whose properties confirm it to be the counterpart to a previously published source identified in radio and X-ray imaging. With these discoveries, the total number of confirmed pulsars in Terzan 5 is 49, the highest for any globular cluster so far. These discoveries further enhance the rich set of pulsars known in Terzan 5 and provide scope for a deeper understanding of binary stellar evolution, cluster dynamics and ensemble population studies.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents bounds on transient variations of fundamental constants, with typical timescales ranging from minutes to months, using clocks in space. The underlying phenomenology describing such transient variations relies on models for Dark Matter (DM) which suggest possible encounters of macroscopic compact objects with the Earth, due to the motion of the solar system in the galactic halo. If such compact objects possess an effective feeble interaction with the ordinary matter beyond the gravitational one, it may result in effective transient variations of fundamental constants. Such variations leave signatures on clocks onboard GNSS satellites. In this paper, we introduce a phenomenological study dedicated to the search for such DM transient objects using the network of passive hydrogen masers (H-Masers) onboard Galileo satellites. We first model the signature of transient variations of fundamental constants as a frequency modulation in the difference between two satellite clocks, considering the satellite trajectories relative to the transient event. Then, we present first results based on a fast analysis method, the maximum reach analysis. The main result is a significant extension of the discovery range for DM transients, with a sensitivity never achieved before. We investigate indeed the range of transient sizes from $10^5$ to $10^9$ kilometres, which, apart from indirect and model-dependent non-transient effects, has never been explored previously.
