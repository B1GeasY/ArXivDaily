#### Revisiting the gas-phase chemical rate coefficients at high temperatures  in CLOUDY

 - **Abstract**
 A two-body gas-phase reaction rate coefficient can be given by the usual Arrhenius-type formula which depends on temperature. The UMIST Database for Astrochemistry is a widely used database for reaction rate coefficients. They provide fittings for coefficients valid over a particular range of temperatures. The permissible upper-temperature limits vary over a wide range: from 100 K to 41000K. A wide range of temperatures occurs in nature; thus, it requires evaluating the rate coefficients at temperatures outside the range of validity. As a result, a simple extrapolation of the rate coefficients can lead to unphysically large values at high temperatures. These result in unrealistic predictions. Here we present a solution to prevent the gas-phase reaction coefficients from diverging at a very high temperature. We implement this into the spectral synthesis code CLOUDY which operates over a wide range of temperatures from CMB to 10$^{10}$ K subject to different astrophysical environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cameras for Allsky Meteor Surveillance (CAMS) project, funded by NASA starting in 2010, aims to map our meteor showers by triangulating meteor trajectories detected in low-light video cameras from multiple locations across 16 countries in both the northern and southern hemispheres. Its mission is to validate, discover, and predict the upcoming returns of meteor showers. Our research aimed to streamline the data processing by implementing an automated cloud-based AI-enabled pipeline and improve the data visualization to improve the rate of discoveries by involving the public in monitoring the meteor detections. This article describes the process of automating the data ingestion, processing, and insight generation using an interpretable Active Learning and AI pipeline. This work also describes the development of an interactive web portal (the NASA Meteor Shower portal) to facilitate the visualization of meteor radiant maps. To date, CAMS has discovered over 200 new meteor showers and has validated dozens of previously reported showers.
#### Snowflakes in a furnace: formation of CO and dust in a recurrent nova  eruption
 - **Authors:** D. P. K. Banerjee, C. E. Woodward, V. Joshi, A. Evans, F. M. Walter, G. H. Marion, E. Y. Hsiao, N. M. Ashok, R. D. Gehrz, S. Starrfield

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of carbon monoxide (CO) and dust, formed under hostile conditions, in recurrent nova V745 Sco about 8.7 days after its 2014 outburst. The formation of molecules or dust has not been recorded previously in the ejecta of a recurrent nova. The mass and temperature of the CO and dust are estimated to be T(CO) = 2250 +/- 250 K, M(CO) = (1 to 5) E-8 solar masses, and T(dust) = 1000 +/- 50 K, M(dust) approximately E-8 to E-9 solar masses respectively. At the time of their detection, the shocked gas was at a high temperature of approximately E+7 K as evidenced by the presence of coronal lines. The ejecta were simultaneously irradiated by a large flux of soft X-ray radiation from the central white dwarf. Molecules and dust are not expected to form and survive in such harsh conditions; they are like snowflakes in a furnace. However, it has been posited in other studies that, as the nova ejecta plow through the red giant's wind, a region exists between the forward and reverse shocks that is cool, dense and clumpy where the dust and CO could likely form. We speculate that this site may also be a region of particle acceleration, thereby contributing to the generation of gamma-rays.
#### Djerfisherite: Nebular Source of Refractory Potassium

 - **Abstract**
 Djerfisherite is an important carrier of potassium in highly reduced enstatite chondrites, where it occurs in sub-round metal-sulfide nodules. These nodules were once free-floating objects in the protoplanetary nebula. Here, we analyze existing and new data to derive an equation of state (EOS) for djerfisherites of K_{6}(Cu,Fe,Ni)^{B} (Fe,Ni,Cu)^{C}_{24} S_{26}Cl structural formula. We use this EOS to calculate the thermal stability of djerfisherite coexisting in equilibrium with a cooling vapor of solar composition enriched in a dust analogous to anhydrous, chondritic interplanetary dust (C-IDP). We find that condensed mineral assemblages closely match those found in enstatite chondrites, with djerfisherite condensing above 1000 K in C-IDP dust enriched systems. Results may have implications for the volatile budgets of terrestrial planets, and the incorporation of K into early-formed, highly reduced, planetary cores. Previous work links enstatite chondrites to the planet Mercury, where the surface has a terrestrial K/Th ratio, high S/Si ratio, and very low FeO content. Mercury's accretion history may yield insights into Earth's.
#### Bayesian inference from gravitational waves in fast-rotating,  core-collapse supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are prime candidates for gravitational-wave detectors. The analysis of their complex waveforms can potentially provide information on the physical processes operating during the collapse of the iron cores of massive stars. In this work we analyze the early-bounce rapidly rotating CCSN signals reported in the waveform catalog of Richers et al 2017, which comprises over 1800 axisymmetric simulations extending up to about $10$~ms of post-bounce evolution. It was previously established that for a large range of progenitors, the amplitude of the bounce signal, $\Delta h$, is proportional to the ratio of rotational-kinetic energy to potential energy, T/|W|, and the peak frequency, $f_{\rm peak}$, is proportional to the square root of the central rest-mass density. In this work, we exploit these relations to suggest that it could be possible to use such waveforms to infer protoneutron star properties from a future gravitational wave observation, if the distance and inclination are well known. Our approach relies on the ability to describe a subset of the waveforms in the early post-bounce phase in a simple template form depending only on two parameters, $\Delta h$ and $f_{\rm peak}$. We use this template to perform a Bayesian inference analysis of waveform injections in Gaussian colored noise for a network of three gravitational wave detectors formed by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. We show that it is possible to recover the injected parameters, peak frequency and amplitude, with an accuracy better than 10% for more than 50% of the detectable signals (given known distance and inclination angle). However, inference on waveforms from outside the Richers catalog is not reliable, indicating a need for carefully verified waveforms of the first 10 ms after bounce of rapidly rotating supernovae of different progenitors with agreement between different codes.

 - **Abstract**
 We universally search for evidence of kinematic and spatial correlation of supernova remnant (SNR) and molecular cloud (MC) associations for nearly all SNRs in the coverage of the MWISP CO survey, i.e. 149 SNRs, 170 SNR candidates, and 18 pure pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) in 1 deg < l < 230 deg and -5.5 deg < b < 5.5 deg. Based on high quality and unbiased 12CO/13CO/C18O (J = 1--0) survey data, we apply automatic algorithms to identify broad lines and spatial correlations for molecular gas in each SNR region. The 91 percent of SNR-MC associations detected previously are identified in this paper by CO line emission. Overall, there could be as high as 80 percent of SNRs associated with MCs. The proportion of SNRs associated with MCs is high within the Galactic longitude less than ~50 deg. Kinematic distances of all SNRs that are associated with MCs are estimated based on systemic velocities of associated MCs. The radius of SNRs associated with MCs follows a lognormal distribution, which peaks at ~8.1 pc. The progenitor initial mass of these SNRs follows a power-law distribution with an index of ~-2.3 that is consistent with the Salpeter index of -2.35. We find that SNR-MC associations are mainly distributed in a thin disk along the Galactic plane, while a small amount distributed in a thick disk. With the height of these SNRs from the Galactic plane below ~45 pc, the distribution of the average radius relative to the height of them is roughly flat, and the average radius increases with the height when above ~45 pc.
