 - **Abstract**
 Discovering new actively-accreting protoplanets is crucial to answering open questions about planet formation. However, identifying such planets at orbital distances where they are expected to be abundant is extremely challenging, both due to the technical requirements and large distances to star-forming regions. Here we use the kernel phase interferometry (KPI) technique to search for companions around the $\sim$6 and $\sim$8 Myr old Herbig Ae stars MWC 758 and MWC 480. KPI is a data analysis technique which is sensitive to moderate asymmetries, arising from eg. a circumstellar disk or companions with contrasts of up to 6-8 mags, at separations down to and even below the classical Rayleigh diffraction limit ($\sim 1.2\lambda / D$). Using the high spectral resolution K-band mode of the SCExAO/CHARIS integral field spectrograph, we search for both excess Br-$\gamma$ line emission and continuum emission from companions around MWC 480 and MWC 758. We are able to set limits on the presence of rapidly accreting protoplanets and brown dwarfs between 4 and 16 au, well interior to those of previous studies. In Br-$\gamma$, we set limits on excess line emission equivalent to accretion rates ranging from $10^{-5} M_{j}^{2}.yr^{-1}$ to $10^{-6}M_{j}^{2}.yr^{-1}$. Our achievable contrasts demonstrate that KPI using SCExAO/CHARIS is a promising technique to search for giant accreting protoplanets at smaller separations compared to conventional imaging.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the influence of bulk viscosity on late-time cosmic acceleration within an extended $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity framework, where the non-metricity $Q$ is non-minimally coupled with the matter Lagrangian $L_m$. Analyzing the function $f(Q, L_m) = \alpha Q + \beta L_m$, we derive exact solutions under non-relativistic matter domination. Using observational datasets ($H(z)$, Pantheon supernovae, and their combination), we constrain the model parameters $H_0$, $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\zeta$. The deceleration parameter transitions from positive to negative values around redshifts $z_t \approx 0.80$ to $0.99 $, indicating current accelerated expansion. Moreover, the effective equation of state parameter, $\omega_{eff}$, resembles quintessence dark energy ($-1 < \omega_{eff} < -\frac{1}{3}$), with corresponding values from respective datasets. Finally, we use the $Om(z)$ diagnostic, which confirms that our model demonstrates quintessence-like behavior. Our findings underscore the significant role of bulk viscosity in understanding accelerated expansion in the universe within alternative gravity theories.

 - **Abstract**
 HESS J1809-193 is an unidentified TeV source, first detected by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) Collaboration. The emission originates in a source-rich region that includes several Supernova Remnants (SNR) and Pulsars (PSR) including SNR G11.1+0.1, SNR G11.0-0.0, and the young radio pulsar J1809-1917. Originally classified as a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) candidate, recent studies show the peak of the TeV region overlapping with a system of molecular clouds. This resulted in the revision of the original leptonic scenario to look for alternate hadronic scenarios. Marked as a potential PeVatron candidate, this region has been studied extensively by H.E.S.S. due to its emission extending up-to several tens of TeV. In this work, we use 2398 days of data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory to carry out a systematic source search for the HESS J1809-193 region. We were able to resolve emission detected as an extended component (modelled as a Symmetric Gaussian with a 1 $\sigma$ radius of 0.21 $^\circ$) with no clear cutoff at high energies and emitting photons up-to 210 TeV. We model the multi-wavelength observations for the region HESS J1809-193 using a time-dependent leptonic model and a lepto-hadronic model. Our model indicates that both scenarios could explain the observed data within the region of HESS J1809-193.
#### The effect of spectroscopic binning on atmospheric retrievals

 - **Abstract**
 With the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) offering higher resolution data in space-based transmission spectroscopy, understanding the capabilities of our current atmospheric retrieval pipelines is essential. These new data cover wider wavelength ranges and at much higher spectral resolution than previous instruments have been able to offer. Therefore, it is often appealing to bin spectra to fewer points, better constrained in their transit depth, before using them as inputs for atmospheric retrievals. However, little quantitative analysis of the trade-off between spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio has been conducted thus far. As such, we produce a simulation replicating the observations of WASP-39b by the NIRSpec PRISM instrument on board JWST and assess the accuracy and consistency of retrievals while varying resolution and the average photometric error. While this probes a specific case we also plot `binning paths' in the resulting sensitivity maps to demonstrate the best attainable atmospheric parameter estimations starting from the position of the real JWST Early Release Science observation. We repeat this analysis on three different simulation setups where each includes an opaque cloud layer at a different height in the atmosphere. We find that a much greater resolution is needed in the case of a high cloud deck since features are already heavily muted by the presence of the clouds. In the other two cases, there are large `safe zones' in the parameter space. If these maps can be generalised, binning paths could inform future observations on how to achieve the most accurate retrieval results.
#### Thermodynamics of Giant Molecular Clouds: The Effects of Dust Grain Size

 - **Abstract**
 The dust grain size distribution (GSD) likely varies significantly across different star-forming environments in the Universe, but the overall impact of this variation on star formation remains unclear. This ambiguity arises because the GSD interacts non-linearly with processes like heating/cooling, radiation, and chemistry, which have competing effects and different environmental dependencies. In this study, we investigate the effects of GSD variation on the thermochemistry and evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs). To achieve this, we conducted radiation-dust-magnetohydrodynamic simulations spanning a range of cloud masses and grain sizes, which explicitly incorporate the dynamics of dust grains within the full-physics framework of the STARFORGE project. We find that differences in grain size significantly alter the thermochemistry of GMCs. Specifically, we show that the leading-order effect is that larger grains, under fixed dust mass and dust-to-gas ratio conditions, result in lower dust opacities. This reduced opacity permits ISRF photons to penetrate more deeply and allows internal radiation field photons to permeate more extensively into the cloud, resulting in rapid gas heating and the inhibition of star formation. We find that star formation efficiency is highly sensitive to grain size, with an order of magnitude reduction in efficiency when grain size increases from 0.1 $\rm\mu m$ to 10 $\rm\mu m$. Additionally, we note that warmer gas suppresses the formation of low-mass stars. Moreover, as a consequence of the decreased opacities, we observe a greater proportion of gas residing in diffuse ionized structures.
#### A grid of self-consistent MSG (MARCS-StaticWeather-GGchem) cool stellar, sub-stellar, and exoplanetary model atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 Computation of a grid of self consistent 1D model atmospheres of cool stars, sub-stellar objects and exoplanets in the effective temperature range 300K to 3000K, including cloud formation, chemical non-equilibrium effects, and stellar irradiation. The models are called MSG, because they are based on an iterative coupling between three well tested codes, the MARCS stellar atmosphere code, the StaticWeather cloud formation code and the GGchem chemical equilibrium code. It includes up-to-date molecular and atomic opacities, cloud formation and advanced chemical equilibrium calculations, and involves new numerical methods at low temperatures to allow robust convergence. The coupling between the MARCS radiative transfer and GGchem chemical equilibrium computations has made it possibly effectively to reach convergence based on electron pressure for the warmer models and gas pressure for the cooler models, enabling self-consistent modelling of stellar, sub-stellar and exoplanetary objects in a very wide range of effective temperatures. Here we describe the basic details of the models, with illustrative examples of cloudy and irradiated models as well as models based on non-equilibrium chemistry. The qualitative changes in the relative abundances of TiO, H2O, CH4, NH3, and other molecules in our models follow the observationally defined M, L, T (and Y) sequences, but reveal more complex and depth dependent abundance changes, and therefore a spectral classification depending on more parameters. The self consistent coupling to Static-Weather cloud computations, allows detailed comparison between nucleation and observed relative dimming of different spectral bands, with advanced applications for new identification methods of potential exoplanetary biology.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a flow-based generative approach to emulate grids of stellar evolutionary models. By interpreting the input parameters and output properties of these models as multi-dimensional probability distributions, we train conditional normalizing flows to learn and predict the complex relationships between grid inputs and outputs in the form of conditional joint distributions. Leveraging the expressive power and versatility of these flows, we showcase their ability to emulate a variety of evolutionary tracks and isochrones across a continuous range of input parameters. In addition, we describe a simple Bayesian approach for estimating stellar parameters using these flows and demonstrate its application to asteroseismic datasets of red giants observed by the Kepler mission. By applying this approach to red giants in open clusters NGC 6791 and NGC 6819, we illustrate how large age uncertainties can arise when fitting only to global asteroseismic and spectroscopic parameters without prior information on initial helium abundances and mixing length parameter values. We also conduct inference using the flow at a large scale by determining revised estimates of masses and radii for 15,388 field red giants. These estimates show improved agreement with results from existing grid-based modelling, reveal distinct population-level features in the red clump, and suggest that the masses of Kepler red giants previously determined using the corrected asteroseismic scaling relations have been overestimated by 5-10%.
