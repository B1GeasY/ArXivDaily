 - **Abstract**
 We assess the variance of supernova(SN)-like explosions associated with the core collapse of rotating massive stars into a black hole-accretion disc system under changes in the progenitor structure. Our model of the central engine evolves the black hole and the disc through the transfer of matter and angular momentum and includes the contribution of the disc wind. We perform two-dimensional, non-relativistic, hydrodynamics simulations using the open-source hydrodynamic code Athena++, for which we develop a method to calculate self-gravity for axially symmetric density distributions. For a fixed model of the wind injection, we explore the explosion characteristics for progenitors with zero-age main-sequence masses from 9 to 40 $M_\odot$ and different degrees of rotation. Our outcomes reveal a wide range of explosion energies with $E_\mathrm{expl}$ spanning from $\sim 0.3\times10^{51}$~erg to $ > 8\times 10^{51}$~erg and ejecta mass $M_\mathrm{ej}$ from $\sim 0.6$ to $> 10 M_\odot$. Our results are in agreement with some range of the observational data of stripped-envelope and high-energy SNe such as broad-lined type Ic SNe, but we measure a stronger correlation between $E_\mathrm{expl}$ and $M_\mathrm{ej}$. We also provide an estimate of the $^{56}$Ni mass produced in our models which goes from $\sim0.04\;M_\odot$ to $\sim 1.3\;M_\odot$. The $^{56}$Ni mass shows a correlation with the mass and the angular velocity of the progenitor: more massive and faster rotating progenitors tend to produce a higher amount of $^{56}$Ni. Finally, we present a criterion that allows the selection of a potential collapsar progenitor from the observed explosion energy.
#### Identifying a point-symmetrical morphology in the core-collapse supernova remnant W44

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)

 - **Abstract**
 I identify a point-symmetrical morphology in the core-collapse supernova remnant (CCSNR) W44 compatible with shaping by three or more pairs of jets in the jittering jet explosion mechanism (JJEM). Motivated by recent identifications of point-symmetrical morphologies in CCSNRs and their match to the JJEM, I revisit the morphological classification of CCSNR W44. I examine a radio map of W44 and find the outer bright rim of the radio map to possess a point-symmetric structure compatible with shaping by two energetic pairs of opposite jets rather than an S-shaped morphology shaped by a precessing pair of jets. An inner pair of filaments might hint at a third powerful pair of jets. More pairs of jets were involved in the explosion process. This study adds to the growing evidence that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the influence of Herbig-Haro jets on initiating star formation in dense environments. When molecular clouds are nearing gravitational instability, the impact of a protostellar jet could provide the impetus needed to catalyse star formation. A high-energy-density experiment was carried out at the LULI2000 laser facility, where a supersonic jet generated by a nanosecond laser was used to compress a foam or plastic ball, mimicking the interaction of a Herbig-Haro jet with a molecular cloud. Simulations using the 3D radiation hydrodynamics code TROLL provided comprehensive data for analysing ball compression and calculating jet characteristics. After applying scaling laws, similarities between stellar and experimental jets were explored. Diagnostic simulations, including density gradient, emission and X-ray radiographies, showed strong agreement with experimental data. The results of the experiment, supported by simulations, demonstrated that the impact of a protostellar jet on a molecular cloud could reduce the Bonnor-Ebert mass by approximately 9%, thereby initiating collapse.
#### Modelling of the atomic lines emission of fast moving pulsar nebulae

 - **Abstract**
 Bow shocks generated by pulsars moving through weakly ionized interstellar medium (ISM) produce emission dominated by non-equilibrium atomic transitions. These bow shocks are primarily observed as H$_\alpha$ nebulae. We developed a package, named Shu, that calculates non-LTE intensity maps in more than 150 spectral lines, taking into account geometrical properties of the pulsars' motion and lines of sight. We argue here that atomic (CI, NI, OI) and ionic (SII, NII, OIII, NeIV) transitions can be used as complementary and sensitive probes of ISM. We perform self-consistent 2D relativistic hydrodynamic calculations of the bow shock structure and generate non-LTE emissivity maps, combining global dynamics of relativistic flows, and detailed calculations of the non-equilibrium ionization states. We find that though typically H$_\alpha$ emission is dominant, spectral fluxes in OIII, SII and NII may become comparable for relatively slowly moving pulsars. Overall, morphology of non-LTE emission, especially of the ionic species, is a sensitive probe of the density structures of the ISM.
