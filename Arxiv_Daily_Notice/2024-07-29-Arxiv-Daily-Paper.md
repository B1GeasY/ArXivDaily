 - **Abstract**
 The relation between magnetic field strength B and gas density n in the interstellar medium is of fundamental importance to many areas of astrophysics, from protostellar disks to galaxy evolution. We present and compare Bayesian analyses of the B - n relation for a comprehensive observational data set, as well as a large body of numerical MHD simulations. We extend the original Zeeman relation of Crutcher et al. (2010) with a large body of magnetic data that includes 700 observations with the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. By using a new multiparameter Bayesian analysis we present a new, more general, time-averaged observational relation: B \propto n^{0.27 \pm 0.017} for n \leq n_0 and B \propto n^{0.54 \pm 0.18} for n \geq n_0, with n_0 = 924^(+145-144) cm^-3. We perform a separate analysis on 19 numerical magnetohydrodynamics simulations that cover a wide range of scales, resolutions, initial conditions, and completed with a variety of codes: arepo, flash, pencil, and ramses. The power law exponents derived from the simulations depend on several physical factors including: dynamo effects, time scales, turbulence, and the initial seed field strength. In particular, early-time simulations where the density, velocity and magnetic fields are unevolved do not match the observational scalings. The simulations that trace the observed density range best, the evolved dwarf galaxy and Milky Way like galaxy simulations, settle into a near consistent exponent of = 0.5 in the dense gas, with variability in the diffuse gas exponent.

 - **Abstract**
 Age is the most difficult fundamental stellar parameter to infer for isolated stars. While isochrone-based ages are in general imprecise for both main sequence dwarfs and red giants, precise isochrone-based ages can be obtained for stars on the subgiant branch transitioning from core to shell hydrogen burning. We synthesize Gaia DR3-based distance inferences, multiwavelength photometry from the ultraviolet to the mid infrared, and three-dimensional extinction maps to construct a sample of 289,759 solar-metallicity stars amenable to accurate, precise, and physically self-consistent age inferences. Using subgiants in the solar-metallicity open clusters NGC 2682 (i.e., M 67) and NGC 188, we show that our approach yields accurate and physically self-consistent ages and metallicities with median statistical precisions of 8\% and 0.06 dex. The inclusion of systematic uncertainties resulting from non-single or variable stars results in age and metallicity precisions of 9\% and 0.12 dex. We supplement this solar-metallicity sample with an additional 112,062 metal-poor subgiants, including over 3,000 stars with $[\text{Fe/H}]\lesssim-1.50$, 7\% age precisions, and apparent Gaia $G$-band magnitudes $G<14$. We further demonstrate that our inferred metallicities agree with those produced by multiplexed spectroscopic surveys. As an example of the scientific potential of this catalog, we show that the solar neighborhood star-formation history has three components at $([\text{Fe/H}],\tau/\text{Gyr}) \approx (+0.0,4)$, $(+0.2,7)$, and a roughly linear sequence in age--metallicity space beginning at $([\text{Fe/H}],\tau/\text{Gyr})\approx(+0.2,7)$ and extending to $(-0.5,13)$. Our analyses indicate that the solar neighborhood includes stars on disk-like orbits even at the oldest ages and lowest metallicities accessible by our samples.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields play an important role in shaping and regulating star formation in molecular clouds. Here, we present one of the first studies examining the relative orientations between magnetic ($B$) fields and the dust emission, gas column density, and velocity centroid gradients on the 0.02 pc (core) scales, using the BISTRO and VLA+GBT observations of the NGC 1333 star-forming clump. We quantified these relative orientations using the Project Rayleigh Statistic (PRS) and found preferential global parallel alignment between the $B$ field and dust emission gradients, consistent with large-scale studies with Planck. No preferential global alignments, however, are found between the $B$ field and velocity gradients. Local PRS calculated for subregions defined by either dust emission or velocity coherence further revealed that the $B$ field does not preferentially align with dust emission gradients in most emission-defined subregions, except in the warmest ones. The velocity-coherent structures, on the other hand, also showed no preferred $B$ field alignments with velocity gradients, except for one potentially bubble-compressed region. Interestingly, the velocity gradient magnitude in NGC 1333 ubiquitously features prominent ripple-like structures that are indicative of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. Finally, we found $B$ field alignments with the emission gradients to correlate with dust temperature and anticorrelate with column density, velocity dispersion, and velocity gradient magnitude. The latter two anticorrelations suggest that alignments between gas structures and $B$ fields can be perturbed by physical processes that elevate velocity dispersion and velocity gradients, such as infall, accretions, and MHD waves.
#### Parameterization of the frequency spectrum of radio emission in the 30-80 MHz band from inclined air showers

 - **Abstract**
 To exploit the wealth of information carried by the short transient radio pulses from air showers, the frequency spectra of the signals have to be investigated. Here, we study the spectral content of radio signals produced by inclined showers, with a focus on the 30-80 MHz frequency band, as measured, for example, by the antennas of the Pierre Auger Observatory. Two exponential models are investigated and used to describe the spectral shape of the Geomagnetic and Charge-excess components of the pulses. The spectral fitting procedure of the models is described in detail. For both components, a parameterization of the frequency slope as a function of the lateral distance to the shower axis and the geometrical distance between core and shower maximum is derived. For the Geomagnetic component, a quadratic correction to the frequency slope is needed to better describe the spectrum, and it has been parameterized, too. These pieces of information can be employed in event reconstruction to constrain the geometry, in particular the core position.

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is critical to our understanding of star formation and the effects of young stars on their environment. On large scales, it enables us to use tracers such as UV or Halpha emission to estimate the star formation rate of a system and interpret unresolved star clusters across the universe. So far, there is little firm evidence of large-scale variations of the IMF, which is thus generally considered universal. Stars form from cores and it is now possible to estimate core masses and compare the core mass function (CMF) with the IMF, which it presumably produces. The goal of the ALMA-IMF large program is to measure the core mass function at high linear resolution (2700 au) in 15 typical Milky Way protoclusters spanning a mass range of 2500 to 32700 Msun. In this work, we used two different core extraction algorithms to extract about 680 gravitationally bound cores from these 15 protoclusters. We adopt per core temperature using the temperature estimate from the PPMAP Bayesian method. A power-law fit to the CMF of the sub-sample of cores above the 1.64 Msun completeness limit, 330 cores, through the maximum likelihood estimate technique yields a slope of 1.97 +/- 0.06, significantly flatter than the 2.35 Salpeter slope. Assuming a self-similar mapping between the CMF and the IMF, this result implies that these 15 high-mass protoclusters will generate atypical IMFs. This sample is the largest to date produced and analysed self-consistently, derived at matched physical resolution, with per-core temperature estimates and cores as massive as 150 Msun. We provide the raw source extraction catalogues and the source derived size, temperature, mass, and spectral indices in the 15 protoclusters.

 - **Abstract**
 We present follow-up spectroscopy and a detailed model atmosphere analysis of 29 wide double white dwarfs, including eight systems with a crystallized C/O core member. We use state-of-the-art evolutionary models to constrain the physical parameters of each star, including the total age. Assuming that the members of wide binaries are coeval, any age difference between the binary members can be used to test the cooling physics for white dwarf stars, including potential delays due to crystallization and $^{22}$Ne distillation. We use our control sample of 14 wide binaries with non-crystallized members to show that this method works well; the control sample shows an age difference of only $\Delta$Age = $-0.03 \pm$ 0.15 Gyr between its members. For the eight crystallized C/O core systems we find a cooling anomaly of $\Delta$Age= 1.13$^{+1.20}_{-1.07}$ Gyr. Even though our results are consistent with a small additional cooling delay ($\sim1$ Gyr) from $^{22}$Ne distillation and other neutron-rich impurities, the large uncertainties make this result not statistically significant. Nevertheless, we rule out cooling delays longer than 3.6 Gyr at the 99.7% ($3\sigma$) confidence level for 0.6-0.9 $M_{\odot}$ white dwarfs. Further progress requires larger samples of wide binaries with crystallized massive white dwarf members. We provide a list of subgiant + white dwarf binaries that could be used for this purpose in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 Following a glitch, a neutron star interior undergoes a transfer of angular momentum from the star's crust to the core, resulting in the spin-up of the latter. The crust-core coupling, which determines how quickly this spin-up proceeds, can be achieved through various physical processes, including Ekman pumping, superfluid vortex-mediated mutual friction, and magnetic fields. While the complexity of the problem has hindered studies of the mechanisms' combined action, analytical work on individual processes suggests different spin-up timescales depending on the relative strength of Coriolis, viscous, and mutual friction forces, and the magnetic field, respectively. However, experimental and numerical validations of these results are limited. In this paper, we focus on viscous effects and mutual friction and conduct non-linear hydrodynamical simulations of the spin-up problem in a two-component fluid by solving the incompressible Hall$-$Vinen$-$Bekarevich$-$Khalatnikov (HVBK) equations in the full sphere (i.e., including $r=0$) for the first time. We find that the viscous (normal) component accelerates due to Ekman pumping, although the mutual friction coupling to the superfluid component alters the spin-up dynamics compared to the single-fluid scenario. Close to the sphere's surface, the response of the superfluid is accurately described by the mutual friction timescale irrespective of its coupling strength with the normal component. However, as we move deeper into the sphere, the superfluid accelerates on different timescales due to the slow viscous spin-up of the internal normal fluid layers. We discuss potential implications for neutron stars and requirements for future work to build more realistic models.
