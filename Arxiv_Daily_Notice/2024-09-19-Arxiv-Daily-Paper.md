 - **Abstract**
 We identify a point-symmetric morphology of three pairs of ears/clumps in the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant (CCSNR) Puppis A, supporting the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). In the JJEM, the three pairs of jets that shaped the three pairs of ears/clumps in Puppis A are part of a large, about 10 to 30 pairs of jets that exploded Puppis A. Some similarities in morphological features between CCSNR Puppis A and three multipolar planetary nebulae considered to have been shaped by jets solidify the claim for shaping by jets. Puppis A has a prominent dipole structure, where one side is bright with a well-defined boundary, while the other is faint and defused. The neutron star (NS) remnant of Puppis A has a proper velocity, its natal kick velocity, in the opposite direction to the denser part of the dipole structure. We propose a new mechanism in the frame of the JJEM that imparts a natal kick to the NS, the kick-by-early asymmetrical pair (kick-BEAP) mechanism. At the early phase of the explosion process, the NS launches a pair of jets where one jet is much more energetic than the counter jet. The more energetic jet compresses a dense side to the CCSNR, and, by momentum conservation, the NS recoils in the opposite direction. Our study supports the JJEM as the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe and enriches this explosion mechanism by introducing the novel kick-BEAP mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the dark matter (DM) halos of a sample of dwarf Ellitpicals (dE) and discuss cosmological and evolutionary implications. Using orbit modeling we recover their density slopes and, for the first time, the halo flattening. We find the `cusp-core' tension is mild, on average dEs have central slopes slightly below the Navarro Frenk White (NFW) predictions. However, the measured flattenings are still more spherical than cosmological simulations predict. Unlike brighter ETGs the total density slopes of dEs are shallower, and their average DM density does not follow their scaling relation with luminosity. Conversely, dE halos are denser and the densities steeper than in LTGs. We find average DM density and slope are strongly correlated with the environment and moderately with the angular momentum. Central, non-rotating dEs have dense and cuspy halos, whereas rotating dEs in Virgo's outskirts are more cored and less dense. This can be explained by a delayed formation of the dEs in the cluster outskirts, or alternatively, by the accumulated baryonic feedback the dEs in the outskirts have experienced during their very different star formation history. Our results suggest halo profiles are not universal (they depend on assembly conditions) and they evolve only mildly due to internal feedback. We conclude dEs in the local Universe have assembled at a higher redshift than local spirals. In these extreme conditions (e.g. star-formation, halo assembly) were very different, suggesting no new dEs are formed at present.
#### Thermal Evolution of Lava Planets

 - **Abstract**
 Rocky planets are thought to form with a magma ocean that quickly solidifies. The horizontal and vertical extent of this magma ocean depends on the interior thermal evolution of the planet, and possibly exogenous processes such as planet migration. We present a model for simulating the thermal history of tidally locked lava planets. We initiate the model with a completely molten mantle and evolve it for ten billion years. We adopt a fixed surface temperature of 3000 K for the irradiated day-side, but allow the night-side temperature to evolve along with the underlying layers. We simulate planets of radius 1.0$R_{\oplus}$ and 1.5$R_{\oplus}$ with different core mass fractions, although the latter does not significantly impact the thermal evolution. We confirm that the day-side magma ocean on these planets has a depth that depends on the planetary radius. The night-side, on the other hand, begins crystallizing within a few thousand years and completely solidifies within 800 million years in the absence of substantial tidal heating or day-night heat transport. We show that a magma ocean can be sustained on the night-side of a lava planet if at least 20 per cent of absorbed stellar power is transmitted from the day-side to the night-side via magma currents. Such day-night transport could be sustained if the magma has a viscosity of $10^{-3}$ Pa s, which is plausible at these temperatures. Alternatively, the night-side could remain molten if the mush layer is tidally heated at the rate of $8 \times 10^{-4}$ W/kg of mush, which is plausible for orbital eccentricities of $e > 7 \times 10^{-3}$. Night-side cooling is a runaway process, however: the magma becomes more viscous and the mush solidifies, reducing both day-night heat transport and tidal heating. Measurements of the night-sides of lava planets are therefore a sensitive probe of the thermal history of these planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. The goal of this work is to comprehensively characterize the impact of stellar multiplicity on Class II disks in the L1641 and L1647 regions of Orion A (~1-3 Myr), part of the Survey of Orion Disks with ALMA (SODA). We characterize the protostellar multiplicity using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the ESO-VISTA, and Hubble Space telescopes. The resulting sample of 65 multiple systems represents the largest catalogue of wide binary systems to date (projected separation >1000 AU), allowing a more robust statistical characterization of the evolution and properties of protoplanetary disks. Methods. The disk population was observed in continuum with ALMA at 225 GHz, with a median rms of 1.5 Mearth. Combining these data (resolution ~1.1arcsec ) with the ESO-VISTA near-infrared survey of the Orion A cloud (resolution ~0.7arcsec ), multiple systems are assembled and selected by an iterative inside-out search in projected separation (>1000 AU). Results. We identify 61 binary systems, 3 triple systems, and one quadruple system. The separation range is between 1000 and 10^4 AU. The dust mass distributions inferred with the Kaplan-Meier estimator yield a median mass of 3.23+0.6-0.4 Mearth for primary disks and 3.88+0.3-0.3 Mearth for secondary disks.
#### Gravity or turbulence? VII. The Schmidt-Kennicutt law, the star formation efficiency, and the mass density of clusters from gravitational collapse rather than turbulent support

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the Schmidt-Kennicutt (SK) relations and the star formation efficiency per free-fall time ($\eff$), mirroring observational studies, in numerical simulations of filamentary molecular clouds undergoing gravitational contraction. We find that {\it a)} collapsing clouds accurately replicate the observed SK relations for galactic clouds and {\it b)} the so-called efficiency per free-fall time ($\eff$) is small and constant in space and in time, with values similar to those found in local clouds. This constancy is a consequence of the similar radial scaling of the free-fall time and the internal mass in density structures with spherically-averaged density profiles near $r^{-2}$. We additionally show that {\it c)} the star formation rate (SFR) increases rapidly in time; {\it d)} the low values of $\eff$ are due to the different time periods over which $\tauff$ and $\tausf$ are evaluated, together with the fast increasing SFR, and {\it e)} the fact that star clusters are significantly denser than the gas clumps from which they form is a natural consequence of the fast increasing SFR, the continuous replenishment of the star-forming gas by the accretion flow, and the near $r^{-2}$ density profile generated by the collapse Finally, we argue that the interpretation of $\eff$ as an efficiency is problematic because its maximum value is not bounded by unity, and because the total gas mass in the clouds is not fixed, but rather depends on the environment where clouds are embedded. In summary, our results show that the SK relation, the typical observed values of $\eff$, and the mass density of clusters arise as a natural consequence of gravitational contraction.
#### Long-term Evolutionary Links Between the Isolated Neutron Star Populations

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11595

 - **Abstract**
 We have investigated the evolutionary connections of the isolated neutron star (NS) populations including radio pulsars (RPs), anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs), soft gamma repeaters (SGRs), dim isolated NSs (XDINs), ``high-magnetic-field'' RPs (``HBRPs''), central compact objects (CCOs), rotating radio transients (RRATs), and long-period pulsars (LPPs) in the fallback disc model. The model can reproduce these NS families as a natural outcome of different initial conditions (initial period, disc mass, and dipole moment, $\mu$) with a continuous $\mu$ distribution in the $\sim 10^{27} - 5 \times 10^{30}$ G cm$^3$ range. Results of our simulations can be summarised as follows: (1) A fraction of ``HBRPs'' with relatively high $\mu$ evolve into the persistent AXP/SGR properties, and subsequently become LPPs. (2) Persistent AXP/SGRs do not have evolutionary links with CCOs, XDINs, and RRATs. (3) For a wide range of $\mu$, most RRATs evolve passing through RP or ``HBRP'' properties during their early evolutionary phases. (4) A fraction of RRATs which have the highest estimated birth rate seem to be the progenitors of XDINs. (5) LPPs, whose existence was predicted by the fallback disc model, are the sources evolving in the late stage of evolution before the discs become inactive. These results provide concrete support to the ideas proposing evolutionary connections between the NS families to account for the ``birth-rate problem'', the discrepancy between the cumulative birth rate estimated for these systems and the core-collapse supernova rate.

 - **Abstract**
 The tumultuous effects of ultraviolet photons that source cosmic reionization, the subsequent compression and shock-heating of low-density regions, and the modulation of baryons in shallow potential wells induced by the passage of ionization fronts, collectively introduce perturbations to the evolution of the intergalactic medium in the post-reionization era. These enduring fluctuations persist deep into the post-reionization era, casting a challenge upon precision cosmology endeavors targeting tracers in this cosmic era. Simultaneously, these relics from reionization also present a unique opportunity to glean insights into the astrophysics that govern the epoch of reionization. In this work, we propose a first study of the cross-correlation of \lya forest and 21 cm intensity mapping, accounting for the repercussions of inhomogeneous reionization in the post-reionization era. We investigate the ability of SKA $\times$ DESI-like, SKA $\times$ MUST-like, and PUMA $\times$ MUST-like instrumental setups to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the redshift range $3.5 \leq z \leq 4$. Moreover, we assess how alterations in integration time, survey area, and reionization scenarios impact the SNR. Furthermore, we forecast the cross-correlation's potential to constrain cosmological parameters under varying assumptions: considering or disregarding reionization relics, marginalizing over reionization astrophysics, and assuming perfect knowledge of reionization. Notably, our findings underscore the remarkable capability of a futuristic PUMA $\times$ MUST-like setup, with a modest 100-hour integration time over a 100 sq. deg. survey, to constrain the ionization efficiency error to $\sigma_\zeta = 3.42 $.

 - **Abstract**
 One way to understand planet formation is through studying the correlations between planet occurrence rates and stellar mass. However, measuring stellar mass in the red giant regime is very difficult. In particular, the spectroscopic masses of certain evolved stars, often referred to as "retired A-stars", have been questioned in the literature. Efforts to resolve this mass controversy using spectroscopy, interferometry and asteroseismology have so far been inconclusive. A recent ensemble study found a mass-dependent mass offset, but the result was based on only 16 stars. With NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we expand the investigation of the mass discrepancy to a total of 92 low-luminosity stars, synonymous with the retired A-stars. We measure their characteristic oscillation frequency, $\mathrm{\nu}_{\mathrm{max}}$, and the large frequency separation, $\mathrm{\Delta\nu}$, from their TESS photometric time series. Using these measurements and asteroseismic scaling relations, we derive asteroseismic masses and compare them with spectroscopic masses from five surveys, to comprehensively study the alleged mass-dependent mass offset. We find a mass offset between spectroscopy and seismology that increases with stellar mass. However, we note that adopting the seismic mass scale does not have a significant effect on the planet occurrence-mass-metallicity correlation for the so-called retired A-stars. We also report seismic measurements and masses for 157 higher luminosity giants (mostly helium-core-burning) from the spectroscopic surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The IBEX-Lo instrument on the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) mission observes primary and secondary interstellar helium in its 4 lowest energy steps. Observations of these helium populations have been systematically analyzed and compared to simulations using the analytic full integration of neutrals model (aFINM). A systematic difference is observed between the simulations and observations of secondary helium during solar cycle (SC) 24. We show that elastic scattering of primary helium by solar wind protons, which redistributes atoms from the core of the flux distribution, provides an explanation of the observed divergence from simulations. We verify that elastic scattering forms a halo in the wings of the primary He distribution in the spin-angle direction. Correcting the simulation for the effects of elastic scattering requires an increase of the estimated density of primary helium compared to previous estimates by Ulysses/GAS. Thus, based on our analysis of IBEX observations and $\chi ^2$ minimization of simulation data that include the effects of elastic scattering, any estimation of neutral interstellar helium density at 1 AU by direct detection of the peak flux of neutral helium needs to be adjusted by $~\sim$ 10%

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Mutual neutralization between cations and anions play an important role in determining the charge-balance in certain astrophysical environments. However, empirical data for such reactions involving complex molecular species has been lacking due to challenges in performing experimental studies, leaving the astronomical community to rely on decades old models with large uncertainties for describing these processes in the interstellar medium. Aims: To investigate the mutual neutralization (MN) reaction, C$_{60}^+$ + C$_{60}^-$ $\rightarrow$ C$_{60}^*$ + C$_{60}$, for collisions at interstellar-like conditions. Methods: The mutual neutralization reaction between C$_{60}^+$ and C$_{60}^-$ at collision energies of 100\,meV was studied using the Double ElectroStatic Ion Ring ExpEriment, DESIREE, and its merged-beam capabilities. To aid in the interpretation of the experimental results, semi-classical modeling based on the Landau-Zener approach was performed for the studied reaction. Results: We experimentally identify a narrow range of kinetic energies for the neutral reaction products. Modeling was used to calculate the quantum state-selective reaction probabilities, absolute cross sections, and rate coefficients of these MN reactions, using the experimental results as a benchmark. The MN cross sections are compared with model results for electron attachment to C$_{60}$ and electron recombination with C$_{60}^+$. Conclusions: The present results show that it is crucial to take mutual polarization effects, the finite sizes, and the final quantum states of both molecular ions into account for reliable predictions of MN rates expected to strongly influence the charge-balance and chemistry in, e.g., dense molecular clouds.
#### X-ray view of emission lines in optical spectra: Spectral analysis of the two low-mass X-ray binary systems Swift J1357.2-0933 and MAXI J1305-704

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a novel approach for determining the orbital inclination of low-mass X-ray binary systems by modelling the H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ line profiles emitted by the accretion disc, with a Newtonian version of diskline. We applied the model to two sample sources, Swift J1357.2-0933 and MAXI J1305-704, which are both transient black hole systems, and analyse two observations that were collected during a quiescent state and one observation of an outburst. The line profile is well described by the diskline model, although we had to add a Gaussian line to describe the deep inner core of the double-peaked profile, which the diskline model was unable to reproduce. The H$\beta$ emission lines in the spectrum of Swift J1357.2-0933 and the H$\alpha$ emission lines in that of MAXI J1305-704 during the quiescent state are consistent with a scenario in which these lines originate from a disc ring between $(9.6-57) \times 10^{3}, \rm{R_{g}}$ and $(1.94-20) \times 10^{4}, \rm{R_{g}}$, respectively. We estimate an inclination angle of $81 \pm 5$ degrees for Swift J1357.2-0933 and an angle of $73 \pm 4$ degrees for MAXI J1305-704. This is entirely consistent with the values reported in the literature. In agreement with the recent literature, our analysis of the outburst spectrum of MAXI J1305-704 revealed that the radius of the emission region deviates from expected values. This outcome implies several potential scenarios, including alternative disc configuration or even a circumbinary disc. We caution that these results were derived from a simplistic model that may not fully describe the complicated physics of accretion discs. Despite these limitations, our results for the inclination angles are remarkably consistent with recent complementary studies, and the proposed description of the emitting region remains entirely plausible.

 - **Abstract**
 Faraday rotation is an important probe of the magnetic fields and magnetized plasma around active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets. We present a Faraday rotation measure image of the M87 jet between 85.2 GHz and 101.3 GHz with a resolution of ~2" with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We found that the rotation measure (RM) of the M87 core is $\rm (4.5\pm 0.4)\times10^{4}\ rad\ m^{-2}$ with a low linear polarization fraction of $\rm (0.88\pm 0.08)\%$. The spatial RM gradient in the M87 jet spans a wide range from $\sim -2\times10^4\rm~rad\ m^{-2}$ to $\sim 3\times10^4\rm~rad\ m^{-2}$ with a typical uncertainty of $0.3\times10^4\rm~rad\ m^{-2}$. A comparison with previous RM measurements of the core suggests that the Faraday rotation of the core may originate very close to the super massive black hole (SMBH). Both an internal origin and an external screen with a rapidly varying emitting source could be possible. As for the jet, the RM gradient indicates a helical configuration of the magnetic field that persists up to kpc scale. Combined with the kpc-scale RM measurements at lower frequencies, we found that RM is frequency-dependent in the jet. One possible scenario to explain this dependence is that the kpc-scale jet has a trumpet-like shape and the jet coil unwinds near its end.
#### Multi-wavelength spectroscopic analysis of the ULX Holmberg II

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are high-mass X-ray binaries with an X-ray luminosity above $10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$. These ULXs can be powered by black holes that are more massive than $20M_\odot$, accreting in a standard regime, or lighter compact objects accreting supercritically. There are only a few ULXs with known optical or UV counterparts, and their nature is debated. Determining whether optical/UV radiation is produced by the donor star or by the accretion disc is crucial for understanding ULX physics and testing massive binary evolution. We conduct, for the first time, a fully consistent multi-wavelength spectral analysis of a ULX and its circumstellar nebula. We aim to establish the donor star type and test the presence of strong disc winds in the prototypical ULX Holmberg II X-1 (Ho II X-1). We intent to obtain a realistic spectral energy distribution of the ionising source, which is needed for robust nebula analysis. We acquired new UV spectra of Ho II X-1 with the HST and complemented them with archival optical and X-ray data. We explored the spectral energy distribution of the source and analysed the spectra using the stellar atmosphere code PoWR and the photoionisation code Cloudy. Our analysis of the X-ray, UV, and optical spectra of Ho II X-1 and its nebula consistently explains the observations. We do not find traces of disc wind signatures in the UV and the optical, rejecting previous claims of the ULX being a supercritical accretor. The optical/UV counterpart of HoII X-1 is explained by a B-type supergiant donor star. Thus, the observations are fully compatible with Ho II X-1 being a close binary consisting of an $\gtrsim 66\,M_\odot$ black hole accreting matter from an $\simeq 22 M_\odot$ B-supergiant companion. Also, we propose a possible evolution scenario for the system, suggesting that Ho II X-1 is a potential gravitational wave source progenitor.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce $\texttt{A}$strophysical $\texttt{H}$ybrid-$\texttt{K}$inetic simulations with the $\texttt{flASH}$ code ($\texttt{AHKASH}$) -- a new Hybrid particle-in-cell (PIC) code developed within the framework of the multi-physics code $\texttt{FLASH}$. The new code uses a second-order accurate Boris integrator and a predictor-predictor-corrector algorithm for advancing the Hybrid-kinetic equations, using the constraint transport method to ensure that magnetic fields are divergence-free. The code supports various interpolation schemes between the particles and grid cells, with post-interpolation smoothing to reduce finite particle noise. We further implement a $\delta f$ method to study instabilities in weakly collisional plasmas. The new code is tested on standard physical problems such as the motion of charged particles in uniform and spatially varying magnetic fields, the propagation of Alfvén and whistler waves, and Landau damping of ion acoustic waves. We test different interpolation kernels and demonstrate the necessity of performing post-interpolation smoothing. We couple the $\texttt{TurbGen}$ turbulence driving module to the new Hybrid PIC code, allowing us to test the code on the highly complex physical problem of the turbulent dynamo. To investigate steady-state turbulence with a fixed sonic Mach number, it is important to maintain isothermal plasma conditions. Therefore, we introduce a novel cooling method for Hybrid PIC codes and provide tests and calibrations of this method to keep the plasma isothermal. We describe and test the `hybrid precision' method, which significantly reduces (by a factor $\sim1.5$) the computational cost, without compromising the accuracy of the numerical solutions. Finally, we test the parallel scalability of the new code, showing excellent scaling up to 10,000~cores.
#### Disruption of a massive molecular cloud by a supernova in the Galactic Centre: Initial results from the ACES project

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our local solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions it exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong dynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar). Consequently, it is likely that there are large-scale physical structures within the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we present new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a multi-wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring-like morphology. We estimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring to be 79" and 154", respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre distance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $> 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, a mass of $\sim$ $10^6$ M$_\odot$, and an expansion speed of $\sim$ 20 km s$^{-1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($> 10^{51}$ erg) and momentum ($> 10^7$ M$_\odot$ km s$^{-1}$). We discuss several possible causes for the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback and large-scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring is a single high-energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain the observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have taken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which we now see as the M0.8$-$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an extreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.
