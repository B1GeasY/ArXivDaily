 - **Abstract**
 We present VLT/MUSE Narrow Field Mode (NFM) observations of a pair of disc-bearing young stellar objects towards the Orion Bar: 203-504 and 203-506. Both of these discs are subject to external photoevaporation, where winds are launched from their outer regions due to environmental irradiation. Intriguingly, despite having projected separation from one another of only 1.65{\arcsec} (660au at 400pc), 203-504 has a classic teardrop shaped ``proplyd'' morphology pointing towards $\theta^2$Ori A (indicating irradiation by the EUV of that star, rather than $\theta^1$ Ori C) but 203-506 has no ionisation front, indicating it is not irradiated by stellar EUV at all. However, 203-506 does show [CI] 8727{\AA} and [OI] 6300{\AA} in emission, indicating irradiation by stellar FUV. This explicitly demonstrates the importance of FUV irradiation in driving mass loss from discs. We conclude that shielding of 203-506 from EUV is most likely due to its position on the observers side of an ionized layer lying in the foreground of the Huygens Region. We demonstrate that the outflow HH 519, previously thought to be emanating from 203-504 is actually an irradiated cloud edge and identify a new compact outflow from that object approximately along our line of sight with a velocity $\sim130$\,km\,s$^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to detect a wide variety of gravitational wave sources in the mHz band. Some of these signals will elude individual detection, instead contributing as confusion noise to one of several stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds (SGWBs) -- notably including the `Galactic foreground', a loud signal resulting from the superposition of millions of unresolved double white dwarf binaries (DWDs) in the Milky Way. It is possible that similar, weaker SGWBs will be detectable from other DWD populations in the local universe, including the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We use the Bayesian LISA Inference Package ($\tt{BLIP}$) to evaluate the detectability by LISA of an anisotropic SGWB generated by unresolved DWDs in the LMC. To do so, we simulate the LMC SGWB from a realistic DWD population generated via binary population synthesis, simulate four years of time-domain data with $\tt{BLIP}$ comprised of stochastic contributions from the LMC SGWB and the LISA detector noise, and analyze this data with $\tt{BLIP}$'s spherical harmonic anisotropic SGWB search. We present results of this analysis and show that the SGWB from DWDs in the LMC is potentially detectable by LISA.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of ground-based and JWST observations of SN 2022pul, a peculiar "03fg-like" (or "super-Chandrasekhar") Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), in the nebular phase at 338 d post explosion. Our combined spectrum continuously covers 0.4-14 $\mu$m and includes the first mid-infrared spectrum of an 03fg-like SN Ia. Compared to normal SN Ia 2021aefx, SN 2022pul exhibits a lower mean ionization state, asymmetric emission-line profiles, stronger emission from the intermediate-mass elements (IMEs) argon and calcium, weaker emission from iron-group elements (IGEs), and the first unambiguous detection of neon in a SN Ia. Strong, broad, centrally peaked [Ne II] at 12.81 $\mu$m was previously predicted as a hallmark of "violent merger'' SN Ia models, where dynamical interaction between two sub-$M_{\text{Ch}}$ white dwarfs (WDs) causes disruption of the lower mass WD and detonation of the other. The violent merger scenario was already a leading hypothesis for 03fg-like SNe Ia; in SN 2022pul it can explain the large-scale ejecta asymmetries seen between the IMEs and IGEs and the central location of narrow oxygen and broad neon. We modify extant models to add clumping of the central ejecta to better reproduce the optical iron emission, and add mass in the innermost region ($< 2000$ km s$^{-1}$) to account for the observed narrow [O I] $\lambda\lambda6300$, 6364 emission. A violent WD-WD merger explains many of the observations of SN 2022pul, and our results favor this model interpretation for the subclass of 03fg-like SN Ia.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiation feedback from massive population III stars may have given rise to low mass star formation from primordial or nearly primordial material. If early universe low mass stars did form, some should remain locally as white dwarfs, sub-giants, or main sequence stars. In this paper, we present model calculations for the evolution of single 0.8 Msun to 3.0 Msun stars with primordial metallicity from pre-main sequence to the white dwarf cooling track, and calculations for the evolution of single 4.0 Msun to 7.0 Msun stars which conclude in the giant phase. One goal of this work is to identify potential observable markers for potential observed progenitors of first or nearly first stars. We uncover a number of seemingly peculiar evolutionary differences between that of pop III low mass stars compared with younger higher Z stars, as well as compared to other primordial evolution models. We also present an initial-final mass relationship and identify the minimum mass of a single white dwarf that could have had a population III progenitor.

 - **Abstract**
 Optical spectroscopy offers the most direct view of the stellar properties and the accretion indicators. Standard accretion tracers, such as $H\beta$, $H\alpha$, and, Ca II triplet lines, and most photospheric features, fall in the optical wavelengths. However, these tracers are not readily observable from deeply embedded protostars because of the large line of sight extinction (Av $\sim$ 50-100 mag) toward them. In some cases, however, it is possible to observe protostars at optical wavelengths if the outflow cavity is aligned along the line-of-sight that allows observations of the photosphere, or the envelope is very tenuous and thin such that the extinction is low. In such cases, we can not only detect these protostars at optical wavelengths but also follow up spectroscopically. We have used the HOPS catalog (Furlan et al. 2016) of protostars in Orion to search for optical counterparts for protostars in the Gaia DR3 survey. Out of the 330 protostars in the HOPS sample, an optical counterpart within 2" is detected for 62 of the protostars. For 17 out of 62 optically detected protostars, we obtained optical spectra { (between 5500 to 8900 $\AA$) using the Aries-Devasthal Faint Object Spectrograph \& Camera (ADFOSC) on the 3.6-m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT) and Hanle Faint Object Spectrograph Camera (HFOSC) on 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT)}. We detect strong photospheric features, such as the TiO bands in the spectra {(of 4 protostars)}, hinting that photospheres can form early on in the star formation process. We further determined the spectral types of protostars, which show photospheres similar to a late M-type. Mass accretion rates derived for the protostars are similar to those found for T-Tauri stars, in the range of 10$^{-7}$ to 10$^{-8}$ $M_\odot$/yr.
#### Partially-ionised two-fluid shocks with collisional and radiative  ionisation and recombination -- multi-level hydrogen model

 - **Abstract**
 Explosive phenomena are known to trigger a wealth of shocks in warm plasma environments, including the solar chromosphere and molecular clouds where the medium consists of both ionised and neutral species. Partial ionisation is critical in determining the behaviour of shocks, since the ions and neutrals locally decouple, allowing for substructure to exist within the shock. Accurately modelling partially ionised shocks requires careful treatment of the ionised and neutral species, and their interactions. Here we study a partially-ionised switch-off slow-mode shock using a multi-level hydrogen model with both collisional and radiative ionisation and recombination rates that are implemented into the two-fluid (P\underline{I}P) code, and study physical parameters that are typical of the solar chromosphere. The multi-level hydrogen model differs significantly from MHD solutions due to the macroscopic thermal energy loss during collisional ionisation. In particular, the plasma temperature both post-shock and within the finite-width is significantly cooler that the post-shock MHD temperature. Furthermore, in the mid to lower chromosphere, shocks feature far greater compression then their single-fluid MHD analogues. The decreased temperature and increased compression reveal the importance of non-equilibrium ionised in the thermal evolution of shocks in partially ionised media. Since partially ionised shocks are not accurately described by the Rankine-Hugoniot shock jump conditions, it may be incorrect to use these to infer properties of lower atmospheric shocks.

 - **Abstract**
 Pre-stellar cores represent a critical evolutionary phase in low-mass star formation. We aim to unveil the detailed thermal structure and density distribution of three early-stage cores, starless core L1517B, and prestellar core L694-2 and L429, with the high angular resolution observations of the NH$_{3}$ (1,1) and (2,2) inversion transitions obtained with VLA and GBT. In addition, we explore where/if NH$_{3}$ depletes in the central regions. Applying the mid-infrared extinction method to the $\textit{Spitzer}$ 8$~\mu$m map we obtain a high angular resolution hydrogen column density map, and derive the gas density profile to assess the variation of NH$_{3}$ abundance as a function of gas volume density. The measured temperature profiles of L429 and L1517B show a minor decrease towards the core center, dropping from $\sim$9\~K to below 8\~K, and $\sim$11 K to 10 K, while L694-2 has a rather uniform temperature distribution around $\sim$9 K. Among the three cores, L429 has the highest central gas density, close to sonic velocity line-width, and largest localised velocity gradient, all indicative of an advanced evolutionary stage. We resolve that the abundance of NH$_{3}$ becomes two times lower in the central region of L429, occurring around a gas density of 4.4$\times$10$^{4}$$~cm^{-3}$. Compared to Ophiuchus/H-MM1 which shows an even stronger drop of the NH$_{3}$ abundance at 2$\times$10$^{5}$$~cm^{-3}$, the abundance variations of the three cores plus Ophiuchus/H-MM1 suggest a progressive NH$_{3}$ depletion with increasing central density of the core.

 - **Abstract**
 Previous observations of dark vortices in Neptune's atmosphere, such as Voyager-2's Great Dark Spot, have been made in only a few, broad-wavelength channels, which has hampered efforts to pinpoint their pressure level and what makes them dark. Here, we present Very Large Telescope (Chile) MUSE spectrometer observations of Hubble Space Telescope's NDS-2018 dark spot, made in 2019. These medium-resolution 475 - 933 nm reflection spectra allow us to show that dark spots are caused by a darkening at short wavelengths (< 700 nm) of a deep ~5-bar aerosol layer, which we suggest is the H$_2$S condensation layer. A deep bright spot, named DBS-2019, is also visible on the edge of NDS-2018, whose spectral signature is consistent with a brightening of the same 5-bar layer at longer wavelengths (> 700 nm). This bright feature is much deeper than previously studied dark spot companion clouds and may be connected with the circulation that generates and sustains such spots.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent discoveries of gas giant exoplanets around M-dwarfs (GEMS) from transiting and radial velocity (RV) surveys are difficult to explain with core-accretion models. We present here a homogeneous suite of 162 models of gravitationally unstable gaseous disks. These models represent an existence proof for gas giants more massive than 0.1 Jupiter masses to form by the gas disk gravitational instability (GDGI) mechanism around M-dwarfs for comparison with observed exoplanet demographics and protoplanetary disk mass estimates for M-dwarf stars. We use the Enzo 2.6 adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) 3D hydrodynamics code to follow the formation and initial orbital evolution of gas giant protoplanets in gravitationally unstable gaseous disks in orbit around M-dwarfs with stellar masses ranging from 0.1 $M_\odot$ to 0.5 $M_\odot$. The gas disk masses are varied over a range from disks that are too low in mass to form gas giants rapidly to those where numerous gas giants are formed, therefore revealing the critical disk mass necessary for gas giants to form by the GDGI mechanism around M-dwarfs. The disk masses vary from 0.01 $M_\odot$ to 0.05 $M_\odot$ while the disk to star mass ratios explored range from 0.04 to 0.3. The models have varied initial outer disk temperatures (10 K to 60 K) and varied levels of AMR grid spatial resolution, producing a sample of expected gas giant protoplanets for each star mass. Broadly speaking, disk masses of at least 0.02 $M_\odot$ are needed for the GDGI mechanism to form gas giant protoplanets around M-dwarfs.
#### Tracing Dense Gas in Six Resolved GMCs of the Andromeda Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 We present dense-gas--tracing molecular observations of six resolved Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). Using the NOEMA interferometer, we observed the transitions of HCN(1-0), HCO$^+$(1-0), and HNC(1-0), as well as $^{13}$CO(1-0) and 100 GHz continuum emission. This complements our earlier work with the Submillimeter Array (SMA), including resolved dust continuum detections of these clouds at 230 GHz. In this work, we first compare different continuum measurements to conclude that the average free-free contamination of the observed flux is 71% at 3 mm but only 13% at 1 mm, confirming that emission at 3 mm is less reliable than that at 1 mm for calculating dust masses of star-forming clouds. While the $^{13}$CO emission is more extended than both HCN and HCO$^+$ emission, which in turn is more extended than HNC emission, we find that both HCN and HCO$^+$ are spatially coincident with, and similarly extended as, the 230 GHz dust emission. This suggests that both the 230 GHz dust continuum and most importantly the HCN emission traces the dense gas component of these GMCs. From comparison of the molecular emission with dust masses derived from the 230 GHz continuum emission, we obtain the first direct measurements of the dust-mass-to-light ratios ($\alpha^\prime_{HCN}$ and $\alpha^\prime_{HCO^+}$) in GMCs of an external galaxy. For HCN, the result is broadly similar to a measurement in the local Perseus cloud suggesting that these are indeed dense gas conversion factors. A larger cloud sample will be required to assess whether HCN is tracing comparable cloud-scale density regimes across the environments of M31.
