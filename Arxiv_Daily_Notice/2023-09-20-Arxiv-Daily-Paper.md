#### Atmospheric Retrieval of L Dwarfs: Benchmarking Results and  Characterizing the Young Planetary Mass Companion HD 106906 b in the  Near-Infrared

 - **Abstract**
 We present model constraints on the atmospheric structure of HD 106906 b, a planetary-mass companion orbiting at a ~700 AU projected separation around a 15 Myr-old stellar binary, using the APOLLO retrieval code on spectral data spanning 1.1-2.5 $\mu$m. C/O ratios can provide evidence for companion formation pathways, as such pathways are ambiguous both at wide separations and at star-to-companion mass ratios in the overlap between the distributions of planets and brown dwarfs. We benchmark our code against an existing retrieval of the field L dwarf 2M2224-0158, returning a C/O ratio consistent with previous fits to the same JHKs data, but disagreeing in the thermal structure, cloud properties, and atmospheric scale height. For HD 106906 b, we retrieve C/O $=0.53^{+0.15}_{-0.25}$, consistent with the C/O ratios expected for HD 106906's stellar association and therefore consistent with a stellar-like formation for the companion. We find abundances of H$_2$O and CO near chemical equilibrium values for a solar metallicity, but a surface gravity lower than expected, as well as a thermal profile with sharp transitions in the temperature gradient. Despite high signal-to-noise and spectral resolution, more accurate constraints necessitate data across a broader wavelength range. This work serves as preparation for subsequent retrievals in the era of JWST, as JWST's spectral range provides a promising opportunity to resolve difficulties in fitting low-gravity L dwarfs, and also underscores the need for simultaneous comparative retrievals on L dwarf companions with multiple retrieval codes.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results of a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UBVI-band study of star clusters in tidal tails, using new WFC3 and ACS imaging to complement existing WFPC2 data. We survey 12 tidal tails across seven merging systems, deriving ages and masses for 425 star cluster candidates (SCCs). The stacked mass distribution across all systems follows a power law of the form $dN/dM \propto M^{\beta}$, with $\beta = -2.02 \pm 0.15$, consistent with what is seen in other star forming environments. GALEX and Swift UV imaging provide star formation rates (SFRs) for our tidal tails, which when compared with ages and masses of our SCCs, allows for a determination of the cluster formation efficiency (CFE). We find the CFE increases with increasing SFR surface density, matching the theoretical model. We confirm this fit down at SFR densities lower than previously measured (log $\Sigma_\text{SFR} \: (\text{M}_\odot \: \text{yr}^{-1} \: \text{kpc}^{-2}) \approx -4.2$), as related to the CFE. We determine the half-light radii for a refined sample of 57 SCCs with our HST WFC3 and ACS imaging, and calculate their dynamical age, finding the majority of them to be gravitationally bound. We also provide evidence of only low-mass ($< 10^4 \: \text{M}_\odot$) cluster formation in our nearest galaxy, NGC 1487, consistent with the theory that this system is a dwarf merger.

 - **Abstract**
 The CH$_3$O and CH$_2$OH radicals can be important precursors of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar dust. The COMs presumably originating from these radicals were abundantly found in various astronomical objects. Because each radical leads to different types of COMs, determining the abundance ratio of CH$_3$O to CH$_2$OH is crucial for a better understanding of the chemical evolution to various COMs. Recent work suggested that the reaction between CH$_3$OH and OH on ice dust plays an important role in forming CH$_3$O and CH$_2$OH radicals. However, quantitative details on the abundance of these radicals have not been presented to date. Herein, we experimentally determined the branching ratio (CH$_3$O/CH$_2$OH) resulting from the CH$_3$OH + OH reaction on the water ice surface at 10 K to be 4.3 $\pm$ 0.6. Furthermore, the CH$_3$O product in the reaction would participate in subsequent diffusive reactions even at a temperature as low as 10 K. This fact should provide critical information for COMs formation models in cold molecular clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new JVLA and VLBA observations tracing the HI in the central region of 3C84 (Perseus A). This radio source is hosted by the bright cluster galaxy NGC 1275 in the centre of the iconic Perseus cluster. With the JVLA, we detected broad (FWHM~500 km/s) HI absorption at arcsecond resolution (~300 pc) centred at the systemic velocity of NGC 1275 against the bright radio continuum, suggesting that the detected gas is very close to the supermassive black hole (SMBH). However, we did not detect any absorption in the higher-resolution VLBA data against the parsec-scale radio core and jet. Based on a comparison of the properties of the HI absorption with those of the molecular circum-nuclear disc (CND) known to be present in NGC 1275, we argue that the HI seen in absorption arises from HI in this fast-rotating CND, and that neutral atomic hydrogen is present as close as ~20 pc from the SMBH. The radio continuum providing the background for absorption arises from non-thermal synchrotron emission from the star formation activity in the CND, whose presence has been reported by earlier VLBA studies. We did not detect any signature that the HI gas is affected by an interaction with the radio jet. Thus, at this stage of the evolution of the source, the impact of the radio jet on the gas in NGC 1275 mainly creates cavities on much larger galaxy scales. Overall, the properties of the CND in Perseus A present strong similarities with Mrk 231, suggesting that, unlike often assumed, HI absorption can arise against the radio emission from star formation in a CND. With the JVLA, we serendipitously detected a new, faint absorbing system that is redshifted by ~2660 km/s, in addition to the already known high-velocity absorption system that is redshifted 2850 km/s with respect to NGC 1275. We identify this new system as gas that is stripped from a foreground galaxy falling into the Perseus cluster.
#### JOYS: Disentangling the warm and cold material in the high-mass IRAS  23385+6053 cluster

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) We study and compare the warm (>100 K) and cold (<100 K) material toward the high-mass star-forming region IRAS 23385+6053 (IRAS 23385 hereafter) combining high angular resolution observations in the mid-infrared (MIR) with the JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS) project and with the NOEMA at mm wavelengths at angular resolutions of 0.2"-1". The spatial morphology of atomic and molecular species is investigated by line integrated intensity maps. The temperature and column density of different gas components is estimated using H2 transitions (warm and hot component) and a series of CH3CN transitions as well as 3 mm continuum emission (cold component). Toward the central dense core in IRAS 23385 the material consists of relatively cold gas and dust (~50 K), while multiple outflows create heated and/or shocked H2 and show enhanced temperatures (~400 K) along the outflow structures. An energetic outflow with enhanced emission knots of [Fe II] and [Ni II] hints at J-type shocks, while two other outflows have enhanced emission of only H2 and [S I] caused by C-type shocks. The latter two outflows are also more prominent in molecular line emission at mm wavelengths (e.g., SiO, SO, H2CO, and CH3OH). Even higher angular resolution data are needed to unambiguously identify the outflow driving sources given the clustered nature of IRAS 23385. While most of the forbidden fine structure transitions are blueshifted, [Ne II] and [Ne III] peak at the source velocity toward the MIR source A/mmA2 suggesting that the emission is originating from closer to the protostar.
#### To clump or not to clump The impact of wind inhomogeneities on the  optical and NIR spectroscopic analysis of massive OB stars

 - **Abstract**
 Winds of massive stars have density inhomogeneities (clumping) that may affect the formation of spectral lines in different ways, depending on their formation region. Most of previous and current spectroscopic analyses have been performed in the optical or ultraviolet domain. However, massive stars are often hidden behind dense clouds rendering near-infrared observations necessary. Our objective is to investigate whether a spectroscopic analysis using either optical or infrared observations results in the same stellar parameters with comparable accuracy, and whether clumping affects them in different ways. We analyzed optical and near-infrared observations of a set of massive O stars with spectral types O4-O9.5 and all luminosity classes. We obtain similar stellar parameters in the optical and the infrared, although with larger uncertainties in the near-infrared, both with and without clumping, albeit with some individual deviating cases. We find that the inclusion of clumping improves the fit to H$_\alpha$ or HeII 4686 in the optical for supergiants, as well as that of Br$_\gamma$ in the near-infrared, but it sometimes worsens the fit to HeII 2.18$\mu$m. Globally, there are no significant differences when using the clumping laws tested in this work. The infrared can be used for spectroscopic analyses, giving similar parameters as from the optical, though with larger uncertainties. The best fits to different lines are obtained with different (linear) clumping laws, indicating that the wind structure may be more complex than adopted in the present work. No clumping law results in a better global fit, or improves the consistency between optical and infrared stellar parameters. Our work shows that the optical and infrared lines are not sufficient to break the dichotomy between the mass-loss rate and clumping factor.
#### Collisional heating of icy planetesimals. I. Catastrophic collisions

 - **Abstract**
 Planetesimals in the primordial disc may have experienced a collisional cascade. If so, the comet nuclei later placed in the Kuiper belt, scattered disc, and Oort Cloud would primarily be fragments and collisional rubble piles from that cascade. However, the heating associated with the collisions cannot have been strong enough to remove the hypervolatiles that are trapped within more durable ices, because comet nuclei are rich in hypervolatiles. This places constraints on the diameter of the largest bodies allowed to participate in collisional cascades, and limits the primordial disc lifetime or population size. In this paper, the thermophysical code NIMBUS is used to study the thermal evolution of planetesimals before, during, and after catastrophic collisions. The loss of CO during segregation of $\mathrm{CO_2:CO}$ mixtures and during crystallisation of amorphous $\mathrm{H_2O}$ is calculated, as well as mobilisation and internal relocation of $\mathrm{CO_2}$. If an amorphous $\mathrm{H_2O}$ host existed, and was protected by a $\mathrm{CO_2:CO}$ heat sink, only diameter $D<20\,\mathrm{km}$ (inner disc) and $D<64\,\mathrm{km}$ (outer disc) bodies could have been involved in a collisional cascade. If $\mathrm{CO_2}$ was the only CO host, the critical diameters drop to $D<20$-$32\mathrm{km}$. Avoiding disruption of larger bodies requires a primordial disc lifetime of $<9\,\mathrm{Myr}$ at $15\,\mathrm{au}$ and $<50$-$70\,\mathrm{Myr}$ at $30\,\mathrm{au}$. Alternatively, if a $450\,\mathrm{Myr}$ disc lifetime is required to associate the primordial disc disruption with the Late Heavy Bombardment, the disc population size must have been 6-60 times below current estimates.

 - **Abstract**
 Formed at an early stage of gas-phase ion-molecule chemistry, hydrides -- molecules containing a heavy element covalently bonded to one or more hydrogen atoms -- play an important role in interstellar chemistry as they are the progenitors of larger and more complex species in the interstellar medium. In recent years, the careful analysis of the spectral signatures of hydrides have led to their use as tracers of different constituents, and phases of the interstellar medium and in particular the more diffuse environments. Diffuse clouds form an essential link in the stellar gas life-cycle as they connect both the late and early stages of stellar evolution. As a result, diffuse clouds are continuously replenished by material which makes them reservoirs for heavy elements and hence ideal laboratories for the study of astrochemistry. This review will journey through a renaissance of hydride observations detailing puzzling hydride discoveries and chemical mysteries with special focus carbon-bearing hydrides to demonstrate the big impact of these small molecules and ending with remarks on the future of their studies.
#### A new method for spatially resolving the turbulence driving mixture in  the ISM with application to the Small Magellanic Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulence plays a crucial role in shaping the structure of the interstellar medium. The ratio of the three-dimensional density contrast ($\sigma_{\rho/\rho_0}$) to the turbulent sonic Mach number ($\mathcal{M}$) of an isothermal, compressible gas describes the ratio of solenoidal to compressive modes in the turbulent acceleration field of the gas, and is parameterised by the turbulence driving parameter: $b=\sigma_{\rho/\rho_0}/\mathcal{M}$. The turbulence driving parameter ranges from $b=1/3$ (purely solenoidal) to $b=1$ (purely compressive), with $b=0.38$ characterising the natural mixture (1/3~compressive, 2/3~solenoidal) of the two driving modes. Here we present a new method for recovering $\sigma_{\rho/\rho_0}$, $\mathcal{M}$, and $b$, from observations on galactic scales, using a roving kernel to produce maps of these quantities from column density and centroid velocity maps. We apply our method to high-resolution HI emission observations of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) from the GASKAP-HI survey. We find that the turbulence driving parameter varies between $b\sim 0.3$ and $b\sim 1.0$ within the main body of the SMC, but the median value converges to $b\sim0.51$, suggesting that the turbulence is overall driven more compressively ($b>0.38$). We observe no correlation between the $b$ parameter and HI or H$\alpha$ intensity, indicating that compressive driving of HI turbulence cannot be determined solely by observing HI or H$\alpha$ emission density, and that velocity information must also be considered. Further investigation is required to link our findings to potential driving mechanisms such as star-formation feedback, gravitational collapse, or cloud-cloud collisions.
#### Thorne-Żytkow objects with mirror neutron star cores?

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.10769
 - **Abstract**
 A Thorne-\.{Z}ytkow object can be formed when a neutron star is absorbed by the envelope of its giant companion star, spirals toward the center of the giant star due to the drag from the surrounding envelope, and merges with the star's core. During in-spiral, dynamical friction is the main drag force acting on a neutron star inside the star envelope. However, dynamical friction is caused by the neutron star's gravitational interaction with its own gravitationally induced wake. Therefore, exactly the same gravitational drag force will act on a mirror neutron star, and if a significant part of the dark matter is in the form of mirror matter, then we expect the formation of Thorne-\.{Z}ytkow objects with a mirror neutron star inside.
#### Chemical abundances of the young inner-disk open cluster NGC 6705  observed by APOGEE: sodium-rich and not $α$-enhanced

 - **Abstract**
 Previous results in the literature have found the young inner-disk open cluster NGC 6705 to be mildly $\alpha$-enhanced. We examined this possibility via an independent chemical abundance analysis for 11 red-giant members of NGC 6705. The analysis is based on near-infrared APOGEE spectra and relies on LTE calculations using spherical model atmospheres and radiative transfer. We find a mean cluster metallicity of $\rm [Fe/H] = +0.13 \pm 0.04$, indicating that NGC 6705 is metal-rich, as may be expected for a young inner-disk cluster. The mean $\alpha$-element abundance relative to iron is $\rm \langle [\alpha/Fe]\rangle =-0.03 \pm 0.05$, which is not at odds with expectations from general Galactic abundance trends. NGC 6705 also provides important probes for studying stellar mixing, given its turn-off mass of M$\sim$3.3 M$_\odot$. Its red giants have low $^{12}$C abundances ([$^{12}$C/Fe]=$-$0.16) and enhanced $^{14}$N abundances ([$^{14}$N/Fe]=+0.51), which are key signatures of the first dredge-up on the red giant branch. An additional signature of dredge-up was found in the Na abundances, which are enhanced by [Na/Fe]=+0.29, with a very small non-LTE correction. The $^{16}$O and Al abundances are found to be near-solar. All of the derived mixing-sensitive abundances are in agreement with stellar models of approximately 3.3 M$_{\odot}$ evolving along the red giant branch and onto the red clump. As found in young open clusters with similar metallicities, NGC 6705 exhibits a mild excess in the s-process element cerium, with $\rm [Ce/Fe] = +0.13\pm0.07$.
#### Probing the spatial and velocity anisotropies in stellar halos from the  Aquarius simulations

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.10798
 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the spatial anisotropy and the velocity anisotropy in a set of mock stellar halos from the Aquarius simulations. The spatial anisotropy in each mock stellar halo rises progressively with the increasing distance from the halo centre, eventually reaching a maximum near the periphery. Excluding the bound satellites leads to a significant reduction of the spatial anisotropy in each halo. We compare the measured anisotropy in the mock stellar halos with that from their sphericalized versions where all the shape and substructure induced anisotropies are erased. The growth of spatial anisotropy persists throughout the entire halo when the bound satellites are present but remains limited within the inner halo ($<60 \, h^{-1}\, {\rm kpc}$) after their exclusion. This indicates that the spatial anisotropy in the inner halo is induced by the diffuse substructures and the halo shape whereas the outer halo anisotropy is dominated by the bound satellites. We find that the outer parts of the stellar halo are kinematically colder than the inner regions. The stellar orbits are predominantly radial but they become rotationally dominated at certain radii that are marked by the prominent $\beta$ dips. Most of the $\beta$ dips disappear after the removal of the satellites. A few shallow and broad $\beta$ dips arise occasionally due to the presence of diffuse streams and clouds. Our analysis suggests that a combined study of the spatial and velocity anisotropies can reveal the structure and the assembly history of the stellar halos.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray polarization is a powerful tool to investigate the geometry of accreting material around black holes, allowing independent measurements of the black hole spin and orientation of the innermost parts of the accretion disk. We perform the X-ray spectro-polarimetric analysis of an X-ray binary system in the Large Magellanic Cloud, LMC X-3, that hosts a stellar-mass black hole, known to be persistently accreting since its discovery. We report the first detection of the X-ray polarization in LMC X-3 with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer, and find the average polarization degree of 3.2% +- 0.6% and a constant polarization angle -42 deg +- 6 deg over the 2-8 keV range. Using accompanying spectroscopic observations by NICER, NuSTAR, and the Neil Gehrels Swift observatories, we confirm previous measurements of the black hole spin via the X-ray continuum method, a ~ 0.2. From polarization analysis only, we found consistent results with low black-hole spin, with an upper limit of a < 0.7 at a 90% confidence level. A slight increase of the polarization degree with energy, similar to other black-hole X-ray binaries in the soft state, is suggested from the data but with a low statistical significance.
