 - **Abstract**
 Recent detections of gravitational waves from mergers of binary black holes (BBHs) with pre-merger source-frame individual masses in the so-called upper mass-gap, expected due to (pulsational) pair instability supernova ((P)PISN), have created immense interest in the astrophysical production of high-mass black holes (BHs). Previous studies show that high-mass BHs may be produced via repeated BBH mergers inside dense star clusters. Alternatively, inside dense star clusters, stars with unusually low core-to-envelope mass ratios can form via mergers of high-mass stars, which then can avoid (P)PISN, but produce high-mass BHs via mass fallback. We simulate detailed star-by-star multi-physics models of dense star clusters using the Monte Carlo cluster evolution code, CMC, to investigate the role of primordial binary fraction among high-mass stars (>=15 Msun) on the formation of high-mass BHs. We vary the high-mass stellar binary fraction (fb_15_prime) while keeping all other initial properties, including the population of high-mass stars, unchanged. We find that the number of high-mass BHs, as well as the mass of the most massive BH formed via stellar core-collapse are proportional to fb_15_prime. In contrast, there is no correlation between fb_15_prime and the number of high-mass BHs formed via BH-BH mergers. Since the total production of high-mass BHs is dominated by BH-BH mergers in old clusters, the overall number of high-mass BHs produced over the typical lifetime of globular clusters is insensitive to fb_15_prime. Furthermore, we study the differences in the demographics of BH-BH mergers as a function of fb_15_prime.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars form in dense cores within molecular clouds and newly formed stars influence their natal environments. How stellar feedback impacts core properties and evolution is subject to extensive investigation. We performed a hierarchical clustering (dendrogram) analysis of a STARFORGE simulation modelling a giant molecular cloud to identify gas overdensities (cores) and study changes in their radius, mass, velocity dispersion, and virial parameter with respect to stellar feedback. We binned these cores on the basis of the fraction of gas affected by protostellar outflows, stellar winds, and supernovae and analysed the property distributions for each feedback bin. We find that cores that experience more feedback influence are smaller. Feedback notably enhances the velocity dispersion and virial parameter of the cores, more so than it reduces their radius. This is also evident in the linewidth-size relation, where cores in higher feedback bins exhibit higher velocities than their similarly sized pristine counterparts. We conclude that stellar feedback mechanisms, which impart momentum to the molecular cloud, simultaneously compress and disperse the dense molecular gas.
#### The Role of Thermal Feedback in the Growth of Planetary Cores by Pebble Accretion in Dust Traps

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution millimetre-imaging of protoplanetary discs has revealed many containing rings and gaps. These rings can contain large quantities of dust, often in excess of 10M$_\oplus$, providing prime sites for efficient and rapid planet formation. Rapid planet formation will produce high accretion luminosities, heating the surrounding disc. We investigate the importance of a planetary embryo's accretion luminosity by simulating the dynamics of the gas and dust in a dust ring, accounting for the energy liberated as a resident planetary embryo accretes. The resulting heating alters the flow structure near the planet, increasing the accretion rate of large, millimetre-to-centimetre-sized dust grains. We show how this process varies with the mass of dust in the ring and the local background gas temperature, demonstrating that the thermal feedback always acts to increase the planet's mass. This increase in planet mass is driven primarily by the formation of vortices, created by a baroclinic instability once the accreting planet heats the disc significantly outside its Hill radius. The vortices can then migrate with respect to the planet, resulting in a complex interplay between planetary growth, gap-opening, dust trapping and vortex dynamics. Planets formed within dust traps can have masses that exceed the classical pebble isolation mass, potentially providing massive seeds for the future formation of giant planets. Once pebble accretion ceases, the local dust size distribution is depleted in large grains, and much of the remaining dust mass is trapped in the system's L$_5$ Lagrange point, providing potentially observable signatures of this evolution.
#### Thermal and magnetic evolution of an Earth-like planet with a basal magma ocean

 - **Abstract**
 Earth's geodynamo has operated for over 3.5 billion years. The magnetic field is currently powered by thermocompositional convection in the outer core, which involves the release of light elements and latent heat as the inner core solidifies. However, since the inner core nucleated no more than 1.5 billion years ago, the early dynamo could not rely on these buoyancy sources. Given recent estimates of the thermal conductivity of the outer core, an alternative mechanism may be required to sustain the geodynamo prior to nucleation of the inner core. One possibility is a silicate dynamo operating in a long-lived basal magma ocean. Here, we investigate the structural, thermal, buoyancy, and magnetic evolution of an Earth-like terrestrial planet. Using modern equations of state and melting curves, we include a time-dependent parameterization of the compositional evolution of an iron-rich basal magma ocean. We combine an internal structure integration of the planet with energy budgets in a coupled core, basal magma ocean, and mantle system. We determine the thermocompositional convective stability of the core and the basal magma ocean, and assess their respective dynamo activity using entropy budgets and magnetic Reynolds numbers. Our conservative nominal model predicts a transient basal magma ocean dynamo followed by a core dynamo after 1 billion years. The model is sensitive to several parameters, including the initial temperature of the core-mantle boundary, the parameterization of mantle convection, the composition of the basal magma ocean, the radiogenic content of the planet, as well as convective velocity and magnetic scaling laws. We use the nominal model to constrain the range of basal magma ocean electrical conductivity and core thermal conductivity that sustain a dynamo.
#### Extragalactic Magnetar Giant Flare GRB 231115A: Insights from Fermi/GBM Observations

 - **Abstract**
 We present the detection and analysis of GRB 231115A, a candidate extragalactic magnetar giant flare (MGF) observed by Fermi/GBM and localized by INTEGRAL to the starburst galaxy M82. This burst exhibits distinctive temporal and spectral characteristics that align with known MGFs, including a short duration and a high peak energy. Gamma-ray analyses reveal significant insights into this burst, supporting conclusions already established in the literature: our time-resolved spectral studies provide further evidence that GRB 231115A is indeed a MGF. Significance calculations also suggest a robust association with M82, further supported by a high Bayes factor that minimizes the probability of chance alignment with a neutron star merger. Despite extensive follow-up efforts, no contemporaneous gravitational wave or radio emissions were detected. The lack of radio emission sets stringent upper limits on possible radio luminosity. Constraints from our analysis show no fast radio bursts (FRBs) associated with two MGFs. X-ray observations conducted post-burst by Swift/XRT and XMM/Newton provided additional data, though no persistent counterparts were identified. Our study underscores the importance of coordinated multi-wavelength follow-up and highlights the potential of MGFs to enhance our understanding of short GRBs and magnetar activities in the cosmos. Current MGF identification and follow-up implementation are insufficient for detecting expected counterparts; however, improvements in these areas may allow for the recovery of follow-up signals with existing instruments. Future advancements in observational technologies and methodologies will be crucial in furthering these studies.
#### Validation of straight-line signal propagation for radio signal of very inclined cosmic ray air showers

 - **Abstract**
 An ongoing challenge for radio-based detectors of high-energy cosmic particles is the accurate description of radio signal propagation in natural non-uniform media. For radio signals originating from extensive air showers, the current state of the art simulations often implicitly assume straight-line signal propagation. This while the refraction due to a non-uniform atmosphere is expected to have an effect on the received signal and associated reconstruction that is currently not completely understood for the most inclined geometries. Here, we present a study regarding the validity of assuming straight-line signal propagation when simulating radio emission associated with very inclined air shower geometries. To this end, the calculation of the electric field based on the end-point formalism used in CoREAS was improved by use of tabulated ray tracing data. We find that including ray curvature effects into the end-point formalism calculation introduces changes of up to a few percent in fluence for frequencies up to 1.2 GHz and zenith angles up to 88°.
#### Bulk and atmospheric metallicities as direct probes of sequentially varying accretion mechanisms of gas and solids onto planets

 - **Abstract**
 Core accretion is the standard scenario of planet formation, wherein planets are formed by sequential accretion of gas and solids, and is widely used to interpret exoplanet observations. However, no direct probes of the scenario have been discussed yet. Here, we introduce an onion-like model as one idealization of sequential accretion and propose that bulk and atmospheric metallicities of exoplanets can be used as direct probes of the process. Our analytical calculations, coupled with observational data, demonstrate that the trend of observed exoplanets supports the sequential accretion hypothesis. In particular, accretion of planetesimals that are $\gtrsim $ 100 km in size is most favored to consistently explain the observed trends. The importance of opening gaps in both planetesimal and gas disks following planetary growth is also identified. New classification is proposed, wherein most observed planets are classified into two interior statuses: globally mixed and locally (well-)mixed. Explicit identification of the locally (well-)mixed status enables reliable verification of sequential accretion. During the JWST era, the quality and volume of observational data will increase drastically and improve exoplanet characterization. This work provides one key reference of how both the bulk and atmospheric metallicities can be used to constrain gas and solid accretion mechanisms of planets.
