#### Black-Hole Formation Accompanied by the Supernova Explosion of a  40-M$_{\odot}$ Progenitor Star
 - **Authors:** Adam Burrows, David Vartanyan, Tianshu Wang
 - **Subjects:** Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)

 - **Abstract**
 We have simulated the collapse and evolution of the core of a solar-metallicity 40-M$_{\odot}$ star and find that it explodes vigorously by the neutrino mechanism. This despite its very high ``compactness". Within $\sim$1.5 seconds of explosion, a black hole forms. The explosion is very asymmetrical and has a total explosion energy of $\sim$1.6$\times$10$^{51}$ ergs. At black hole formation, its baryon mass is $\sim$2.434 M$_{\odot}$ and gravitational mass is 2.286 M$_{\odot}$. Seven seconds after black hole formation an additional $\sim$0.2 M$_{\odot}$ is accreted, leaving a black hole baryon mass of $\sim$2.63 M$_{\odot}$. A disk forms around the proto-neutron star, from which a pair of neutrino-driven jets emanates. These jets accelerate some of the matter up to speeds of $\sim$45,000 km s$^{-1}$ and contain matter with entropies of $\sim$50. The large spatial asymmetry in the explosion results in a residual black hole recoil speed of $\sim$1000 km s$^{-1}$. This novel black-hole formation channel now joins the other black-hole formation channel between $\sim$12 and $\sim$15 M$_{\odot}$ discovered previously and implies that the black-hole/neutron-star birth ratio for solar-metallicity stars could be $\sim$20%. However, one channel leaves black holes in perhaps the $\sim$5-15 M$_{\odot}$ range with low kick speeds, while the other leaves black holes in $\sim$2.5 M$_{\odot}$ mass range with high kick speeds. This exotic channel of lower-mass black hole formation, accompanied by a very asymmetrical supernova explosion, reveals the importance of performing detailed and fully 3D simulations in order to determine the mapping of initial states to outcomes in the core-collapse context.
#### Cometary dust collected by MIDAS on board Rosetta II. Particle shape  descriptors and pristineness evaluation

 - **Abstract**
 The MIDAS (Micro-Imaging Dust Analysis System) atomic force microscope on board the Rosetta comet orbiter investigated and measured the 3D topography of a few hundred nm to tens of $\mu$m sized dust particles of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko with resolutions down to a few nanometers, giving insights into the physical processes of our early Solar System. We analyze the shapes of the cometary dust particles collected by MIDAS on the basis of a recently updated particle catalog with the aim to determine which structural properties remained pristine. We develop a set of shape descriptors and metrics such as aspect ratio, elongation, circularity, convexity, and particle surface/volume distribution, which can be used to describe the distribution of particle shapes. Furthermore, we compare the structure of the MIDAS dust particles and the clusters in which the particles were deposited to those found in previous laboratory experiments and by Rosetta/COSIMA. Finally, we combine our findings to calculate a pristineness score for MIDAS particles and determine the most pristine particles and their properties. We find that the morphological properties of all cometary dust particles at the micrometer scale are surprisingly homogeneous despite originating from diverse cometary environments (e.g., different collection targets that are associated with cometary activities/source regions and collection velocities/periods). We next find that the types of clusters found by MIDAS show good agreement with those defined by previous laboratory experiments, however, there are some differences to those found by Rosetta/COSIMA. Based on our result, we rate 19 out of 1082 MIDAS particles at least moderately pristine, i.e., they are not substantially flattened by impact, not fragmented, and/or not part of a fragmentation cluster.
#### Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Exoplanet Atmospheres I.  Thermochemical Equilibrium Models
 - **Authors:** Dwaipayan Dubey, Fabian Grübel, Rosa Arenales-Lope, Karan Molaverdikhani, Barbara Ercolano, Christian Rab, Oliver Trapp
 - **Subjects:** Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05946
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.05946
 - **Abstract**
 Context: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons, largely known as PAHs, are widespread in the universe and have been identified in a vast array of astronomical observations from the interstellar medium to protoplanetary discs. They are likely to be associated with the chemical history of the universe and the emergence of life on Earth. However, their abundance on exoplanets remains unknown. Aims: We aim to investigate the feasibility of PAH formation in the thermalized atmospheres of irradiated and non-irradiated hot Jupiters around Sun-like stars. Methods: To this aim, we introduced PAHs in the 1-D self-consistent forward modeling code petitCODE. We simulated a large number of planet atmospheres with different parameters (e.g. carbon to oxygen ratio, metallicity, and effective planetary temperature) to study PAH formation. By coupling the thermochemical equilibrium solution from petitCODE with the 1-D radiative transfer code, petitRADTRANS, we calculated the synthetic transmission and emission spectra for irradiated and non-irradiated planets, respectively, and explored the role of PAHs on planet spectra. Results: Our models show strong correlations between PAH abundance and the aforementioned parameters. In thermochemical equilibrium scenarios, an optimal temperature, elevated carbon to oxygen ratio, and increased metallicity values are conducive to the formation of PAHs, with the carbon to oxygen ratio having the largest effect.
#### Physical properties of methanol (CH$_3$OH) ice as a function of  temperature: Density, infrared band strengths, and crystallization
 - **Authors:** H. Carrascosa, M. Á. Satorre, B. Escribano, R. Martín-Doménech, G. M. Muñoz Caro
 - **Subjects:** Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05980
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.05980
 - **Abstract**
 The presence of methanol among the common ice components in interstellar clouds and protostellar envelopes has been confirmed by the James Webb Space Telescope. Methanol is often detected in the gas phase toward lines of sight shielded from UV radiation. We measured the volumetric density of methanol ice, grown under simulated interstellar conditions, and the infrared spectroscopy at different deposition temperatures and during the warm-up. The IR band strengths are provided and the experimental spectra are compared to those computed with a model. The transition from amorphous to crystalline methanol ice was also explored. Finally, we propose new observations of methanol ice at high resolution to probe the methanol ice structure.
#### Hot Stellar Populations of Berkeley 39 using Swift/UVOT

 - **Abstract**
 Open clusters are excellent tools to probe the history of the Galactic disk and properties of star formation. In this work, we present a study of an old age open cluster Berkley 39 using the observations from UVOT instrument of the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory. Making use of a machine learning algorithm, ML-MOC, we have identified a total of 861 stars as cluster members out of which 17 are blue straggler stars. In this work, we present a characterisation of 2 blue straggler stars. To estimate the fundamental parameters of blue straggler stars and their companions (if any), we constructed spectral energy distributions using UV data from swift/UVOT and GALEX, optical data from Gaia DR3, and infrared (IR) data from 2MASS, Spitzer/IRAC, and WISE. We find excess flux in UV in one blue straggler star, implying the possibility of a hot companion.
