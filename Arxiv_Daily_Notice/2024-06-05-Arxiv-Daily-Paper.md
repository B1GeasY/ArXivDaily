 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the emergence phase of young star clusters in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 628. We use JWST NIRCam and MIRI observations to create spatially resolved maps of the Pa$\alpha$-1.87 $\mu$m and Br$\alpha$-4.05 $\mu$m hydrogen recombination lines, as well as the 3.3 $\mu$m and 7.7 $\mu$m emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We extract 953 compact HII regions and analyze the PAH emission and morphology at ~10 pc scales in the associated photo-dissociation regions (PDRs). While HII regions remain compact, radial profiles help us to define three PAH morphological classes: compact (~ 42%), extended (~ 34%) and open (~24%). The majority of compact and extended PAH morphologies are associated with very young star clusters (<5 Myr), while open PAH morphologies are mainly associated with star clusters older than 3 Myr. We observe a general decrease in the 3.3 $\mu$m and 7.7 $\mu$m PAH band emission as a function of cluster age, while their ratio remains constant with age out to 10 Myr and morphological class. The recovered PAH$_{3.3 \mu{\rm m}}$/PAH$_{7.7 \mu{\rm m}}$ ratio is lower than values reported in the literature for reference models and analyses conducted at larger physical scales. The 3.3 $\mu$m and 7.7 $\mu$m bands are typically associated to neutral and ionised PAHs, respectively. While we expected neutral PAHs to be suppressed in proximity of the ionizing source, the constant PAH$_{3.3 \mu{\rm m}}$/PAH$_{7.7 \mu{\rm m}}$ ratio would indicate that both families of molecules disrupt at similar rates in proximity of the HII regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars grazing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on bound orbits may produce periodic flares over many passages, known as repeating partial tidal disruption events (TDEs). Here we present 3D hydrodynamic simulations of sun-like stars over multiple tidal encounters. The star is significantly restructured and becomes less concentrated as a result of mass loss and tidal heating. The vulnerability to mass loss depends sensitively on the stellar density structure, and the strong correlation between the fractional mass loss $\Delta M/M_*$ and the ratio of the central and average density $\rho_{\mathrm{c}}/\bar\rho$, which was initially derived in disruption simulations of main-sequence stars, also applies for stars strongly reshaped by tides. Over multiple orbits, the star loses progressively more mass in each encounter and is doomed to a complete disruption. Throughout its lifetime, the star may produce numerous weak flares (depending on the initial impact parameter), followed by a couple of luminous flares whose brightness increases exponentially. Flux-limited surveys are heavily biased towards the brightest flares, which may appear similar to the flare produced by the same star undergoing a full disruption on its first tidal encounter. This places new challenges on constraining the intrinsic TDE rates, which needs to take repeating TDEs into account. Other types of stars with different initial density structure (e.g., evolved stars with massive cores) follow distinct evolution tracks, which might explain the diversity of the long-term luminosity evolution seen in recently uncovered repeaters.

 - **Abstract**
 The infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is predicted to displace the inner Milky Way (MW), imprinting an apparent 'reflex motion' on the observed velocities of distant halo stars. We construct the largest all-sky spectroscopic dataset of luminous red giant stars from $50-160$ kpc, including a new survey of the southern celestial hemisphere. We fit the full 6D kinematics of our data to measure the amplitude and direction of the inner MW's motion towards the outer halo. The observed velocity grows with distance such that, relative to halo stars at $100$ kpc, the inner MW is lurching at $\approx 40$ km s$^{-1}$ towards a recent location along the LMC's past orbit. Our measurements align with N-body simulations of the halo's response to a $1.8 \times 10^{11} M_\odot$ LMC on first infall, suggesting that the LMC is at least 15% as massive as the MW. Our findings highlight the dramatic disequilibrium of the MW outskirts, and will enable more accurate measurements of the total mass of our Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of gravitational wave (GW) predictions from five two-dimensional Core Collapse Supernova (CCSN) simulations that varied only in the Equation of State (EOS) implemented. The GW signals from these simulations are used to produce spectrograms in the absence of noise, and the emergent high-frequency feature (HFF) is found to differ quantitatively between simulations. Below 1 kHz, the HFF is well approximated by a first-order polynomial in time. The resulting slope was found to vary between 10-50% across all models. Further, using real interferometric noise we investigated the current capabilities of GW detectors to resolve these differences in HFF slope for a Galactic CCSN. We find that for distances up to 1 kpc, current detectors can resolve HFF slopes that vary by at least 30%. For further Galactic distances, current detectors are capable of distinguishing the upper and lower bounds of the HFF slope for groupings of our models that varied in EOS. With the higher sensitivity of future GW detectors, and with improved analysis of the HFF, our ability to resolve properties of the HFF will improve for all Galactic distances. This study shows the potential of using the HFF of CCSN produced GWs to provide insight into the physical processes occurring deep within CCSN during collapse, and in particular its potential to further constrain the EOS through GW detection.
#### Magnetic field evolution for crystallization-driven dynamos in C/O white dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of magnetic fields generated by the crystallization-driven dynamo in carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (WDs) with masses $\lesssim1.05\ M_{\odot}$. We use scalings for the dynamo to demonstrate that the initial magnetic field strength ($B_{0}$) has an upper limit that depends on the initial convection zone size ($R_{\mathrm{out},0}$) and the WD mass. We solve the induction equation to follow the magnetic field evolution after the dynamo phase ends. We show that the predicted surface magnetic field strength ($B_{\mathrm{surf}}$) differs from $B_{0}$ by at least a factor of $\sim$0.3. This reduction depends on $R_{\mathrm{out},0}$, where values smaller than half of the star radius give $B_{\mathrm{surf}}\lesssim0.01\ B_{0}$. We implement electrical conductivities that account for the solid phase effect on the Ohmic diffusion. We observe that the conductivity increases as the solid core grows, freezing in the magnetic field at a certain point of the evolution and slowing its outwards transport. We study the effect of turbulent magnetic diffusivity induced by the convection and find that for a small $R_{\mathrm{out},0}$, $B_{\mathrm{surf}}$ is stronger than the non-turbulent diffusion cases because of the more rapid transport, but still orders of magnitude smaller than $B_{0}$. Given these limitations, the crystallization-driven dynamo theory could explain only magnetic C/O WDs with field strengths less than a few MG for the mass range 0.45-1.05 $M_{\odot}$. Our results also suggest that a buried fossil field must be at least 100 times stronger than observed surface fields if crystallization-driven convection is responsible for its transport to the surface.

 - **Abstract**
 Many accretion-powered pulsars rotate in magnetocentrifugal disequilibrium, spinning up or down secularly over multi-year intervals. The magnetic dipole moment $\mu$ of such systems cannot be inferred uniquely from the time-averaged aperiodic X-ray flux $\langle L(t) \rangle$ and pulse period $\langle P(t) \rangle$, because the radiative efficiency of the accretion is unknown and degenerate with the mass accretion rate. Here we circumvent the degeneracy by tracking the fluctuations in the unaveraged time series $L(t)$ and $P(t)$ using an unscented Kalman filter, whereupon $\mu$ can be estimated uniquely, up to the uncertainties in the mass, radius and distance of the star. The analysis is performed on Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations for $24$ X-ray transients in the Small Magellanic Cloud, which have been monitored regularly for $\sim 16$ years. As well as independent estimates of $\mu$, the analysis yields time-resolved histories of the mass accretion rate and the Maxwell stress at the disk-magnetosphere boundary for each star, and hence auto- and cross-correlations involving the latter two state variables. The inferred fluctuation statistics convey important information about the complex accretion physics at the disk-magnetosphere boundary.

 - **Abstract**
 We present spectropolarimetric observations of an active region recorded simultaneously in the H$\alpha$ Ca II 8662 Å lines. The sunspot exhibits multiple structures, including a lightbridge and a region where Ca II 8662 Å line core is in emission. Correspondingly, the H$\alpha$ line core image displays brightening in the emission region, with the spectral profiles showing elevated line cores. The stratification of the line-of-sight magnetic field is inferred through non-LTE multiline inversions of the Ca II 8662 Å line and the weak field approximation over the H$\alpha$ line. The field strength inferred from the H$\alpha$ line core is consistently smaller than that inferred from inversions at $\log \tau_{500}$ = $-$4.5. However, the study finds no correlation between the WFA over the core of the H$\alpha$ line and that inferred from inversions at $\log \tau_{500}$ = $-$4.5. In regions exhibiting emission features, the morphology of the magnetic field at $\log \tau_{500}$ = $-$4.5 resembles that at $\log \tau_{500}$ = $-$1, with slightly higher or comparable field strengths. The magnetic field morphology inferred from the core of the H$\alpha$ line is also similar to that inferred from the full spectral range of the H$\alpha$ line in the emission region. The field strength inferred in the lightbridge at $\log \tau_{500}$ = $-$1 is smaller than the surrounding umbral regions and comparable at $\log \tau_{500}$ = $-$4.5. Similarly, the field strength inferred in the lightbridge from the WFA over the H$\alpha$ line appears lower compared to the surrounding umbral regions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an optical polarimetric study of a nearby star-forming region, Lambda-Orionis, to map plane-of-the-sky magnetic field geometry to understand the magnetized evolution of the HII region and associated small molecular clouds. We made multi-wavelength polarization observations of 34 bright stars distributed across the region. R-band polarization measurements focused on small molecular clouds BRC 17 and BRC 18 located at the periphery of the HII region are also presented. The magnetic field lines exhibit a large-scale ordered orientation consistent with the Planck sub-mm polarization measurements. The magnetic field lines in both the BRCs are found to be roughly in north-south directions; however, a larger dispersion is noticed in the orientation for BRC 17 compared to BRC 18. Using structure-function analysis, the strength of the plane-of-the-sky component of the magnetic field is estimated as $\sim$28 $\mu$G for BRC 17 and $\sim$40 $\mu$G for BRC 18. The average dust grain size and the mean value of the total-to-selective extinction ratio (R$_{V}$) in the HII region are found to be $\sim$0.51 $\pm$ 0.05 $\mu$m and $\sim$2.9 $\pm$ 0.3, respectively. The distance of the whole HII region is estimated as $\sim$392 $\pm$ 8 pc by combining astrometry information from GAIA EDR3 for YSOs associated with BRCs and confirmed members of central cluster Collinder 69.
#### From Chromospheric Evaporation to Coronal Rain: An Investigation of the Mass and Energy Cycle of a Flare

 - **Abstract**
 Chromospheric evaporation (CE) and coronal rain (CR) represent two crucial phenomena encompassing the circulation of mass and energy during solar flares. While CE marks the start of the hot inflow into the flaring loop, CR marks the end, indicating the outflow in the form of cool and dense condensations. With \textit{IRIS} and \textit{AIA/SDO}, we examine and compare the evolution, dynamics, morphology, and energetics of the CR and CE during a C2.1 flare. The CE is directly observed in imaging and spectra in the \ion{Fe}{XXI} line with \textit{IRIS} and in the \ion{Fe}{XVIII} line of AIA, with upward average total speeds of $138\pm[35]~$km~s$^{-1}$ and a temperature of $[9.03\pm3.28]\times10^{6}$~K. An explosive to gentle CE transition is observed, with an apparent reduction in turbulence. From quiescent to gradual flare phase, the amount and density of CR increases by a factor of $\approx4.4$ and 6, respectively. The rain's velocity increases by a 1.4, in agreement with gas pressure drag. In contrast, the clump widths variation is negligible. The location and morphology of CE match closely those of the rain showers, with similar CE sub-structure to the rain strands, reflecting fundamental scales of mass and energy transport. We obtain a CR outflow mass three times larger than the CE inflow mass, suggesting the presence of unresolved CE, perhaps at higher temperatures. The CR energy corresponds to half that of the CE. These results suggest an essential role of coronal rain in the mass-energy cycle of a flare.

 - **Abstract**
 The problem of Astrophysical Jet formation from relativistic accretion disks through the establishment of relativistic disk-powerful jet equilibrium structure is studied applying the Beltrami-Bernoulli equilibrium approach of Shatashvili & Yoshida 2011; Arshilava et al. 2019. Accretion disk is weakly magnetized consisting of fully ionized relativistic electron-ion plasma and photon gas strongly coupled to electrons due to Thompson Scattering. %hence, making the behavior of photon gas similar to that of "a charged fluid". Analysis is based on the generalized Shakura-Sunyaev $\alpha $-turbulent dissipation model for local viscosity (being the main source of accretion), in which the contributions from both the photon and ion gases are taken into account. Ignoring the self-gravitation in the disk we constructed the analytical self-similar solutions for the equilibrium relativistic disk-jet structure characteristic parameters in the field of gravitating central compact object for the force-free condition. It is shown, that the magnetic field energy in the Jet is several orders greater compared to that of accretion disk, while jet-outflow is locally Super-Alfvénic with local {\it Plasma-beta} $< 1$ near the jet-axis. The derived solutions can be used to analyze the astrophysical jets observed in binary systems during the star formation process linking the jet properties with the parameters of relativistic accretion disks of electron-ion-photon gas.
#### Understanding the chemistry of the young stellar object G29.862-0.0044

 - **Abstract**
 In previous works, we have investigated the star-forming region G29.96$-$0.02 where the massive young stellar object (MYSO) G29.862$-$0.0044 (hereafter G29) is embedded in a hot molecular core. In one of them, of multiwavelength nature, using data from the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE), data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), and photometric data from NIRI-Gemini, G29 was investigated at different spatial scales. However, the intriguing morphology of G29 in the near-infrared, together with the distribution of the associated molecular gas, reveals that the star-formation scenario is far from being understood. This work incorporates the analysis of the emission of several molecular lines acquired with ALMA that were not previously examined (eg.,~CH$_{3}$OH, HC$_{3}$N, H$_{ 2}$CO, C$^{34}$S, H$_{2}$CS) as well as a new determination of the temperature of the region. Additionally, we present the progress of results obtained through new observations in the near-infrared, in this case spectroscopic, using NIFS-Gemini, and in radio continnum obtained with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA). This research allows us to carry out a detailed chemical study of the region, which will contribute to the understanding of the physical processes involved in the high-mass star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrochemical models are important tools to interpret observations of molecular and atomic species in different environments. However, these models are time-consuming, precluding a thorough exploration of the parameter space, leading to uncertainties and biased results. Using neural networks to simulate the behavior of astrochemical models is a way to circumvent this problem, providing fast calculations that are based on real astrochemical models. In this paper, we present a fast neural emulator of the astrochemical code Nautilus based on conditional neural fields. The resulting model produces the abundance of 192 species for arbitrary times between 1 and 10$^7$ years. Uncertainties well below 0.2 dex are found for all species, while the computing time is of the order of 10$^4$ smaller than Nautilus. This will open up the possibility of performing much more complex forward models to better understand the physical properties of the interstellar medium. As an example of the power of these models, we ran a feature importance analysis on the electron abundance predicted by Nautilus. We found that the electron density is coupled to the initial sulphur abundance in a low density gas. Increasing the initial sulphur abundance from a depleted scenario to the cosmic abundance leads to an enhancement of an order of magnitude of the electron density. This enhancement can potentially influence the dynamics of the gas in star formation sites.
#### The impact of asteroseismically calibrated internal mixing on nucleosynthetic wind yields of massive stars

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroseismology gives us the opportunity to look inside stars and determine their internal properties. Based on these observations, estimations can be made for the amount of the convective boundary mixing and envelope mixing of such stars, and the shape of the mixing profile in the envelope. However, these results are not typically included in stellar evolution models. We aim to investigate the impact of varying convective boundary mixing and envelope mixing in a range based on asteroseismic modelling in stellar models, both for the stellar structure and for the nucleosynthetic yields. In this first study, we focus on the pre-explosive evolution of a 20Msun star and evolve the models to the final phases of carbon burning. We vary the convective boundary mixing, implemented as step-overshoot, with the overshoot parameter in the range 0.05-0.4 and the amount of envelope mixing in the range 1-10$^{6}$ with a mixing profile based on internal gravity waves. We use a large nuclear network of 212 isotopes to study the nucleosynthesis. We find that enhanced mixing according to asteroseismology of main-sequence stars, both at the convective core boundary and in the envelope, has significant effects on the nucleosynthetic wind yields. Our evolutionary models beyond the main sequence diverge in yields from models based on rotational mixing, having longer helium burning lifetimes and lighter helium-depleted cores. We find that the asteroseismic ranges of internal mixing calibrated from core hydrogen burning stars lead to similar wind yields as those resulting from the theory of rotational mixing. Adopting the seismic mixing levels beyond the main sequence, we find earlier transitions to radiative carbon burning compared to models based on rotational mixing. This influences the compactness and the occurrence of shell-mergers, which may affect the supernova properties and explosive nucleosynthesis.
#### The story of SN 2021aatd -- a peculiar 1987A-like supernova with an early-phase luminosity excess

 - **Abstract**
 There is a growing number of peculiar events that cannot be assigned to any of the main supernova (SN) classes. SN 1987A and a handful of similar objects, thought to be explosive outcomes of blue supergiant stars, belong to them: while their spectra closely resemble those of H-rich (IIP) SNe, their light-curve (LC) evolution is very different. Here we present the detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis of SN 2021aatd, a peculiar Type II explosion: while its early-time evolution resembles that of the slowly evolving, double-peaked SN 2020faa (however, at a lower luminosity scale), after $\sim$40 days, its LC shape becomes similar to that of SN 1987A-like explosions. Beyond comparing LCs, color curves, and spectra of SN 2021aatd to that of SNe 2020faa, 1987A, and of other objects, we compare the observed spectra with our own SYN++ models and with the outputs of published radiative transfer models. We also modeled the pseudo-bolometric LCs of SNe 2021aatd and 1987A assuming a two-component (core+shell) ejecta, and involving the rotational energy of a newborn magnetar in addition to radioactive decay. We find that both the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of SN 2021aatd can be well described with the explosion of a $\sim$15 $M_\odot$ blue supergiant star. Nevertheless, SN 2021aatd shows higher temperatures and weaker Na ID and Ba II 6142 A lines than SN 1987A, which is reminiscent of rather to IIP-like atmospheres. With the applied two-component ejecta model (counting with both decay and magnetar energy), we can successfully describe the bolometric LC of SN 2021aatd, including the first $\sim$40-day long phase showing an excess compared to 87A-like SNe but being strikingly similar to that of the long-lived SN 2020faa. Nevertheless, finding a unified model that also explains the LCs of more luminous events (like SN 2020faa) is still a matter of concern.
