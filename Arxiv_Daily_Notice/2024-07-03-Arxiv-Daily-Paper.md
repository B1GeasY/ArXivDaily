 - **Abstract**
 Recent simulations have demonstrated the formation of 'flux-frozen' and hyper-magnetized disks, qualitatively distinct from both classical $\alpha$ disks and magnetically-arrested disks, as a natural consequence of fueling gas to supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei. We previously showed that the dynamical structure of said disks can be approximated by simple analytic similarity models. Here we study the thermal properties of these models over a wide range of physical scales and accretion rates. We show there are several characteristic zones: a dusty 'torus'-like region, a multi-phase neutral and then multi-phase ionized, broad line-emitting region interior to the sublimation radius, before finally a transition to a thermal accretion disk with a warm Comptonizing layer. The disks are strongly-flared with large scale heights, and reprocess and/or scatter an order-one fraction of the central disk emission. As a result, this simple accretion disk model predicts phenomena including the existence of a dusty torus and its covering factor, geometry, clumpiness, and dust temperatures; a broad-line-region (BLR) with its characteristic sizes and luminosities and ionization properties; extended scattering/reprocessing surfaces producing cooler disk continuum and apparently large observed disk sizes; and existence of warm Comptonizing layers and hard coronal gas. Remarkably, these properties emerge without our having to introduce new components or parameters: they are all part of the accretion flow if the disks are in the hyper-magnetized limit.
#### A non-accreting neutron star and $\delta$ Scuti candidate revealed by asteroseismological modelling and radial velocity measurements

 - **Abstract**
 SZ Lyn is an astrometric binary consisting of a $\delta$ Scuti star and an unseen component. The two stars around each other in an almost circular orbit (e=0.186) with a period of about 3.32 years. We aim to explore the physical properties of the two components using the radial velocity method and asteroseismology. Our results show that the $\delta$ Scuti variable is a post-main sequence star with a helium core ($M_{\rm He}$= 0.1671$^{+0.0028}_{-0.0045}$ M$_{\odot}$ and $R_{\rm He}$= 0.1414$^{+0.0035}_{-0.0020}$ R$_{\odot}$) surrounded by a burning hydrogen shell; its fundamental parameters is accurately calculated to be $M$=1.82$^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ M$_{\odot}$, $R$=2.91$^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ R$_{\odot}$, $L$=17.07$^{+1.28}_{-2.61}$ L$_{\odot}$, and $X_c$=0.078$^{+0.021}_{-0.004}$; the mass of the invisible object is thus estimated to be $M_{\rm co}$=1.68 $^{+0.62}_{-0.60}$ M$_{\odot}$. Combined with the low-resolution LAMOST spectrum, we suggest that the unseen object is an neutron star candidate. Our work demonstrates the methodology of using the radial velocity method and asteroseismology to detect the compact object in such an astrometric binary.
#### Particle acceleration at the bow shock of runaway star LS 2355: non-thermal radio emission but no $\gamma$-ray counterpart

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars that travel at supersonic speeds can create bow shocks as their stellar winds interact with the surrounding interstellar medium. These bow shocks - prominent sites for mechanical feedback of individual massive stars - are predominantly observed in the infrared band. Confirmed high-energy emission from stellar bow shocks has remained elusive and confirmed radio counterparts, while rising in recent years, remain rare. Here, we present an in-depth multi-wavelength exploration of the bow shock driven by LS 2355, focusing on its non-thermal properties. Using the most-recent Fermi source catalogue, we rule out its previously-proposed association with an unidentified $\gamma$-ray source. Furthermore, we use deep ASKAP observations from the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey and the Evolutionary Map of the Universe survey to identify a non-thermal radio counterpart: the third spectrally confirmed non-thermal bow shock counterpart after BD +43$^{\rm o}$ 3654 and BD +60$^{\rm o}$ 2522. We finally use WISE IR data and Gaia to study the surrounding ISM and update the motion of LS 2355. Specifically, we derive a substantially reduced stellar velocity, $v_* = 7.0\pm2.5$ km/s, compared to previous estimates. The observed non-thermal properties of the bow shock can be explained by an interaction between the wind of LS 2355 and a dense HII region, at a magnetic field close to the maximum magnetic field strength allowed by the compressibility of the ISM. Similar to earlier works, we find that the thermal radio emission of the shocked ISM is likely to be substantially suppressed for it to be consistent with the observed radio spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Star clusters, composed of stars born from the same molecular cloud, serve as invaluable natural laboratories for understanding the fundamental processes governing stellar formation and evolution. Aims: This study aims to investigate correlations between the Mean Interdistance ($\bar{D_{i}}$), Mean Closest Interdistance ($\bar{D_{c}}$) and Median Weighted Central Interdistance ($\bar{D_{cc}}$) with the age of star clusters, examining their evolutionary trends and assessing the robustness of these quantities as possible age indicators. Methods: We selected a sample of open clusters in the solar region and with a representative number of members (e.g. well populated and without outliers). The interdistances are derived from the spatial distribution of member stars within a cluster. Their evolution over time allows us to use them as an age indicators for star clusters. Results: Our investigation reveals a high-significant correlation between the interdistances and cluster age. Considering the full sample of clusters between 7 and 9 kpc, the relationship is very broad. This is due to uncertainties in parallax, which increase with increasing distance. In particular, we must limit the sample to a maximum distance from the Sun of about 200 pc to avoid artificial effects on cluster shape and on the spatial distribution of their stars along the line of sight. Conclusions: By conservatively restraining the distance to a maximum of $\sim$200 pc, we have established a relationship between the interdistances and the age of the clusters. In our sample, the relationship is mainly driven by the internal expansion of the clusters, and is marginally affected by external perturbative effects. Such relation might enhance our comprehension of cluster dynamics and might be used to derive cluster dynamical ages.
#### Evidence for particle acceleration approaching PeV energies in the W51 complex

 - **Abstract**
 The $\gamma$-ray emission from the W51 complex is widely acknowledged to be attributed to the interaction between the cosmic rays (CRs) accelerated by the shock of supernova remnant (SNR) W51C and the dense molecular clouds in the adjacent star-forming region, W51B. However, the maximum acceleration capability of W51C for CRs remains elusive. Based on observations conducted with the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), we report a significant detection of $\gamma$ rays emanating from the W51 complex, with energies from 2 TeV to 200 TeV. The LHAASO measurements, for the first time, extend the $\gamma$-ray emission from the W51 complex beyond 100 TeV and reveal a significant spectrum bending at tens of TeV. By combining the ``$\pi^0$-decay bump" featured data from Fermi-LAT, the broadband $\gamma$-ray spectrum of the W51 region can be well-characterized by a simple pp-collision model. The observed spectral bending feature suggests an exponential cutoff at $\sim400$~TeV or a power-law break at $\sim200$~TeV in the CR proton spectrum, most likely providing the first evidence of SNRs serving as CR accelerators approaching the PeV regime. Additionally, two young star clusters within W51B could also be theoretically viable to produce the most energetic $\gamma$ rays observed by LHAASO. Our findings strongly support the presence of extreme CR accelerators within the W51 complex and provide new insights into the origin of Galactic CRs.
#### Runaway BN supergiant star HD 93840: Progenitor of an imminent core-collapse supernova above the Galactic plane

 - **Abstract**
 We present a quantitative spectral analysis of the extreme nitrogen-enhanced supergiant HD 93840 (BN1 Ib) at an intermediate galactic latitude. Based on an optical high-resolution spectrum and complementary ultraviolet and infrared (spectro-)photometry, in addition to Gaia data, we carried out a full characterisation of the star's properties. We used both hydrostatic and unified (photosphere+wind) model atmospheres that account for deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium. A highly unusual surface CNO-mixing signature and a marked stellar overluminosity compared to the mass imply a binary channel for the star's past evolution. The kinematics shows that it has reached its current position above the Galactic plane as a runaway star, likely ejected by the supernova explosion of its former companion star. Its current bulk composition, with a notably increased mean molecular weight due to core He- and progressed shell H-burning, suggests an advanced evolutionary stage. It is poised to yield a rare core-collapse supernova of a blue supergiant about ten OB star population scale heights above the Galactic disk relatively soon, contributing to the metal enrichment of the circumgalactic medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Using new continuum and molecular line data from the ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming Regions (ATOMS) survey and archival VLA, 4.86 GHz data, we present direct observational evidence of hierarchical triggering relating three epochs of massive star formation in a ring-like H II region, G24.47+0.49. We find from radio flux analysis that it is excited by a massive star(s) of spectral type O8.5V-O8V from the first epoch of star formation. The swept-up ionized ring structure shows evidence of secondary collapse, and within this ring a burst of massive star formation is observed in different evolutionary phases, which constitutes the second epoch. ATOMS spectral line (e.g., HCO$^+$(1-0)) observations reveal an outer concentric molecular gas ring expanding at a velocity of $\sim$ 9 $\rm km\,s^{-1}$, constituting the direct and unambiguous detection of an expanding molecular ring. It harbors twelve dense molecular cores with surface mass density greater than 0.05 $\rm g\,cm^{-2}$, a threshold typical of massive star formation. Half of them are found to be subvirial, and thus in gravitational collapse, making them third epoch of potential massive star-forming sites.

 - **Abstract**
 Methanol is an abundant molecule in space. The column density of CH$_3^{18}$OH is in some star-forming regions so high that the search for CH$_3^{17}$OH is promising. But only very few transition frequencies of CH$_3^{17}$OH with a microwave accuracy have been published thus far. We recorded the rotational spectrum of CH$_3^{17}$OH between 38 and 1095 GHz employing a methanol sample enriched in $^{17}$O to 20\%. A torsion-rotation Hamiltonian model based on the rho-axis method was employed to fit the data, as in our previous studies. We searched for rotational transitions of CH$_3^{17}$OH in the imaging spectral line survey ReMoCA obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) toward the high-mass star-forming region Sgr B2(N). The observed spectra were modeled under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The assignments cover $0 \le J \le 45$, $K_a \le 16$, and mainly the $v_ t = 0$ and 1 torsional states. The Hamiltonian model describes our data well. The model was applied to derive a line list for radio-astronomical observations. We report a tentative detection of CH$_3^{17}$OH along with secure detections of the more abundant isotopologs of methanol toward Sgr B2(N2b). The derived column densities yield isotopic ratios $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = 25, $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O = 240, and $^{18}$O/$^{17}$O = 3.3, which are consistent with values found earlier for other molecules in Sgr B2. The agreement between the $^{18}$O/$^{17}$O isotopic ratio that we obtained for methanol and the $^{18}$O/$^{17}$O ratios reported in the past for other molecules in Sgr B2(N) strongly supports our tentative interstellar identification of CH$_3^{17}$OH. The accuracy of the derived line list is sufficient for further radio astronomical searches for this methanol isotopolog toward other star-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 We studied eight new doubly eclipsing stellar systems. We found that they are all rare examples of quadruple systems of 2 + 2 architecture, where both inner pairs are eclipsing binaries. Until now, such a configuration had only been proven for dozens of systems on the whole sky. We enlarged this rare group of systems with four stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) galaxy and four brighter stars on the northern sky. These analysed systems are the following: OGLE SMC-ECL-2339 (both eclipsing periods of 0.72884 days and 3.39576 days; mutual orbital period of 5.95 years); OGLE SMC-ECL-3075 (1.35890 d, 2.41587 d, 9.75 yr); OGLE SMC-ECL-4756 (0.91773 d, 2.06047 d, 4.34 yr); OGLE SMC-ECL-6093 (0.90193 d, 2.03033 d, 31.2 yr); GSC 01949-01700 (0.24058 d, 0.75834 d, 21.7 yr); ZTF J171602.61+273606.5 (0.36001 d, 4.51545 d, 19.5 yr); WISE J210935.8+390501 (0.33228 d, 3.51575 d, 1.9 yr); and V597 And (0.46770 d, 0.35250, 20.4 yr). These systems constitute a rare selection of W UMa stars among the doubly eclipsing quadruples. For all of the systems, new dedicated observations were obtained as well. V597 And is definitely the most interesting system for several reasons: (1) the system is the brightest in our sample; (2) it is a rare quintuple (2 + 2) + 1 system; and (3) it is also closest to the Sun. It yielded the predicted angular separation of the two components of 57 mas, which is probably within the detection limits for modern, high-angular-resolution techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalogue of dense cores and filaments in a $3.8^{\circ}\times2.4^{\circ}$ field around the TMC1 region of the Taurus Molecular Cloud. The catalogue was created using photometric data from the Herschel SPIRE and PACS instruments in the 70 $\mu$m, 160 $\mu$m, 250 $\mu$m, 350 $\mu$m, and 500 $\mu$m continuum bands. Extended structure in the region was reconstructed from a Herschel column density map. Power spectra and PDFs of this structure are presented. The PDF splits into log-normal and power-law forms, with the high-density power-law component associated primarily with the central part of TMC1. The total mass in the mapped region is 2000 M$_\odot$, of which 34% is above an extinction of AV $\sim$ 3 mag -- a level that appears as a break in the PDF and as the minimum column density at which dense cores are found. A total of 35 dense filaments were extracted from the column density map. These have a characteristic FWHM width of 0.07 pc, but the TMC1 filament itself has a mean FWHM of $\sim$ 0.13 pc. The thermally supercritical filaments in the region are aligned orthogonal to the prevailing magnetic field direction. Derived properties for the supercritical TMC1 filament support the scenario of it being relatively young. A catalogue of 44 robust and candidate prestellar cores is created and is assessed to be complete down to 0.1 M$_\odot$. The combined prestellar CMF for the TMC1 and L1495 regions is well fit by a single log-normal distribution and is comparable to the standard IMF.
#### First detection of the $J_{-1}\rightarrow(J-$ 1)$_{0}-E$ methanol maser transitions at $J=7$ and $10$

 - **Abstract**
 Class\,I methanol masers provide sensitive information about the shocked environment around star-forming regions. Among the brightest Class~I methanol masers, we have those in the $J_{-1}\rightarrow(J-$ 1)$_{0}-E$ line series, currently reported for the $J=4-9$ transitions, with the only exception being the $J=7$ one at 181.295~GHz, and never expanded to higher $J$ transitions. We aim to search for population inversion in the $7_{-1}\rightarrow6_{0}-E$ and $10_{-1}\rightarrow9_{0}-E$ methanol transition lines at 181.295 and 326.961\,GHz, respectively, and also extend the number of known low-mass star-forming sources harboring Class\,I methanol masers. We employed the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) 12\,m telescope to survey low-mass Galactic sources, focusing on methanol emission lines. We conducted rotation diagrams for all sources with detected $J=7$ methanol line transitions, while employing radiative transfer modeling (both in and out of local thermodynamic equilibrium) to characterize methanol excitation conditions in detail for one specific source with detected masers. We have detected the $7_{-1}\rightarrow6_{0}-E$ and $10_{-1}\rightarrow9_{0}-E$ methanol transitions in six out of nineteen sources. Among them, we firmly determined the $10_{-1}\rightarrow9_{0}-E$ maser nature in CARMA\,7, L1641N, NGC\,2024, and Serpens FIRS, and we claim for the presence of inverted population emission in the $7_{-1}\rightarrow6_{0}-E$ line toward CARMA\,7 and L1641N. This represents the first report of methanol maser emission in these particular transitions. Our study supports previous works indicating that conditions for Class\,I methanol maser emission are satisfied in low-mass star-forming regions and expands the range of detectable frequencies toward higher values.
