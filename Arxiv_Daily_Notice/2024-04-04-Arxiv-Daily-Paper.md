 - **Abstract**
 We aim to identify and characterize cores in the high-mass proto-cluster W49, determine their evolutionary stages and measure the associated lifetimes. We built a catalog of 129 cores extracted from an ALMA 1.3 mm continuum image at 0.26" (2900 au) angular resolution. The association between cores and Hyper/Ultra Compact HII (H/UC HII) regions was established from the analysis of VLA 3.3 cm continuum and H30$\alpha$ line observations. We also looked for emission of hot molecular cores (HMCs) using the methyl formate doublet at 218.29 GHz. We identified 40 cores associated with an H/UC HII region and 19 HMCs over the ALMA mosaic. The 52 cores with an H/UC HII region and/or a HMC are assumed to be high-mass protostellar cores, while the rest of the core population likely consists in prestellar cores and low-mass protostellar cores. We found a good agreement between the two tracers of ionized gas, with 23 common detections and only four cores detected at 3.3 cm and not in H30$\alpha$. The spectral indexes from 3.3 cm to 1.3 mm range from 1, for the youngest cores with partially optically thick free-free emission, to about -0.1, that is optically thin free-free emission obtained for cores likely more evolved. Using as a reference the H/UC HII regions, we found the statistical lifetimes of the HMC and massive protostellar phases in W49N to be about $6\times10^4$ yr and $1.4\times10^5$ yr, respectively. We also showed that HMC can co-exist with H/UC HII regions during a short fraction of the core lifetime, about $2\times10^4$ yr. This indicates a rapid dispersal of the inner molecule envelope once the HC HII is formed.

 - **Abstract**
 Leveraging the high resolution, high sensitivity, and wide frequency coverage of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the QUARKS survey, standing for "Querying Underlying mechanisms of massive star formation with ALMA-Resolved gas Kinematics and Structures", is observing 139 massive star-forming clumps at ALMA Band 6 ($\lambda\sim$ 1.3 mm). This paper introduces the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) 7-m data. Combining multi-wavelength data, we provide the first edition of QUARKS atlas, offering insights into the multiscale and multiphase interstellar medium in high-mass star formation. The ACA 1.3 mm catalog includes 207 continuum sources that are called ACA sources. Their gas kinetic temperatures are estimated using three formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) transitions with a non-LTE radiation transfer model, and the mass and density are derived from a dust emission model. The ACA sources are massive (16-84 percentile values of 6-160 $M_{\odot}$), gravity-dominated ($M\propto R^{1.1}$) fragments within massive clumps, with supersonic turbulence ($\mathcal{M}>1$) and embedded star-forming protoclusters. We find a linear correlation between the masses of the fragments and the massive clumps, with a ratio of 6% between the two. When considering the fragments as representative of dense gas, the ratio indicates a dense gas fraction (DGF) of 6%, although with a wide scatter ranging from 1% to 10%. If we consider the QUARKS massive clumps to be what is observed at various scales, then the size-independent DGF indicates a self-similar fragmentation or collapsing mode in protocluster formation. With the ACA data over four orders of magnitude of luminosity-to-mass ratio ($L/M$), we find that the DGF increases significantly with $L/M$, which indicates clump evolutionary stage. We observed a limited fragmentation at the subclump scale, which can be explained by dynamic global collapse process.

 - **Abstract**
 In this third paper of a series, we study the kinematics of the ionised gas and stars, calculating the dynamical masses of the circumnuclear star-forming regions in the ring of of the face-on spiral NGC 7742. We have used high spectral resolution data from the MEGARA instrument attached to the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) to measure the kinematical components of the nebular emission lines of selected HII regions and the stellar velocity dispersions from the CaT absorption lines that allow the derivation of the associated cluster virialized masses. The emission line profiles show two different kinematical components: a narrow one with velocity dispersion $\sim$ 10 km/s and a broad one with velocity dispersion similar to those found for the stellar absorption lines. The derived star cluster dynamical masses range from 2.5 $\times$ 10$^6$ to 10.0 $\times$ 10$^7$ M$_\odot$. The comparison of gas and stellar velocity dispersions suggests a scenario where the clusters have formed simultaneously in a first star formation episode with a fraction of the stellar evolution feedback remaining trapped in the cluster, subject to the same gravitational potential as the cluster stars. Between 0.15 and 7.07 % of the total dynamical mass of the cluster would have cooled down and formed a new, younger, population of stars, responsible for the ionisation of the gas currently observed.

 - **Abstract**
 Given the rarity of significant solar flares compared to smaller ones, training effective machine learning models for solar activity forecasting is challenging due to insufficient data. This study proposes using generative deep learning models, specifically a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), to create synthetic images of solar phenomena, including flares of varying intensities. By employing a dataset from the AIA instrument aboard the SDO spacecraft, focusing on the 171 {\AA} band that captures various solar activities, and classifying images with GOES X-ray measurements based on flare intensity, we aim to address the data scarcity issue. The DDPM's performance is evaluated using cluster metrics, Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and F1-score, showcasing promising results in generating realistic solar imagery. We conduct two experiments: one to train a supervised classifier for event identification and another for basic flare prediction, demonstrating the value of synthetic data in managing imbalanced datasets. This research underscores the potential of DDPMs in solar data analysis and forecasting, suggesting further exploration into their capabilities for solar flare prediction and application in other deep learning and physical tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 The emergence of large spectroscopic surveys requires homogenising on the same scale the quantities they measure in order to increase their scientific legacy. We developed the SpectroTranslator, a data-driven deep neural network algorithm that can convert spectroscopic parameters from the base of one survey to another. The algorithm also includes a method to estimate the importance that the various parameters play in the conversion from base A to B. As a showcase, we apply the algorithm to transform effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, [Mg/Fe] and los velocity from the base of GALAH into the APOGEE base. We demonstrate the efficiency of the SpectroTranslator algorithm to translate the spectroscopic parameters from one base to another using parameters directly by the survey teams, and are able to achieve a similar performance than previous works that have performed a similar type of conversion but using the full spectrum rather than the spectroscopic parameters, allowing to reduce the computational time, and to use the output of pipelines optimized for each survey. By combining the transformed GALAH catalogue with the APOGEE catalogue, we study the distribution of [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] across the Galaxy, and we find that the median distribution of both quantities present a vertical asymmetry at large radii. We attribute it to the recent perturbations generated by the passage of a dwarf galaxy across the disc or by the infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Although several aspects still need to be refined, in particular how to deal in an optimal manner with regions of the parameter space meagrely populated by stars in the training sample, the SpectroTranslator already shows its capability and promises to play a crucial role in standardizing various spectroscopic surveys onto a unified basis.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of the ordered alignment between the magnetic field and kpc-scale bubbles in the nearby spiral galaxy, NGC\,628. Applying the Velocity Gradient Technique (VGT) on CO spectroscopic data from the ALMA-PHANGS, the magnetic field of NGC\,628 is measured at the scale of 191\,pc ($\sim$ 4\,$''$). The large-scale magnetic field is oriented parallel to the spiral arms and curves around the galactic bubble structures in the mid-infrared emission observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Twenty-one bubble structures have been identified at the edges of spiral arms with scales over 300\,pc, which includes two kpc-scale structures. These bubbles are caused by supernova remnants and prolonged star formation and are similar to the outflow chimneys found in neutral hydrogen in galactic disks. At the edge of the bubbles, the shocks traced by the OIII emission present a curved magnetic field that parallels the bubble's shell. The magnetic field follows the bubble expansion and binds the gas in the shell to trigger further star formation. By analyzing the larger sample of 1694 bubbles, we found a distinct radial-size distribution of bubbles in NGC\,628 indicating the star formation history in the galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 To explain grain growth and destruction in warm media, ice mantle formation and sublimation in cold media, and gas line emission spectroscopy, astrochemical models must mimic the gas--solid abundance ratio. Ice-sublimation mechanisms determine the position of snow lines and the nature of gas emitted by and locked inside planetary bodies in star-forming regions. To interpret observations from the interplanetary and extragalactic interstellar mediums, gas phase abundances must be modelled correctly. This study presents comprehensive thermal desorption data for interstellar ice analogues, aiming to refine astrochemical models by generating a set of benchmarks to evaluate both the kinetics and thermodynamics in astrochemical models. Our experiments focused on temperature-programmed desorption of pure and mixed ices, including Ar, CO, CO2, NH3, CH3OH, and H2O, under ultrahigh vacuum (1 x 10^-10 hPa) and low temperatures (10 K). Each experiment includes the experimental parameters, ice desorption kinetics for pure species, and the desorption yield (gas--solid ratio) for ice mixtures. From the desorption yields, we find common trends in the trapping of molecules when their abundance is compared to water: compact amorphous water ices are capable of trapping up to 20 % of volatiles (Ar, CO, and CO2), ~ 3 % of CH3OH, and ~ 5% NH3 in relation to the water content within the ice matrix; ammonium formate is not trapped in the water ice films, and compact amorphous water ice formed in situ has similar trapping capabilities to a compact amorphous water ice deposited using molecular beams. Our results highlight the limited trapping capacity of compact amorphous water ice for gases, crucial for understanding the formation of interstellar complex organic molecules.

 - **Abstract**
 We surveyed nearly all the embedded protostars in seven nearby clouds (Corona Australis, Aquila, Chamaeleon I & II, Ophiuchus North, Ophiuchus, Serpens) with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at 1.3mm observations with a resolution of 0.1". This survey detected 184 protostellar disks, 90 of which were observed at a resolution of 14-18 au, making it one of the most comprehensive high-resolution disk samples across various protostellar evolutionary stages to date. Our key findings include the detection of new annular substructures in two Class I and two Flat-spectrum sources, while 21 embedded protostars exhibit distinct asymmetries or substructures in their disks. We find that protostellar disks have a substantially large variability in their radii across all classes. In particular, the fraction of large disks with sizes above 40 au decreases with the protostellar evolutionary stage. Compiling the literature data, we discovered an increasing trend of the gas disk radii to dust disk radii ratio ($R_{\rm gas,Kep}/R_{\rm mm}$) with increasing bolometric temperature (${\rm T}_{\rm bol}$). Our results indicate that the dust and gas disk radii decouple during the early Class I stage. We find that Class 0 dust disk size resembled the gas disk size, enabling a direct comparison between models and observational data at the earliest stages of protostellar evolution. We show that the distribution of radii in the 52 Class 0 disks in our sample is in high tension with various disk formation models, indicating that protostellar disk formation remains an unsolved question.
#### Sensitivity of Polarization to Grain Shape: II. Aggregates

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02836
 - **Abstract**
 A previous study (Paper I) investigated the polarization properties of a variety of simple convex grain shapes, some of which were found to be consistent with the observed polarization properties of interstellar dust from far-ultraviolet to far-infrared. Here we study the optical properties of 45 non-convex shapes, all aggregates of $N$ equal-sized spheres. We consider $N=2$, $N=3$, and $N=256$ random aggregates obtained from 3 different aggregation schemes. We also consider "trimmed" $N=256$ aggregates obtained by systematically trimming initially random aggregates to increase either flattening or elongation. The "macroporosities" of the studied aggregates range from ${\cal P}_{\rm macro}=0.18$ (for the $N=2$ bisphere) to ${\cal P}_{\rm macro}\approx 0.85$ (for the $N=256$ "BA" aggregates). The only aggregates consistent with observations of starlight polarization and polarized thermal emission are shapes that have been trimmed to increase their asymmetry. If interstellar grains are high-porosity aggregates, there must be processes causing extreme elongation or flattening; if not, interstellar grains must be dominated by fairly compact structures, with at most moderate porosities. The ratio of polarization in the 10$\mu$m silicate feature to starlight polarization in the optical is shown to be insensitive to porosity and shape. X-ray scattering may be the best tool to determine the porosity of interstellar grains. We propose that modest porosities of interstellar grains could be the result of "photolytic densification". High polarization fractions observed in some Class-0 cores require processes to reduce porosities and/or increase asymmetries of aggregates in dense regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The observation of oxygen (O)- and nitrogen (N)-bearing molecules gives an idea about the complex prebiotic chemistry in the interstellar medium (ISM). In this article, we present the identification of the rotational emission lines of N-bearing molecules ethyl cyanide (C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN), cyanoacetylene (HC$_{3}$N), and O-bearing molecules methyl formate (CH$_{3}$OCHO) towards high-mass protostar IRAS 18089$-$1732 using the Atacama Compact Array (ACA). We also detected the emission lines of both N- and O-bearing molecule formamide (NH$_{2}$CHO) in the envelope of IRAS 18089$-$1732. We have detected the $v$ = 0 and 1 states rotational emission lines of CH$_{3}$OCHO. We also detected the two vibrationally excited states of HC$_{3}$N ($v$7 = 1 and $v$7 = 2). The estimated fractional abundances of C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN, HC$_{3}$N ($v$7 = 1), HC$_{3}$N ($v$7 = 2), and NH$_{2}$CHO towards the IRAS 18089$-$1732 are (1.40$\pm$0.5)$\times$10$^{-10}$, (7.5$\pm$0.7)$\times$10$^{-11}$, (3.1$\pm$0.4)$\times$10$^{-11}$, and (6.25$\pm$0.82)$\times$10$^{-11}$. Similarly, the estimated fractional abundances of CH$_{3}$OCHO ($v$ = 0) and CH$_{3}$OCHO ($v$ = 1) are (1.90$\pm$0.9)$\times$10$^{-9}$ and (8.90$\pm$0.8)$\times$10$^{-10}$, respectively. We also created the integrated emission maps of the detected molecules, and the observed molecules may have originated from the extended envelope of the protostar. We show that C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN and HC$_{3}$N are most probably formed via the subsequential hydrogenation of the CH$_{2}$CHCN and the reaction between C$_{2}$H$_{2}$ and CN on the grain surface of IRAS 18089$-$1732. We found that NH$_{2}$CHO is probably produced due to the reaction between NH$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$CO in the gas phase. Similarly, CH$_{3}$OCHO is possibly created via the reaction between radical CH$_{3}$O and radical HCO on the grain surface of IRAS 18089$-$1732.

 - **Abstract**
 The polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is rich in information but obscured by foreground emission from the Milky Way's interstellar medium (ISM). To uncover relationships between the underlying turbulent ISM and the foreground power spectra, we simulated a suite of driven, magnetized, turbulent models of the ISM, varying the fluid properties via the sonic Mach number, Ms, and magnetic (Alfv\'en) Mach number, Ma. We measure the power spectra of density ($\rho$), velocity ($v$), magnetic field ($H$), total projected intensity ($T$), parity-even polarization ($E$), and parity-odd polarization ($B$). We find that the slopes of all six quantities increase with Ms and tend to increase with Ma. By comparing spectral slopes of $E$ and $B$ to those measured by Planck, we infer typical values of Ms and Ma for the ISM. As the fluid velocity increases, the ratio of BB power to EE power increases to approach a constant value near the Planck-observed value of $\sim 0.5$ for $Ms > 4$, regardless of the magnetic field strength. We also examine correlation-coefficients between projected quantities, and find that $r^{TE}\approx 0.3$, in agreement with Planck, for appropriate combinations of Ms and Ma. {Finally, we consider parity-violating correlations $r^{TB}$ and $r^{EB}$
#### New Herbig-Haro Objects associated with Embedded Sources

 - **Abstract**
 We continue to present the results of the Byurakan Narrow Band Imaging Survey (BNBIS). The main goal of this survey is to search for Herbig-Haro (HH) objects and jets in Galactic dark clouds. In this work we present the results of the search in the vicinity of infrared sources that are bright in the WISE survey and embedded in the dark clouds. The survey is performed with the 1 m Schmidt telescope of Byurakan Observatory, lately equipped with a new CCD detector, which allows to obtain one square degree images of the sky in various filters. Narrow-band filters were used to obtain Halpha and [S II] images, and a medium-width filter was used for the continuum imaging. New HH flows and knots were found near six embedded IR sources, which constitutes a significant proportion of the objects observed. At least two of the newly found HH flows (HH 1226 and HH 1227) lie in isolated dark clouds, thus pointing to active star formation in these regions. Other flows are also located in detached and dense globules or filaments. The length of the HH 1228 flow is about 1 pc; it has also a molecular hydrogen counterpart of the same extension. Coordinates, charts, detailed descriptions and distance estimates are provided. The lower limits of bolometric luminosities of the source stars are typical for low-mass young stellar objects.
