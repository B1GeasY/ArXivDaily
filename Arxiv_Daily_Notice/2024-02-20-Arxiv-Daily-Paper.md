 - **Abstract**
 The intermediate neutron capture process (i-process) can develop during proton ingestion events (PIE), potentially during the early stages of low-mass low-metallicity asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We examine the impact of overshoot mixing on the triggering and development of i-process nucleosynthesis in AGB stars of various initial masses and metallicities. We computed AGB stellar models, with initial masses of 1, 2, 3, and 4 M$_{\odot}$ and metallicities in the $-2.5 \le $ [Fe/H] $\le 0$ range, using the stellar evolution code STAREVOL with a network of 1160 nuclei coupled to the transport equations. We considered different overshooting profiles below and above the thermal pulses, and below the convective envelope. The occurrence of PIEs is found to be primarily governed by the amount of overshooting at the top of pulse ($f_{\rm top}$) and to increase with rising $f_{\rm top}$. For $f_{\rm top} =$ 0, 0.02, 0.04, and 0.1, we find that 0 %, 6 %, 24 %, and 86 % of our 21 AGB models with $-2<$ [Fe/H] $<0$ experience a PIE, respectively. We also find that PIEs leave a $^{13}$C-pocket at the bottom of the pulse that can give rise to an additional radiative s-process nucleosynthesis, and ultimately produce a noticeable mixed i+s chemical signature at the surface. Finally, the chemical abundance patterns of 22 observed r/s-stars candidates with $-2<$ [Fe/H] $<-1$ are found to be in reasonable agreement with our AGB model predictions. The binary status of the dwarfs/giants being unclear, we suggest that these stars have acquired their chemical pattern either from the mass transfer of a now-extinct AGB companion or from an early generation AGB star that polluted the natal cloud. Stricter constraints from multi-dimensional hydrodynamical models on overshoot coefficients could deliver new insights into the contribution of AGB stars to heavy elements in the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 The far-infrared (FIR) opacity of dust in dark clouds within the Ophiuchus molecular cloud is investigated through multi-wavelength infrared observations from UKIDSS, Spitzer and Herschel. Employing the infrared color excess technique with both near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) photometric data, a high-resolution extinction map in the $K$ band ($A_K$) is constructed for three dark clouds: L1689, L1709, and L1712. The derived extinction map has a resolution of $1'$ and reaches a depth of $A_K\sim3$ mag. The FIR optical depths $\tau_{250}$ at a reference wavelength of $250\,\rm \mu m$ are obtained by fitting the Herschel PACS and SPIRE continuum data at 100, 160, 250, 350 and 500 $\rm \mu m$ using a modified blackbody model. The average dust opacity per unit gas mass at $250\rm \mu m$, $r\kappa_{250}$ is determined through a pixel-by-pixel correlation of $\tau_{250}$ with $A_K$, yielding a value of approximately $0.09\,\rm cm^2\,g^{-1}$, which is about 2-3 times higher than the typical value in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM). Additionally, an independent analysis across 16 sub-regions within the Ophiuchus cloud indicates spatial variations in dust opacity, with values ranging from 0.07-0.12$\,\rm cm^2\,g^{-1}$. Although the observed trend of increasing dust opacity with higher extinction implies grain growth, our findings indicate that rapid grain growth clearly not yet occurred in the dark clouds studied in this work.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an observational study of wind acceleration based on four low-ionization broad absorption line (LoBAL) quasars (J0136, J1238, J1259, J1344). J0136 and J1344 (group-1) are radio quiet and show large BAL-velocity shifts as opposed to stable line-locking associated absorption lines (AALs). Notably, J1344 displays a linear relation between BAL-velocity shift and time interval over three consecutive epochs, characteristic of compelling evidence for BAL acceleration. J1238 and J1259 (group 2) exhibit small BAL-velocity shifts along with steep-spectrum, weak radio emission at 3.0 and 1.4 GHz. All four quasars have spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with a peak at $\lambda_{\rm rest }\sim10~\mu$m, suggesting a link between the BAL acceleration and hot dust emission. The group-2 quasars are redder than group-1 quasars and have a steeper rise at $1<\lambda_{\rm rest }<3~\mu$m in their SEDs. All but J1238 exhibit a steep rise followed by a plateau-like time evolution in BAL-velocity shift. Our investigations, combined with previous studies of BAL acceleration, indicate that (1) the BAL-ISM coupling process is one of the major avenues for the origin of quasar reddening and patchy obscuration, (2) AAL outflows are ubiquitous and likely signify large-scale remnants of BAL winds coupled to interstellar medium (ISM), and (3) wind deceleration that is closely linked to the BAL-ISM coupling process may produce weak radio emission in otherwise radio-quiet quasars.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-hot Jupiters present a unique opportunity to understand the physics and chemistry of planets at extreme conditions. WASP-12b stands out as an archetype of this class of exoplanets. We performed comprehensive analyses of the transits, occultations, and phase curves of WASP-12b by combining new CHEOPS observations with previous TESS and Spitzer data to measure the planet's tidal deformation, atmospheric properties, and orbital decay rate. The planet was modeled as a triaxial ellipsoid parameterized by the second-order fluid Love number, $h_2$, which quantifies its radial deformation and provides insight into the interior structure. We measured the tidal deformation of WASP-12b and estimated a Love number of $h_2=1.55_{-0.49}^{+0.45}$ (at 3.2$\sigma$) from its phase curve. We measured occultation depths of $333\pm24$ppm and $493\pm29$ppm in the CHEOPS and TESS bands, respectively, while the dayside emission spectrum indicates that CHEOPS and TESS probe similar pressure levels in the atmosphere at a temperature of 2900K. We also estimated low geometric albedos of $0.086\pm0.017$ and $0.01\pm0.023$ in the CHEOPS and TESS passbands, respectively, suggesting the absence of reflective clouds in the dayside of the WASP-12b. The CHEOPS occultations do not show strong evidence for variability in the dayside atmosphere of the planet. Finally, we refine the orbital decay rate by 12% to a value of -30.23$\pm$0.82 ms/yr. WASP-12b becomes the second exoplanet, after WASP-103b, for which the Love number has been measured (at 3$sigma$) from the effect of tidal deformation in the light curve. However, constraining the core mass fraction of the planet requires measuring $h_2$ with a higher precision. This can be achieved with high signal-to-noise observations with JWST since the phase curve amplitude, and consequently the induced tidal deformation effect, is higher in the infrared.
#### Evolution of the relation between the mass accretion rate and the  stellar and disk mass from brown dwarfs to stars

 - **Abstract**
 The time evolution of the dependence of the mass accretion rate with the stellar mass and the disk mass represents a fundamental way to understand the evolution of protoplanetary disks and the formation of planets. In this work, we present observations with X-Shooter of 26 Class II very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the Ophiuchus, Cha-I, and Upper Scorpius star-forming regions (SFRs). These new observations extend down to SpT M9 ($\sim$0.02 $M_\odot$) the measurement of the mass accretion rate in Ophiuchus and Cha-I and add 11 very-low-mass stars to the sample of objects studied with broadband spectroscopy in Upper Scorpius. We obtained their SpT, extinction and physical parameters, and we used the intensity of various emission lines to derive their accretion luminosity and mass accretion rates. Combining these new observations with data from the literature, we compare relations between accretion and stellar and disk properties of four different SFRs with different ages: Ophiuchus (1 Myr), Lupus (2 Myr), Cha-I (3 Myr), and Upper Scorpius (5-12 Myr). We find the slopes of the $L_*-L\mathrm{_{acc}}$ and $M_*-\dot{M}\mathrm{_{acc}}$ relationships to steepen between Ophiuchus, Lupus, and Cha-I and that both relationships may be better described with a single power law. We also find the relationship between the disk mass and the mass accretion rate of the stellar population to steepen with time down to the age of Upper Scorpius. Overall, we observe hints of a faster evolution into low accretion rates of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. We also find that brown dwarfs present higher $M\mathrm{_{disk}}/\dot{M}\mathrm{_{acc}}$ ratios (i.e., longer accretion depletion timescales) than stars in Ophiuchus, Lupus, and Cha-I. This apparently contradictory result may imply that the evolution of protoplanetary disks around brown dwarfs is different from what is seen in the stellar regime.

 - **Abstract**
 Similar to the cases of anemone jets, two-sided loop solar jets could also be produced by either flux emergence from the solar interior or small scale filament eruptions. Using the high-quality data from the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO), we analyzed a two-sided loop solar jet triggered by the eruption of a small filament in this paper. The jet was occurred in a pre-existing big filament channel. The detailed processes involved in the small filament eruption, the interaction between the erupted filament and the big filament channel, and the launch of the two-sided loop jet are presented. The observations further revealed notable asymmetry between the two branches of the jet spire, with the northeastern branch is narrow and short, while the southern branch is wide and long and accompanied by discernible untwisting motions. We explored the unique appearance of the jet by employing the local potential field extrapolation to calculate the coronal magnetic field configuration around the jet. The photospheric magnetic flux below the small filament underwent cancellation for approximately 7 hours before the filament eruption, and the negative flux near the southern foot-point of the filament decreased by about 56 percent during this interval. Therefore, we proposed that the primary photospheric driver of the filament eruption and the associated two-sided loop jet in this event is flux cancellation rather than flux emergence.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: This work aims to identify the mechanism driving pulsations in hard X-ray (HXR) and microwave emission during solar flares. Here, by using combined HXR and microwave observations from Solar Orbiter/STIX and EOVSA we investigate an X1.3 GOES class flare, 2022-03-30T17:21:00, which displays pulsations on timescales evolving from ~ 7 s in the impulsive phase to ~ 35 s later in the flare. Methods: The temporal, spatial and spectral evolution of the HXR and microwave pulsations during the impulsive phase of the flare are analysed. Images are reconstructed for individual peaks in the impulsive phase and spectral fitting is performed at high cadence throughout the first phase of pulsations. Results: Imaging analysis demonstrates that the HXR and microwave emission originates from multiple sites along the flare ribbons. The brightest sources and the location of the emission changes in time. Through HXR spectral analysis, the electron spectral index is found to be anti-correlated with the HXR flux showing a "soft-hard-soft" spectral index evolution for each pulsation. The timing of the associated filament eruption coincides with the early impulsive phase. Conclusions: Our results indicate that periodic acceleration and/or injection of electrons from multiple sites along the flare arcade is responsible for the pulsations observed in HXR and microwave. The evolution of pulsation timescales is likely a result of changes in the 3D magnetic field configuration in time related to the associated filament eruption.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasar winds can shock and sweep up ambient interstellar medium (ISM) gas, contributing to galactic quenching. We combine and extend past models of energy-conserving shock bubbles around quasars, investigate model implications from an observational standpoint, and test model predictions using new high-resolution spectroscopic observations of the broad absorption line quasar SDSS J030000.56+004828.0 (J0300). Even with constant energy input from the wind, a bubble's expansion decelerates over time as more ISM gas is swept up. Our new observations enable a direct search for this deceleration. We obtain the tightest reported 3-sigma limit on the average rest-frame deceleration (or acceleration) of a quasar outflow: |a|$<$0.1 km s$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($<3 \times 10^{-4}$ cm s$^{-2}$) in the relatively low-velocity Ca II outflow of J0300 over 9.65 rest-frame years. We can satisfy these limits with certain parameter choices in our model, but the large velocity range of the Ca II absorption in J0300 rules out the hypothesis that such gas shares the velocity of the swept-up ISM gas in a self-similar shock bubble. We investigate the possibility of ram-pressure acceleration of preexisting ISM clouds and conclude that the velocity range seen in Ca II in J0300 is potentially consistent with such an explanation. The Ca II-absorbing gas clouds in J0300 have been inferred to have high densities by Choi et al., in which case they can only have been accelerated to their current speeds if they were originally at least an order of magnitude less dense than they are today.

 Here I present a somewhat personal review of the results of my research carried out in the last couple of decades, mostly focused on the fields of stellar astrophysics, the interstellar medium, and the high energy sources. They have been obtained mainly from dedicated interferometric observations in the radio band at low frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 The classical theory of differentiation states that due to the heat generated by the decay of radioactive elements, some asteroids form an iron core, an olivine-rich mantle, and a crust. The collisional breakup of these differentiated bodies is expected to lead to exposed mantle fragments, creating families of newly-formed asteroids. Among these new objects, some are expected to show an olivine-rich composition in spectroscopic observations. However, several years of spectrophotometric surveys have led to the conclusion that olivine-rich asteroids are rare in the asteroid main belt, and no significant concentration of olivine-rich bodies in any asteroid family has been detected to date. Using ESA's Gaia DR3 reflectance spectra, we show that the family (36256) 1999 XT17 presents a prominence of objects that are likely to present an olivine-rich composition (A-type spectroscopic class). If S-complex asteroids as the second most prominent spectroscopic class in the family are real family members, then arguably the 1999 XT17 family has originated from the break-up of a partially differentiated parent body. Alternatively, if the S-complex asteroids are interlopers, then the 1999 XT17 family could have originated from the breakup of an olivine-rich body. This body could have been part of the mantle of a differentiated planetesimal, which may have broken up in a different region of the Solar System, and one of its fragments (i.e. the parent body of the 1999 XT17 family) could have been dynamically implanted in the main belt.
#### Strong fractionation of deuterium and helium in sub-Neptune atmospheres  along the radius valley

 - **Abstract**
 We simulate atmospheric fractionation in escaping planetary atmospheres using IsoFATE, a new open-source numerical model. We expand the parameter space studied previously to planets with tenuous atmospheres that exhibit the greatest helium and deuterium enhancement. We simulate the effects of EUV-driven photoevaporation and core-powered mass loss on deuterium-hydrogen and helium-hydrogen fractionation of sub-Neptune atmospheres around G, K, and M stars. Our simulations predict prominent populations of deuterium- and helium-enhanced planets along the upper edge of the radius valley with mean equilibrium temperatures of 370 K and as low as 150 K across stellar types. We find that fractionation is mechanism-dependent, so constraining He/H and D/H abundances in sub-Neptune atmospheres offers a unique strategy to investigate the origin of the radius valley around low-mass stars. Fractionation is also strongly dependent on retained atmospheric mass, offering a proxy for planetary surface pressure as well as a way to distinguish between desiccated enveloped terrestrials and water worlds. Deuterium-enhanced planets tend to be helium-dominated and CH4-depleted, providing a promising strategy to observe HDO in the 3.7 um window. We present a list of promising targets for observational follow-up.
#### Revisiting a Core-Jet Laboratory at High Redshift: Analysis of the Radio  Jet in the Quasar PKS 2215+020 at z=3.572

 - **Abstract**
 The prominent radio quasar PKS 2215+020 (J2217+0220) was once labelled as a new laboratory for core--jet physics at redshift z=3.572 because of its exceptionally extended jet structure traceable with very long baseline interferometric (VLBI) observations up to a ~600 pc projected distance from the compact core and a hint of an arcsec-scale radio and an X-ray jet. While the presence of an X-ray jet could not be confirmed later, this active galactic nucleus is still unique at high redshift with its long VLBI jet. Here, we analyse archival multi-epoch VLBI imaging data at five frequency bands from 1.7 to 15.4 GHz covering a period of more than 25 years from 1995 to 2020. We constrain apparent proper motions of jet components in PKS 2215+020 for the first time. Brightness distribution modeling at 8 GHz reveals a nearly 0.02 mas/yr proper motion (moderately superluminal with apparently two times the speed of light), and provides delta=11.5 for the Doppler-boosting factor in the inner relativistic jet that is inclined within 2 deg to the line of sight and has a Gamma=6 bulk Lorentz factor. These values qualify PKS 2215+020 as a blazar, with rather typical jet properties in a small sample of only about 20 objects at z>3.5 that have similar measurements to date. According to the 2-GHz VLBI data, the diffuse and extended outer emission feature at ~60 mas from the core, probably a place where the jet interacts with and decelerated by the ambient galactic medium, is consistent with being stationary, albeit slow motion cannot be excluded based on the presently available data.
#### Testing analytical methods to derive the cosmic-ray ionisation rate in  cold regions via synthetic observations

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays (CRs) heavily impact the chemistry and physics of cold and dense star-forming regions. However, characterising their ionisation rate is still challenging from an observational point of view. In the past, a few analytical formulas have been proposed to infer the cosmic-ray ionization rate $\zeta_2$ from molecular line observations. These have been derived from the chemical kinetics of the involved species, but they have not been validated using synthetic data processed with a standard observative pipeline. We aim to bridge this gap. We perform the radiative transfer on a set of three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of prestellar cores, exploring different initial $\zeta_2$, evolutionary stages, types of radiative transfer (e.g. assuming local-thermodynamic-equilibrium conditions), and telescope responses. We then compute the column densities of the involved tracers to determine $\zeta_2$, using, in particular, the equation proposed by Bovino et. al (2020) and by Caselli et al. (1998) both used nowadays. Our results confirm that the method of Bovino et al. (2020) accurately retrieves the actual $\zeta_2$ within a factor of $2-3$, in the physical conditions explored in our tests. Since we also explore a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer, this work indirectly offers insights into the excitation temperatures of common transitions at moderate volume densities ($n\approx 10^5 \, \rm cm^{-3}$). We have also performed a few tests using the formula proposed by Caselli et al. (1998), which overestimates the actual $\zeta_2$ by at least two orders of magnitudes. We also consider a new derivation of this method, which, however, still leads to large overestimates.

 - **Abstract**
 Certain relations among neutron-star observables that are insensitive to the equation of state are known to exist. Such universal relations have been shown to be valid for cold and stationary neutron stars. Here, we study these relations in more dynamic scenarios: protoneutron stars and hypermassive neutron stars. First, we study protoneutron stars. We use an effective equation of state, extracted from three-dimensional core-collapse supernova simulations, to obtain the structure of spherically symmetric protoneutron stars. We then consider nonradial oscillations to compute their $f$-mode frequency ($f$), as well as slow rotation and small tidal deformation, to compute their moment of inertia ($I$), spin-induced quadrupole moment ($Q$), and Love number. We find that well-established universal relations for cold neutron stars involving these observables ($I$-Love-$Q$ and $f$-Love relations) are approximately valid for protoneutron stars, with a deviation below $\approx$ 10$\%$ for a postbounce time above $\approx$ 0.5 s, considering eight different supernova progenitors and the SFHo equation of state. Next, we study hypermassive neutron stars. We obtain a new universal relation between the $f$-mode frequency and the compactness of cold and nonrotating neutron stars, using bulk quantities. We show that this relation has an equation-of-state-variation of $\approx$ $3\%$, considering a set of ten equations of state. Using results from binary neutron star merger simulations, we study the evolution of hypermassive neutron stars on the $f$-$C$ plane, considering two different mass ratios and the SFHo equation of state. We find that the relation between the peak frequency of the gravitational-wave signal and the compactness from these hypermassive neutron stars deviates from the universal $f$-$C$ relation by 70 $-$ 80$\%$, when the peak frequency is taken directly as a proxy for the $f$-mode.

 - **Abstract**
 This study analyzes secular dynamics using averaged equations that detail tidal effects on the motion of two extended bodies in Keplerian orbits. It introduces formulas for energy dissipation within each body of a binary system. The equations, particularly in contexts like the Sun-Mercury system, can be delineated into a fast-slow system. A significant contribution of this work is the demonstration of the crucial role complex rheological models play in the capture by spin-orbit resonances. This is particularly evident in the notable enlargement of the basin of attraction for Mercury's current state when transitioning from a single characteristic time rheology to a dual characteristic time model, under the constraint that both models comply with the same estimate of the complex Love number at orbital frequency. The study also underscores the importance of Mercury's elastic rigidity on secular timescales.
