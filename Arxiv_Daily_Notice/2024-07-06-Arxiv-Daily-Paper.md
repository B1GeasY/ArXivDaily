 - **Abstract**
 Stellar mergers are one important path to highly magnetised stars. Mergers of two low-mass white dwarfs may create up to every third hot subdwarf star. The merging process is usually assumed to dramatically amplify magnetic fields. However, so far only four highly magnetised hot subdwarf stars have been found, suggesting a fraction of less than $1\%$. We present two high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of the merger of two helium white dwarfs in a binary system with the same total mass of $0.6\,M_\odot$. We analyse one equal-mass merger with two $0.3\,M_\odot$ white dwarfs, and one unequal-mass merger with a $0.25\,M_\odot$ white dwarf and a $0.35\,M_\odot$ white dwarf. We simulate the inspiral, merger, and further evolution of the merger remnant for about $50$ rotations. We find efficient magnetic field amplification in both mergers via a small-scale dynamo, reproducing previous results of stellar merger simulations. The magnetic field saturates at similar strength for both simulations. We then identify a second phase of magnetic field amplification in both merger remnants that happens on a timescale of several tens of rotational periods of the merger remnant. This phase generates a large-scale ordered azimuthal field. We identify it as a large-scale dynamo driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). Finally, we suggest that in the unequal-mass merger remnant, helium burning will eventually start in a shell around a cold core. The convection zone this generates will coincide with the region that contains most of the magnetic energy, probably erasing the strong, ordered field. The equal-mass merger remnant instead will probably ignite burning in the center, retaining its ordered field. Therefore, the mass ratio of the initial merger could be the selecting factor that decides if a merger remnant will stay highly magnetised long after the merger.

 - **Abstract**
 How rapidly a planet grows in mass and how far they may park from the host star depend sensitively on two non-dimensional parameters: Stokes number St and turbulent $\alpha$. Yet, these parameters remain highly uncertain being difficult or impossible to measure directly. Here, we demonstrate how the ringed disks can be leveraged to obtain St and $\alpha$ separately by constructing a simple toy model that combines dust radial equation of motion under aerodynamic drag and coupling to gas motion with the measured distribution of dust masses in Class 0/I disks. Focusing on known systems with well-resolved dust rings, we find that the range of St and $\alpha$ that are consistent with the measured properties of the rings are small: $10^{-4} \lesssim {\rm St} \lesssim 10^{-2}$ and $10^{-5} \lesssim \alpha \lesssim 10^{-3}$. These low St and $\alpha$ ensure the observed rings are stable against clumping. Even in one marginal case where the formation of bound clumps is possible, further mass growth by pebble accretion is inhibited. Furthermore, the derived low $\alpha$ is consistent with the nearly inviscid regime where Type I migration can be prematurely halted. Our analysis predicts minimal planet population beyond $\sim$10s of au where we observe dust rings and significantly more vigorous planet formation inside $\sim$10 AU, consistent with current exo-giant statistics. We close with discussions on the implications of our results on small planet statistics at large orbital distances.
#### Adaptive Habitability of Exoplanets: Thriving Under Extreme Environmental Change

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamic nature of life's ability to thrive in diverse and changing planetary environments suggests that habitability and survival depend on the evolutionary path and life adaptation to environmental conditions. Here we explore such "adaptive habitability" through astro-ecological models. We study the interplay between temperature adaptation and environmental fluctuations, particularly those induced by solar activity and orbital dynamics. We present a simplified ecological-evolutionary model to investigate the limits of life's adaptability on a planetary scale. By incorporating complexities such as multiple niches, migration, species interactions, and realistic temperature variations, we demonstrate the potential for adaptive habitability in the face of both gradual and abrupt environmental changes. Through simulations encompassing monotonic, periodic, and secular dynamical evolution-induced temperature profiles, we identify critical thresholds for survival and extinction, highlighting the importance of phenotypic variance and dispersal rates in adapting to varying environmental conditions. These findings underscore the significance of considering temporal variations in assessing exoplanet habitability and expanding the search space for potentially habitable worlds.

 - **Abstract**
 Synthesized beam (PSF) synthetic observations with and without the antennas in Mexico are analyzed. For a simple continuum observing setup, we generated visibility files and their associated PSF images for a grid of parameters (robust weighting, tapering, and declination). The tests were done for both the MID and MID+Spiral+Core configurations and their cropped versions without antennas in Mexico. We show that the performance of the Array, in terms of the beam properties, is in general significantly better when both the MID array antennas are present in Northern Mexico and observations target southern sources. At a declination of -40 deg, there are increments in the ellipticity of at least ~1.3X and 1.2X for a tapering of 3.0 and 4.0 mas, if the antennas in Mexico are not included. For the parameter space tested, the changes in ellipticity of the MID and MID+Spiral+Core configurations differ by ~10%. Larger tapering values help to reduce the ellipticity for cropped configurations at all declinations, but it will impose more constraints in terms of angular resolution.
#### Mirage Sources and Large TeV Halo-Pulsar Offsets: Exploring the Parameter Space

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the asymmetric propagation of 100 TeV electrons (whose radiation mainly concentrates on 20--30 TeV) in turbulent magnetic fields around pulsars, using GPU-accelerated simulations to explore their trajectories and interactions within pulsar wind nebulae and the interstellar medium. Key results include the identification of ``mirage'' sources indicating significant offsets in high-energy emissions from their originating pulsars, challenging the results of traditional symmetric diffusion models. By varying parameters like source distance, magnetic field strength, and electron injection spectral index, the study delineates their effects on observable phenomena such as the probability that a source has at least one mirage around it, as well as the source separation. Our results offer insights into some puzzling sources observed recently by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), and shed light on the cosmic-ray transport mechanism in the interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 The spatial distribution of the gaseous components of the Milky Way is of great importance for a number of different fields, e.g. Galactic structure, star formation and cosmic rays. However, obtaining distance information to gaseous clouds in the interstellar medium from Doppler-shifted line emission is notoriously difficult given our unique vantage point in the Galaxy. It requires precise knowledge of gas velocities and generally suffers from distance ambiguities. Previous works often assumed the optically thin limit (no absorption), a fixed velocity field, and lack resolution overall. We aim to overcome these issues and improve previous reconstructions of the gaseous constituents of the interstellar medium of the Galaxy. We use 3D Gaussian processes to model correlations in the interstellar medium, including correlations between different lines of sight, and enforce a spatially coherent structure in the prior. For modelling the transport of radiation from the emitting gas to us as observers, we take absorption effects into account. A special numerical grid ensures high resolution nearby. We infer the spatial distributions of HI, CO, their emission line-widths, and the Galactic velocity field in a joint Bayesian inference. We further constrain these fields with complementary data from Galactic masers and young stellar object clusters. Our main result consists of a set of samples that implicitly contain statistical uncertainties. The resulting maps are spatially coherent and reproduce the data with high fidelity. We confirm previous findings regarding the warping and flaring of the Galactic disc. A comparison with 3D dust maps reveals a good agreement on scales larger than approximately 400 pc. While our results are not free of artefacts, they present a big step forward in obtaining high quality 3D maps of the interstellar medium.
#### Shaping Galaxies from the Beginning: Shaking the Cusp by Non-power-law Primordial Spectra

 - **Abstract**
 We consider three cosmological models with non-power-law spectra of primordial density perturbations and test them against $\Lambda$CDM in density profiles. We found that, despite the significant difference in initial conditions, the mean density profiles of all models are still close to the Navarro-Frenk-White one, albeit with some dispersion. We demonstrate that the density profile slopes in the innermost part of halo have a significant evolution with $z$, which can be used to identify the cosmological model. We also present a toy model resulting in the appearance of core in the central part of gravitationally bound dark matter halo.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim at characterizing the population of low-luminosity X-ray sources in the Galactic plane by studying their X-ray spectra and periodic signals in the light curves. We are performing an X-ray survey of the Galactic disk using XMM-Newton, and the source XMMU J173029.8-330920 was serendipitously discovered in our campaign. We performed a follow-up observation of the source using our pre-approved NuSTAR target of opportunity time. We used various phenomenological models in xspec for the X-ray spectral modeling. We also computed the Lomb-Scargle periodogram to search for X-ray periodicity. A Monte Carlo method was used to simulate 1000 artificial light curves to estimate the significance of the detected period. We also searched for X-ray, optical, and infrared counterparts of the source in various catalogs. The spectral modeling indicates the presence of an intervening cloud with $N_{\rm H}\sim(1.5-2.3)\times10^{23}\ \rm cm^{-2}$ that partially absorbs the incoming X-ray photons. The X-ray spectra are best fit by a model representing emission from a collisionally ionized diffuse gas with plasma temperature $kT=26^{+11}_{-5}$ keV. Furthermore, an Fe $K_{\alpha}$ line at $6.47^{+0.13}_{-0.06}$ keV was detected with an equivalent width of the line of $312\pm104$ eV. We discovered a coherent pulsation with a period of $521.7\pm0.8$ s. The 3-10 keV pulsed fraction of the source is around $\sim$50-60\%. The hard X-ray emission with plasma temperature $kT=26^{+11}_{-5}$ keV, iron $K_{\alpha}$ emission at 6.4 keV and a periodic behavior of $521.7\pm0.8$ s suggest XMMU J173029.8-33092 to be an intermediate polar. We estimated the mass of the central white dwarf to be $0.94-1.4\ M_{\odot}$ by assuming a distance to the source of $\sim1.4-5$ kpc.

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsars are subject to accelerations in globular clusters that manifest themselves in both the first and second spin period time derivatives, and can be used to explore the mass distribution of the potentials they inhabit. Here we report on over 20 years of pulsar timing observations of five millisecond radio pulsars in the core of the core-collapse globular cluster NGC\,6752 with the Parkes (Murriyang) and MeerKAT radio telescopes, that have allowed us to measure the proper motions, positions and first and second time derivatives of the pulsars. The pulsar timing parameters indicate that all the pulsars in the core experience accelerations and jerks that can be explained only if an amount of non-luminous mass of at least $2.56\times10^3M_\odot$ is resent in the core of NGC\,6752. On the other hand, our studies highly disfavour the presence of an intermediate mass black hole at the center of the cluster, with a mass equal to or greater than $\sim3000M_\odot$.
#### Direct evidence of hybrid nature of EUV waves and the reflection of the fast-mode wave

 - **Abstract**
 In current study, we perform the analysis of an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wave on 2022 March 31. The event originated from the from NOAA active region (AR) 12975 (location: N13W52) in the Atmospheric imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) satellite and exactly the west limb in Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-Ahead (STEREO-A) observations. The EUV wave was associated with a GOES medium class i.e. M9.6 eruptive flare. The event was also well observed by MLSO and COR1 coronagraph. For the first time, we found here clear simultaneous observations of two components of EUV wave in AIA as well as in STEREO-A images, which was predicted in EUV wave hybrid model. These components are fast-mode wave and non-wave counterparts. The speed of fast-mode EUV wave in AIA 193 A is ~658$\pm$4 km/s, while the non-wave component propagates with a speed of ~157$\pm$3 km/s. The computed speed in STEREO-A 195 A for the fast-mode wave and non-wave components are ~590$\pm$3 km/s and ~150$\pm$2 km/s, respectively. The EUV wave interaction with AR shows the reflection of it above the solar limb. The speed of the reflected and transmitted wave components are 140 and 180 km/s, which is slower than the incident wave. With the precise alignments, we found the fast-mode EUV wave is just ahead of the coronal mass ejection (CME) and the non-wave component is cospatial with the core of the accompanied CME. In addition to these, the event also shows the stationary fronts and the reflection from the AR located towards the south of the EUV wave origin site.
