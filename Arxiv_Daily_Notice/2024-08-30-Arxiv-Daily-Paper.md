 - **Abstract**
 Ultralight scalars emerge naturally in several motivated particle physics scenarios and are viable candidates for dark matter. While laboratory detection of such bosons is challenging, their existence in nature can be imprinted on measurable properties of astrophysical black holes (BHs). The phenomenon of superradiance can convert the BH spin kinetic energy into a bound cloud of scalars. In this letter, we propose a new technique for directly measuring the mass of a dark cloud around a spinning BH. We compare the measurement of the BH spin obtained with two independent electromagnetic techniques: continuum fitting and iron K$\alpha$ spectroscopy. Since the former technique depends on a dynamical observation of the BH mass while the latter does not, a mismatch between the two measurements can be used to infer the presence of additional extended mass around the BH. We find that a precision of $\sim 1\%$ on the two spin measurements is required to exclude the null hypothesis of no dark mass around the BH at a 2$\sigma$ confidence level for dark masses about a few percent of the BH mass, as motivated in some superradiance scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 The star formation efficiency (SFE) measures the proportion of molecular gas converted into stars, while the star formation rate (SFR) indicates the rate at which gas is transformed into stars. Here we propose such a model in the framework of a global radial collapse of molecular clouds, where the collapse velocity depends on the density profile and the initial mass-to-radius ratio of molecular clouds, with the collapse velocity accelerating during the collapse process. This simplified analytical model allows us to estimate a lifetime of giant molecular clouds of approximately $0.44-7.36 \times 10^7\, \rm{yr}$, and a star formation timescale of approximately $0.5-5.88 \times 10^6\, \rm{yr}$. Additionally, we can predict an SFE of approximately $1.59\, \%$, and an SFR of roughly $1.85\, \rm{M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}}$ for the Milky Way in agreement with observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have begun probing the early phases of disc formation, but little data yet exists on disc structure and morphology of Class 0 objects. Using simulations, we are able to lay out predictions of disc morphologies expected in future surveys of young discs. Based on detailed simulations of ab initio star formation by core collapse, we predict that early discs must be eccentric. In this letter, we study the morphology and, in particular, the eccentricity of discs formed in non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) collapse simulations. We attempt to show that discs formed by cloud collapse are likely to be eccentric. We ran non-ideal MHD collapse simulations in the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES with radiative transfer. We used state-of-the-art analysis methods to measure the disc eccentricity. We find that despite no asymmetry in the initial conditions, the discs formed are eccentric, with eccentricities on the order of 0.1. These results may have important implications for protoplanetary disc dynamics and planet formation. The presence of eccentricity in young discs that is not seen at later stages of disc evolution is in tension with current viscous eccentricity damping models. This implies that there may be an as-yet undiscovered circularisation mechanism in circumstellar discs.
#### Pair Counting without Binning -- A New Approach to Correlation Functions in Clustering Statistics

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a novel perspective on correlation functions in the clustering analysis of the large-scale structure of the universe. We first recognise that pair counting in bins of radial separation is equivalent to evaluating counts-in-cells (CIC), which can be modelled using a filtered density field with a binning-window function. This insight leads to an in situ expression for the two-point correlation function (2PCF). Essentially, the core idea underlying our method is to introduce a window function to define the binning scheme, enabling pair-counting without binning. This approach develops a concept of generalised 2PCF, which extends beyond conventional discrete pair counting by accommodating non-sharp-edged window functions. To extend this framework to N-point correlation functions (NPCF) using current optimal edge-corrected estimators, we developed a binning scheme independent of the specific parameterisation of polyhedral configurations. In particular, we demonstrate a fast algorithm for the three-point correlation function (3PCF), where triplet counting is accomplished by assigning either a spherical tophat or a Gaussian filter to each vertex of triangles. Additionally, we derive analytical expressions for the 3PCF using a multipole expansion in Legendre polynomials, accounting for filtered field (binning) corrections. Numerical tests using several suites of N-body simulation samples show that our approach aligns remarkably well with the theoretical predictions. Our method provides an exact solution for quantifying binning effects in practical measurements and offers a high-speed algorithm, enabling high-order clustering analysis in extremely large datasets from ongoing and upcoming surveys such as Euclid, LSST, and DESI.
#### Emergence of high-mass stars in complex fiber networks (EMERGE) IV. Environmental dependence of the fiber widths

 - **Abstract**
 Despite their variety of scales throughout the interstellar medium, filaments in nearby low-mass clouds show a characteristic width of $\sim$ 0.1 pc from the analysis of {\it Herschel} observations. The origin of this characteristic width, however, has been a matter of intense discussions during the last decade. We explored a possible variation in this typical width with the EMERGE Early ALMA Survey, which includes seven star-forming regions in Orion (OMC-1/-2/-3/-4 South, LDN 1641N, NGC 2023, Flame Nebula). These targets, which exhibit different physical conditions, star formation histories, mass, and density regimes, were homogeneously surveyed at a resolution of $\sim$ 2000 au in N$_2$H$^+$ (1$-$0) with ALMA+IRAM-30m observations. We characterised the column density and temperature radial profiles of the 152 fibers identified in the survey using the automatic fitting routine FilChap. These Orion fibers show a departure from the isothermal condition with significant outward temperature gradients with $\nabla T_\mathrm{K} > 30$ K pc$^{-1}$. They also show a median full width at half maximum ($FWHM$) of $\sim 0.05$ pc, with a corresponding median aspect ratio of $\sim2$. More relevantly, we observe a systematic variation in these fiber $FWHM$ between different regions in our sample, and a direct inverse dependence of these $FWHM$ on their central column density, $N_0$, above $\gtrsim 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. This dependency agrees with the expected $N_0-FWHM$ anti-correlation predicted in previous theoretical studies. Our homogeneous analysis returns the first observational evidence of an intrinsic and systematic variation in the fiber widths across different star-forming regions. While sharing comparable mass, length, and kinematic properties in all of our targets, fibers appear to adjust their $FWHM$ to their density and to the pressure in their host environment.
#### Can gap-edge illumination excite spirals in protoplanetary disks? Three-temperature radiation hydrodynamics and NIR image modelling

 - **Abstract**
 The advent of high-resolution, near-infrared instruments such as VLT/SPHERE and Gemini/GPI has helped uncover a wealth of substructure in planet-forming disks, including large, prominent spiral arms in MWC 758, SAO 206462, and V1247 Ori among others. In the classical theory of disk-planet interaction, these arms are consistent with Lindblad-resonance driving by multi-Jupiter-mass companions. Despite improving detection limits, evidence for such massive bodies in connection with spiral substructure has been inconclusive. In search of an alternative explanation, we use the PLUTO code to run 3D hydrodynamical simulations with two comparatively low planet masses (Saturn-mass, Jupiter-mass) and two thermodynamic prescriptions (three-temperature radiation hydrodynamics, and the more traditional $\beta$-cooling) in a low-mass disk. In the radiative cases, an $m = 2$ mode, potentially attributable to the interaction of stellar radiation with gap-edge asymmetries, creates an azimuthal pressure gradient, which in turn gives rise to prominent spiral arms in the upper layers of the disk. Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) post-processing with RADMC3D reveals that in near-infrared scattered light, these gap-edge spirals are significantly more prominent than the traditional Lindblad spirals for planets in the mass range tested. Our results demonstrate that even intermediate-mass protoplanets -- less detectable, but more ubiquitous, than super-Jupiters -- are capable of indirectly inducing large-scale spiral disk features, and underscore the importance of including radiation physics in efforts to reproduce observations.
#### FRAM Next Generation at the Pierre Auger Observatory: cloud monitoring in the age of CMOS cameras
 - **Authors:** Jan Ebr (for the Pierre Auger Collaboration), Sergey Karpov

 - **Abstract**
 The visibility of stars is often used for cloud detection using all-sky cameras, which have however only a limited reach and resolution near the horizon due to the lack of detectable stars. At the Pierre Auger Observatory, it is also used by the current generation of FRAM robotic telescopes, but -- due to their limited field of view -- only for a small number of selected showers. Thanks to the recent development in astronomical CMOS cameras, we are able to propose a new type of device, specifically tailored to the field of view of the fluorescence detectors (FD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The sub-second readout times available with CMOS cameras allows the efficient use of short exposures, and so the field of view of one FD can be covered within half a minute with a resolution and reach sufficient to detect small clouds with a setup that is significantly smaller, simpler and cheaper than the current FRAMs. The FRAM Next Generation (framNG) device will be able not only to detect clouds, but also to assess their optical thickness, provide information on aerosol extinction, sky brightness and possibly even record atmospheric phenomena and astrophysical transients. The main challenge lies in the large data volume produced which necessitates reliable real-time data processing.
#### A VLA Study of Newly-Discovered Southern Latitude Non-Thermal Filaments in the Galactic Center: Polarimetric and Magnetic Field Properties

 - **Abstract**
 A population of structures unique to the Galactic Center (GC), known as the non-thermal filaments (NTFs), has been studied for over 40 years, but much remains unknown about them. In particular, there is no widely-accepted and unified understanding for how the relativistic electrons illuminating these structures are generated. One possibility is that there are compact and extended sources of Cosmic Rays (CRs), which then diffuse along magnetic flux tubes leading to the illumination of the NTFs through synchrotron emission. In this work, we present and discuss the polarimetric distributions associated with a set of faint NTFs in the GC that have only been studied in total intensity previously. We compare the derived polarized intensity, rotation measure, and intrinsic magnetic field distributions for these structures with the results obtained for previously observed GC NTFs. The results are then used to enhance our understanding of the large-scale polarimetric properties of the GC. We then use the derived polarimetric distributions to constrain models for the mechanisms generating the relativistic electrons that illuminate these structures.
