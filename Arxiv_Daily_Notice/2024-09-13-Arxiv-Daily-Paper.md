 - **Abstract**
 CIZA J2242.8+5301, or the Sausage cluster, is well studied over a range of frequencies. Since its first discovery, a lot of interesting features and unique characteristics have been uncovered. In this work, we report some more new morphological features using the uGMRT band-3 and band-4 data. In the north relic, we observe variation in spectral index profiles across the relic width from the east to west, which may indicate a decrease in downstream cooling rate in that direction. We re-confirm the presence of an additional ~ 930 kpc relic in the north. We classify the filamentary source in the downstream region to be a narrow angle tail (NAT) radio galaxy. The bright arc in the east relic shows sub-structure in the spectral index profile, which may indicate the presence of finer filaments. We further report the presence of a double-strand structure in the east relic similar to the 'Toothbrush' relic. We categorize the bright 'L' shaped structure in the southern relic to be a NAT radio galaxy, as well as trace the actual ~ 1.1 Mpc relic component. We re-confirm the existence of the faint southern extent, measuring the relic length to be ~ 1.8 Mpc. Furthermore, we suggest the southern relic to be a union of individual component relics rather than a single giant filamentary relic. Lastly, based on the morphological symmetry between northern and southern relics, we suggest a schematic shock structure associated with the merger event in an attempt to explain their formation scenario.
#### A survey of extremely metal-poor gas at cosmic noon: evidence of elevated [O/Fe]

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to study the high-precision chemical abundances of metal-poor gas clouds at cosmic noon (2<z<4) and investigate the associated enrichment histories. We analyse the abundances of four newly discovered metal-poor gas clouds utilising observations conducted with Keck/HIRES and VLT/UVES. These systems are classified as very metal-poor (VMP), with [Fe/H]<-2.57, and one system qualifies as an extremely metal-poor (EMP) Damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) system with [Fe/H]=-3.13+/-0.06. In combination with new high-resolution data of two previously known EMP DLAs and 2 systems reported in the literature, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of eight of the most metal-poor gas clouds currently known. We focus on high-precision abundance measurements using the elements: C, N, O, Al, Si, and Fe. Our findings indicate increasing evidence of elevated [O/Fe] abundances when [Fe/H]<-3. EMP DLAs are well-modelled with a mean value of [O/Fe]=+0.50 +/- 0.04 and an intrinsic scatter of $\sigma_{int,[O/Fe]}=0.13^{+0.06}_{-0.04}$. While VMP DLAs are well-modelled with [O/Fe]=+0.40 +/- 0.02 and $\sigma_{int,[O/Fe]}$=0.06 +/- 0.02. We further find tentative evidence of a redshift evolution of [C/O] across these most metal-poor DLAs with lower redshift systems showing elevated [C/O] ratios. Using the measured abundances, combined with a stochastic chemical enrichment model, we investigate the properties of the stellar population responsible for enriching EMP gas at cosmic noon. We find that the chemistry of these systems is best explained via the enrichment of just two massive progenitors, N_*=2+/-1, that ended their lives as core collapse SNe with a typical explosion energy E_exp=(1.6 +/- 0.6)x10$^{51}$ erg. These progenitors formed obeying a Salpeter-like power-law IMF, where all stars of mass greater than M_max=32$^{+10}_{-4}$ M_sun collapse directly to black holes and do not contribute to the metal enrichment.
#### Nightside Clouds on Tidally-locked Terrestrial Planets Mimic Atmosphere-Free Scenarios

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of nightside cloud formation on the observable night-day contrast of tidally-locked terrestrial planet atmospheres. We demonstrate that, in the case where the planetary dayside is only 10s of Kelvin hotter than the planetary nightside, the presence of optically thick nightside clouds can lead to observations that mimic a planet without an atmosphere, despite the planet actually hosting a significant (10 bar) atmosphere. The scenario presented in this work requires a level of intrinsic atmospheric day/night temperature contrast such that the nightside can form clouds while the dayside is too hot for cloud formation to occur. This scenario is most likely for hotter terrestrials and terrestrials with low volatile inventories. We thus note that a substantial dayside/nightside temperature difference alone does not robustly indicate that a planet does not host an atmosphere and additional observations and modeling are essential for characterization. We further discuss several avenues for future study to improve our understanding of the terrestrial planets and how best to characterize them with JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 Blanco 1 is an $\approx 130\,\mathrm{Myr}$ open cluster located 240 pc from the Sun below the Galactic plane. Recent studies have reported the existence of diffuse tidal tails extending 50-60 pc from the cluster center based on the positions and velocities measured by Gaia. To independently assess the reality and extent of this structure, we used light curves generated from TESS full-frame images to search for photometric rotation periods of stars in and around Blanco 1. We detected rotation periods down to a stellar effective temperature of $\approx 3100\,\mathrm{K}$ in 347 of the 603 cluster member candidates for which we have light curves. For cluster members in the core and candidate members in the tidal tails, both within a temperature range of 4400 to 6200 K, 74% and 72% of the rotation periods are consistent with the single-star gyrochronological sequence, respectively. In contrast, a comparison sample of field stars yielded gyrochrone-consistent rotation periods for only 8.5% of stars. The tidal tail candidates' overall conformance to the core members' gyrochrone sequence implies that their contamination ratio is consistent with zero and < 0.33 at the $2\sigma$ level. This result confirms the existence of Blanco 1 tidal tails and doubles the number of Blanco 1 members for which there are both spatio-kinematic and rotation-based cluster membership verification. Extending the strategy of using TESS light curves for gyrochronology to other nearby young open clusters and stellar associations may provide a viable strategy for mapping out their dissolution and broadening the search for young exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a JWST NIRSpec transmission spectrum of the super-Earth exoplanet L 98-59 c. This small (R$_p=1.385\pm0.085$R$_\oplus$, M$_p=2.22\pm0.26$R$_\oplus$), warm (T$_\textrm{eq}=553$K) planet resides in a multi-planet system around a nearby, bright (J = 7.933) M3V star. We find that the transmission spectrum of L 98-59 c is featureless at the precision of our data. We achieve precisions of 22ppm in NIRSpec G395H's NRS1 detector and 36ppm in the NRS2 detector at a resolution R$\sim$200 (30 pixel wide bins). At this level of precision, we are able rule out primordial H$_2$-He atmospheres across a range of cloud pressure levels up to at least $\sim$0.1mbar. By comparison to atmospheric forward models, we also rule out atmospheric metallicities below $\sim$300$\times$ solar at 3$\sigma$ (or equivalently, atmospheric mean molecular weights below $\sim$10~g/mol). We also rule out pure methane atmospheres. The remaining scenarios that are compatible with our data include a planet with no atmosphere at all, or higher mean-molecular weight atmospheres, such as CO$_2$- or H$_2$O-rich atmospheres. This study adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that planets $\lesssim1.5$R$_\oplus$ lack extended atmospheres.
#### Supernova remnants in clumpy medium: A model of hydrodynamic and radio synchrotron evolution

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analytical model of $\Sigma-D$ relation for supernova remnants (SNRs) evolving in a clumpy medium. The model and its approximations were developed using the hydrodynamic simulations of SNRs in environments of low-density bubbles and clumpy media with different densities and volume-filling factors. For calculation of SNR luminosities we developed the synchrotron emission model, implying the test-particle approximation. The goal of this work is to explain the flattened part of $\Sigma-D$ relation for Galactic SNRs at $D\approx14-50$ pc. Our model shows that the shock collision with the clumpy medium initially enhances the brightness of individual SNRs, which is followed by a steeper fall of their $\Sigma-D$ curve. We used the analytical model to generate large SNR samples on $\Sigma-D$ plane, within a span of different densities and distances to clumpy medium, keeping the observed distribution of diameters. After comparison with the Galactic sample, we conclude that the observed $\Sigma-D$ flattening and scatter originates in sporadic emission jumps of individual SNRs while colliding with the dense clumps. Statistically, the significant impact of the clumps starts at diameters of $\approx14$ pc, up to $\sim70$ pc, with the average density jump at clumpy medium of $\sim2-20$ times, roughly depending on the low density of circumstellar region. However, additional analysis considering the selection effects is needed, as well as the improvement of the model, considering radiation losses and thermal conduction.

 - **Abstract**
 The joint gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic observations of the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 marked a giant leap in multi-messenger astrophysics. The extensive observation campaign of the associated Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) and its afterglow has strengthened the hypothesis associating GRBs with BNS mergers and provided insights on mass ejection, particularly the relativistic outflow launched in BNS mergers. In this paper, we investigate the joint detection probabilities of BNS mergers by GW detectors and the upcoming ground-based very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray instrument, the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). Using an empirical relation that constrains the distance-inclination angle plane, we simulated BNS mergers detectable in the O5 run of the LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (LVK) network with $300$~Mpc BNS horizon. Assuming Gaussian structured jets and ignoring large sky localization challenges of GW detectors, we estimated VHE afterglow detection probability by CTA. We have explored the afterglow parameter space to identify conditions favourable for detecting synchrotron self-Compton emission by CTA. Our study reveals that events viewed at angles $\lesssim3$ times the jet core angle are detectable by CTA when the initial bulk Lorentz factor at the jet axis ranges between 100 and 800. We find high kinetic energy ($E_k>10^{50}$ erg), ambient density ($n_0>10^{-1}$ $cm^{-3}$), and energy content in non-thermal electrons significantly enhance the likelihood of CTA detection within 300 Mpc. The joint detection rate varies significantly with afterglow parameter distributions, ranging from $0.003$ to $0.5$ per year.

 - **Abstract**
 Global expansion of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) will see the strategic addition of antennas at new geographical locations, transforming the sensitivity and imaging fidelity of the $\lambda \sim 1\,$mm EHT array. A possible South African EHT station would leverage a strong geographical advantage, local infrastructure, and radio astronomy expertise, and have strong synergies with the Africa Millimetre Telescope in Namibia. We assessed three South African candidate millimetre sites using climatological simulations and found at least two promising sites. These sites are comparable to some existing EHT stations during the typical April EHT observing window and outperform them during most of the year, especially the southern hemisphere winter. Interferometric simulations of Africa-enhanced EHT arrays under the simulated atmospheric conditions demonstrate the improved array performance. In typical weather, the number of reliable visibility detections increased considerably, especially at $(u, v)$-distances corresponding to the angular sizes of the Sagittarius A$^*$ and Messier 87$^*$ black hole shadow diameters ($\sim40\,\mathrm{\mu}$as to $50\,\mathrm{\mu}$as). The simulation results underscore the sizable, positive impact of a strategically placed South African EHT station on ngEHT objectives and the resulting black hole science.
#### Massive Star Formation Starts in Sub-virial Dense Clumps Unless Resisted by Strong Magnetic Fields

 - **Abstract**
 The initial conditions are critical for understanding high-mass star formation, but are not well observed. Built on our previous characterization of a Galaxy-wide sample of 463 candidate high-mass starless clumps (HMSCs), here we investigate the dynamical state of a representative subsample of 44 HMSCs (radii 0.13-1.12 pc) using GBT NH3 (1,1) and (2,2) data from the Radio Ammonia Mid-Plane Survey (RAMPS) pilot data release. By fitting the two NH3 lines simultaneously, we obtain velocity dispersion, gas kinetic temperature, NH3 column density and abundance, Mach number, and virial parameter. Thermodynamic analysis reveals that most HMSCs have Mach number $<$5, inconsistent to what have been considered in theoretical models. All but one (43/44) of the HMSCs are gravitationally bound with virial parameter $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}} < 2$. Either these massive clumps are in collapsing or magnetic field strengths of 0.10-2.65 mG (average 0.51 mG) would be needed to support them against collapsing. The estimated B-field strength correlates tightly with density, $B_{\rm est}/{\rm mG}=0.269\,(n_{\rm H_2}/10^4\,{\rm cm^{-3}})^{0.61}$, with a similar power-law index as found in observations, but a factor of 4.6 higher in strength. For the first time, the initial dynamical state of high-mass formation regions has been statistically constrained to be sub-virial, in contradictory to theoretical models in virial equilibrium, and in agreement with the lack of observed massive starless cores. The findings urge future observations to quantify the magnetic field support in the prestellar stage of massive clumps, which are rarely explored so far, towards a full understanding of the physical conditions that initiate massive star formation.
