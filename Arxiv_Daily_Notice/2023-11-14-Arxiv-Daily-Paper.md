#### Interferometric Image Reconstruction using Closure Invariants and  Machine Learning

 - **Abstract**
 Closure invariants in interferometry carry calibration-independent information about the morphology of an observed object. Excepting simple cases, a mapping between closure invariants and morphologies is not well established. We aim to demonstrate that closure invariants can be used to classify the morphology and estimate the morphological parameters using simple Machine Learning models. We consider 6 morphological classes -- point-like, uniform circular disc, crescent, dual disc, crescent with elliptical accretion disc, and crescent with double jet lobes -- described by phenomenological parameters. Using simple logistic regression, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network, and random forest models on closure invariants obtained from a sparse aperture coverage, we find that all models except logistic regression are able to classify the morphology with an $F_1$ score $\gtrsim 0.8$. The classification accuracy notably improves with greater aperture coverage. We also estimate morphological parameters of uniform circular disc, crescent, and dual disc using simple MLP models, and perform a parametric image reconstruction. The reconstructed images do not retain information about absolute position or intensity scale. The estimated parameters and reconstructed images are found to correspond well with the inputs. However, the prediction accuracy worsens with increasing morphological complexity. This proof-of-concept method opens an independent approach to interferometric imaging under challenging observing conditions such as that faced by the Event Horizon Telescope and Very Long Baseline Interferometry in general, and can complement other methods to robustly constrain an object's morphology.

 - **Abstract**
 Super Soft X-ray Sources (SSS) are white dwarf (WD) binaries that radiate almost entirely below $\sim$1~keV. Their X-ray spectra are often complex when viewed with the X-ray grating spectrometers, where numerous emission and absorption features are intermingled and hard to separate. The absorption features are mostly from the WD atmosphere, for which radiative transfer models have been constructed. The emission features are from the corona surrounding the WD atmosphere, in which incident emission from the WD surface is reprocessed. Modeling the corona requires different solvers and assumptions for the radiative transfer, which is yet to be achieved. We chose CAL87, a SSS in the Large Magellanic Cloud, which exhibits emission-dominated spectra from the corona as the WD atmosphere emission is assumed to be completely blocked by the accretion disk. We constructed a radiative transfer model for the corona using the two radiative transfer codes; xstar for a one-dimensional two-stream solver and MONACO for a three-dimensional Monte Carlo solver. We identified their differences and limitations in comparison to the spectra taken with the Reflection Grating Spectrometer onboard the XMM-Newton satellite. We finally obtained a sufficiently good spectral model of CAL87 based on the radiative transfer of the corona plus an additional collisionally ionized plasma. In the coming X-ray microcalorimeter era, it will be required to interpret spectra based on radiative transfer in a wider range of sources than what is presented here.
#### Star formation history of the post-collisional Cartwheel galaxy using  Astrosat/UVIT FUV images

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results obtained by analysing new Astrosat/UVIT far ultraviolet (FUV) image of the collisional-ring galaxy Cartwheel. The FUV emission is principally associated with the star-forming outer ring, with no UV detection from the nucleus and inner ring. A few sources are detected in the region between the inner and the outer rings, all of which lie along the spokes. The FUV fluxes from the detected sources are combined with aperture-matched multi-band photometric data from archival images to explore the post-collision star formation history of the Cartwheel. The data were corrected for extinction using Av derived from the Balmer decrement ratios and commonly used extinction curves. We find that the ring regions contain stellar populations of wide range of ages, with the bulk of the FUV emission coming from non-ionizing stars, formed over the last 20 to 150 Myr, that are ~25 times more massive than the ionizing populations. On the other hand, regions belonging to the spokes have negligible current star formation, with the age of the dominant older population systematically increasing as its distance from the outer ring increases. The presence of populations of a wide range of ages in the ring suggests that the stars formed in the wave in the past were dragged along it to the current position of the ring. We derive an average steady star formation rate, SFR=5 Msun/yr, over the past 150 Myr, with an increase to ~18 Msun/yr in the recent 10 Myr.

 - **Abstract**
 The lateral density data obtained for different secondaries of an extensive air shower (EAS) from an array of detectors are usually described by some suitable lateral density functions (LDFs). Analyzing non-vertical simulated EASs generated with the CORSIKA code, it is found that the lateral and polar density distributions of electrons and muons are asymmetric in the ground plane. It means that typical expressions for symmetric lateral density functions (SLDFs) (\emph{e.g.} the Nishimura-Kamata-Greisen function) are inadequate to reconstruct the lateral and polar dependencies of such asymmetric electron or muon densities accurately. In order to provide a more consistent LDF for non-vertical shower reconstruction in the ground plane, the paper considers the issue of the modification of the SLDF analytically. The asymmetry arising from additional attenuation and correction of the positional coordinates (radial and polar) of cascade particles causes a gap length between the center of concentric equidensity ellipses and the EAS core. A toy function is introduced as a basic LDF to describe the asymmetric lateral and polar density distributions of electrons or muons of EASs, thereby predicting the gap length parameter. Consequently, the desired LDF describing the asymmetric density distributions of electrons and muons of EASs has emerged. We compare results from detailed simulations with the predictions of the analytical parametrization. The LDF derived in this work is found to be well-suited to reconstruct EASs in the ground plane directly.
#### Rethinking Thorne-Żytkow Object Formation: The Fate of X-ray Binary  LMC X-4 and Implications for Ultra-long Gamma-ray Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 We present a start-to-end simulation aimed at studying the long-term fate of high mass X-ray binaries and whether a Thorne-\.Zytkow object (T\.ZO) might ultimately be produced. We analyze results from a 3D hydrodynamical simulation that models the eventual fate of LMC X-4, a compact high mass X-ray binary system, after the primary fills its Roche lobe and engulfs the neutron star companion. We discuss the outcome of this engulfment within the standard paradigm of T\.ZO formation. The post-merger angular momentum content of the stellar core is a key ingredient, as even a small amount of rotation can break spherical symmetry and produce a centrifugally supported accretion disk. Our findings suggest the inspiraling neutron star, upon merging with the core, can accrete efficiently via a disk at high rates ($\approx 10^{-2}M_\odot/{\rm s}$), subsequently collapsing into a black hole and triggering a bright transient with a luminosity and duration typical of an ultra-long gamma-ray burst. We propose that the canonical framework for T\.ZO formation via common envelope needs to be revised, as the significant post-merger accretion feedback will unavoidably unbind the vast majority of the surrounding envelope.
#### Progenitor constraint using line ratios of the CNO elements in supernova  remnants

 - **Abstract**
 Unveiling the nature of progenitors is crucial for understanding the origin and the mechanism of core-collapse and thermonuclear supernovae (SNe). While several methods have been developed to derive stellar properties so far, many questions remain poorly understood. In this paper we demonstrate an observational approach to constrain progenitors of supernova remnants (SNRs) using abundances of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) in shock-heated circumstellar material (CSM). Our calculations with stellar evolution codes indicate that a total amount of these CNO elements will provide a more sensitive determination of the progenitor masses than the conventional method based on ejecta abundances. If the CNO lines (particularly those of C and N) are detected and measured their abundance ratios accurately, they can provide relatively robust constraint on the progenitor mass (and in some cases the rotation velocity) of SNRs. Since our method requires a better energy resolution and larger effective area in the soft X-ray band ($<1$~keV), XRISM launched on September 7, 2023 and next-generation microcalorimeter missions such as Athena, Lynx, LEM, and HUBS will bring a new insight into link between the progenitors and their remnants.
#### Red Giant Rotational Inversion Kernels Need Nonlinear Surface  Corrections

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroseismology is our only means of measuring stellar rotation in their interiors, rather than at their surfaces. Some techniques for measurements of this kind -- "rotational inversions" -- require the shapes of linear response kernels computed from reference stellar models to be representative of those in the stars they are intended to match. This is not the case in evolved stars exhibiting gravitoacoustic mixed modes: we show that the action of the asteroseismic surface term -- systematic errors in the modelling of near-surface layers -- changes the shapes of their inversion kernels. Corrections for the surface term are not ordinarily considered necessary for rotational inversions. We show how this may have caused previous estimates of red-giant envelope rotation rates from mixed-mode asteroseismic inversions to have been unintentionally contaminated by core rotation as a result, with errors comparable to the entire reported estimates. We derive a mitigation procedure for this hitherto unaccounted systematic error, and demonstrate its viability and effectiveness. We recommend this mitigation be applied when revising existing rotational inversions. Finally, we discuss both the prospects for applying such mitigation to the harder problem of inversions for stellar structure (rather than rotation), as well as the broader implications of this systematic error with regards to the longstanding problem of internal angular momentum transport.

 - **Abstract**
 Planetary systems around solar analogs inform us about how planets form and evolve in Solar System-like environments. We report the detection and characterization of two planetary systems around the solar analogs TOI-1736 and TOI-2141 using TESS photometry data and spectroscopic data obtained with the SOPHIE instrument on the 1.93 m telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence (OHP). We performed a detailed spectroscopic analysis of these systems to obtain the precise radial velocities (RV) and physical properties of their host stars. TOI-1736 and TOI-2141 each host a transiting sub-Neptune with radii of $2.44\pm0.18$ R$_{\oplus}$ and $3.05\pm0.23$ R$_{\oplus}$, orbital periods of $7.073088(7)$ d and $18.26157(6)$ d, and masses of $12.8\pm1.8$ M$_{\oplus}$ and $24\pm4$ M$_{\oplus}$, respectively. TOI-1736 shows long-term RV variations that are consistent with a two-planet solution plus a linear trend of $-0.177$ ms$^{-1}$d$^{-1}$. We measured an RV semi-amplitude of $201.1\pm0.7$ ms$^{-1}$ for the outer companion, TOI-1736 c, implying a projected mass of $m_{c}\sin{i}=8.09\pm0.20$ M$_{\rm Jup}$. From the GAIA DR3 astrometric excess noise, we constrained the mass of TOI-1736 c at $8.7^{+1.5}_{-0.6}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$. This planet is in an orbit of $570.2\pm0.6$ d with an eccentricity of $0.362\pm0.003$ and a semi-major axis of $1.381\pm0.017$ au, where it receives a flux of $0.71\pm0.08$ times the bolometric flux incident on Earth, making it an interesting case of a supergiant planet that has settled into an eccentric orbit in the habitable zone of a solar analog. Our analysis of the mass-radius relation for the transiting sub-Neptunes shows that both TOI-1736 b and TOI-2141 b likely have an Earth-like dense rocky core and a water-rich envelope.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary stars are believed to be key determinants in understanding globular cluster evolution. In this paper, we present the Multi-band photometric analyses of five variables in the nearest galactic globular cluster M4, from the observations of CASE, M4 Core Project with HST for four variables (V48, V49, V51, and V55) and the data collected from T40 and C18 Telescopes of Wise Observatory for one variable (NV4). The light curves of five binaries are analyzed using the Wilson-Devinney method (WD) and their fundamental parameters have been derived. A period variation study was carried out using times of minima obtained from the literature for four binaries and the nature of the variation observed is discussed. The evolutionary state of systems is evaluated using M-R diagram, correlating with that of a few well-studied close binaries in other globular clusters. Based on the data obtained from the Gaia DR3 database, a three-dimensional Vector-Point Diagrams (VPD) was built to evaluate the cluster membership of the variables, and two out of them (V49 and NV4) were found to be not cluster members.
#### Swift, NuSTAR, and INTEGRAL observations of the symbiotic X-ray binary  IGR J16194-2810

 - **Abstract**
 We report on a simultaneous observational campaign with both Swift/XRT and NuSTAR targeting the symbiotic X-ray binary IGR J16194-2810. The main goal of the campaign was to investigate the possible presence of cyclotron scattering absorption features in the broad-band spectrum of the source, and help advance our understanding of the process of neutron star formation via the accretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf. The 1-30 keV spectrum of the source, as measured during our campaign, did not reveal the presence of any statistically significant absorption feature. The spectrum could be well described using a model comprising a thermal black-body hot component, most likely emerging from the surface of the accreting neutron star, and a power-law with no measurable cut-off energy (and affected by a modest absorption column density). Compared to previous analyses in the literature, we could rule out the presence of a colder thermal component emerging from an accretion disk, compatible with the idea that IGR J16194-2810 is a wind-fed binary (as most of the symbiotic X-ray binaries). Our results were strengthened by exploiting the archival XRT and INTEGRAL data, extending the validity of the spectral model used up to 0.3-40 keV and demonstrating that IGR J16194-2810 is unlikely to undergo significant spectral variability over time in the X-ray domain.
#### The disk of the eruptive protostar V900 Mon; a MATISSE/VLTI and MUSE/VLT  perspective

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we study the silicate dust content in the disk of one of the youngest eruptive stars, V900 Mon, at the highest angular resolution probing down to the inner 10 au of said disk, and study the historical evolution of the system traced in part by a newly discovered emission clump. We performed high-angular resolution mid-infrared interferometric observations of V900 Mon with MATISSE/VLTI with a spatial coverage ranging from 38-m to 130-m baselines, and compared them to archival MIDI/VLTI data. We also mined and re-analyzed archival optical and infrared photometry of the star to study its long-term evolution since its eruption in the 1990s. We complemented our findings with integral field spectroscopy data from MUSE/VLT. The MATISSE/VLTI data suggest a radial variation of the silicate feature in the dusty disk, whereby at large spatial scales ($\geq10$ au) the protostellar disk's emission is dominated by large-sized ($\geq1\,\mu m$) silicate grains, while at smaller spatial scales and closer to the star ($\leq5$ au), silicate emission is absent suggesting self-shielding. We propose that the self-shielding may be the result of small dust grains at the base of the collimated CO outflow previously detected by ALMA. A newly discovered knot in the MUSE/VLT data, located at a projected distance approximately 27,000 au from the star, is co-aligned with the molecular gas outflow at a P.A. of $250^o$ ($\pm5^o$) consistent with the position angle and inclination of the disk. The knot is seen in emission in H$\alpha$, [N II], and the [S II] doublet and its kinematic age is about 5150 years. This ejected material could originate from a previous eruption.
#### Coupling haze and cloud microphysics in WASP-39b's atmosphere based on  JWST observations

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07365
 - **Abstract**
 We present a study on the coupling of haze and clouds in the atmosphere of WASP-39b. We developed a cloud microphysics model simulating the formation of Na2S and MgSiO3 condensates over photochemical hazes in gas giant atmospheres. We apply this model to WASP-39b, recently observed with the JWST to study how these heterogeneous components may affect the transit spectrum. We simulate both morning and evening terminators independently and average their transit spectra. While MgSiO3 formation has negligible impact on the spectrum, Na2S condensates produce gray opacities in the water band, in agreement with HST and JWST observations. Moreover, the formation of Na2S on the morning side depletes the atmosphere of its sodium content, decreasing the strength of the Na line. Combining morning and evening profiles results in a good fit of the Na observations. These nominal results assume a small Na2S/haze contact angle (5.7{\deg}). Using a larger value (61{\deg}) reduces the cloud density and opacity, but the effect on the Na profile and spectral line remains identical. In addition, the presence of haze in the upper atmosphere reproduces the UV-visible slope observed in the HST and VLT data and contributes to the opacity between the water bands at wavelengths below 2 microns. The averaged spectra are rather insensitive to the variation of eddy diffusion and haze mass flux tested in this study, though the UV-visible slope, probing the haze layer above the clouds, is affected. Finally, our disequilibrium chemistry model, including photochemistry, reproduces the SO2 and CO2 absorption features observed.
#### Multi-wavelength Campaign Observations of a Young Solar-type Star, EK  Draconis I. Discovery of Prominence Eruptions Associated with Superflares

 - **Abstract**
 Young solar-type stars frequently produce superflares, serving as a unique window into the young Sun-Earth environments. Large solar flares are closely linked to coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with filament/prominence eruptions, but its observational evidence for stellar superflares remains scarce. Here, we present a 12-day multi-wavelength campaign observation of young solar-type star EK Draconis (G1.5V, 50-120 Myr age) utilizing TESS, NICER, and Seimei telescope. The star has previously exhibited blueshifted H$\alpha$ absorptions as evidence for a filament eruption associated with a superflare. Our simultaneous optical and X-ray observations identified three superflares of $1.5\times10^{33}$ -- $1.2\times10^{34}$ erg. We report the first discovery of two prominence eruptions on a solar-type star, observed as blueshifted H$\alpha$ emissions at speed of 690 and 430 km s$^{-1}$ and masses of $1.1\times10^{19}$ and $3.2\times10^{17}$ g, respectively. The faster, massive event shows a candidate of post-flare X-ray dimming with the amplitude of up to $\sim$10 \%. Several observational aspects consistently point to the occurrence of a fast CME associated with this event. The comparative analysis of the estimated length scales of flare loops, prominences, possible dimming region, and starspots provides the overall picture of the eruptive phenomena. Furthermore, the energy partition of the observed superflares in the optical and X-ray bands is consistent with flares from the Sun, M-dwarfs, and close binaries, yielding the unified empirical relations. These discoveries provide profound implications of impact of these eruptive events on the early Venus, Earth and Mars and young exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 The very high energy gamma-ray source HESS J1809-193 has been detected by the LHAASO and HAWC observatory beyond 100 TeV energy. It is an interesting candidate for exploring the underlying mechanisms of gamma-ray production due to the presence of supernova remnants, pulsar and molecular clouds close to it. We have considered the injection of the energetic cosmic rays from a past explosion, whose reminiscent may be SNR G011.0-00.0, which is located within the extended gamma-ray source HESS J1809-193. We explain the multi-wavelength data from the region of HESS J1809-193 with synchrotron, inverse Compton, bremsstrahlung emission of cosmic ray electrons and secondary gamma-ray production in interactions of cosmic ray protons with the cold protons in the local molecular clouds within a time-dependent framework including the diffusion loss of cosmic rays. The observational data has been modelled with the secondary photons produced by the time-evolved cosmic ray spectrum, assuming the age of the explosion is 4500 years.
#### The eROSITA view of the Abell 3391/95 field: Cluster Outskirts and  Filaments

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We aim to characterize the gas properties in the cluster outskirts ($R_{500}<r<R_{200}$) and in the detected inter-cluster filaments ($>R_{200}$) of the A3391/95 system and to compare them to predictions. Methods. We performed X-ray image and spectral analyses using the eROSITA PV data to assess the gas morphology and properties in the outskirts and the filaments in the directions of the previously detected Northern and Southern Filament of the A3391/95 system. We took particular care of the foreground. Results. In the filament-facing outskirts of A3391 and the Northern Clump, we find higher temperatures than typical cluster outskirts profiles, with a significance of $1.6-2.8\sigma$, suggesting heating due to their connections with the filaments. We confirm SB excess in the profiles of the Northern, Eastern, and Southern Filaments. From spectral analysis, we detect hot gas of ~1 keV for the Northern and Southern Filaments. The filament metallicities are below 10% solar metallicity and the $n_e$ range between 2.6 and $6.3\times10^{-5}~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. The characteristic properties of the Little Southern Clump (~1.5$R_{200}$ from A3395S in the Southern Filament) suggest that it is a small galaxy group. Excluding the LSC from the analysis of the Southern Filament decreases the gas density by 30%. This shows the importance of taking into account any clumps to avoid overestimation of the gas measurement in the outskirts and filament regions. Conclusions. The $n_e$ of the filaments are consistent with the WHIM properties as predicted by cosmological simulations, but the temperatures are higher, close to the upper WHIM temperature limit. As both filaments are short and located in a denser environment, stronger gravitational heating may be responsible for this temperature enhancement. The metallicities are low, but still within the expected range from the simulations.
