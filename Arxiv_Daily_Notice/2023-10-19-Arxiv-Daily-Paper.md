#### Some stars fade quietly: Varied Supernova explosion outcomes and their  effects on the multi-phase interstellar medium

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from galaxy evolution simulations with a mutiphase Interstellar medium (ISM), a mass resolution of $4$ M$_{\odot}$ and a spatial resolution of 0.5 pc. These simulations include a stellar feedback model that includes the resolved feedback from individual massive stars and accounts for heating from the far UV-field, non-equilibrium cooling and chemistry and photoionization. In the default setting, individual supernova (SN) remnants are realized as thermal injections of $10^{51}$ erg; this is our reference simulation WLM-fid. Among the remaining seven simulations, there are two runs where we vary this number by fixing the energy at $10^{50}$ erg and $10^{52}$ erg (WLM-1e50 and WLM-1e52, respectively). We carry out three variations with variable SN-energy based on the data of Sukhbold et al. (2016) (WLM-variable, WLM-variable-lin, and WLM-variable-stoch). We run two simulations where only 10 or 60 percent of stars explode as SNe with $10^{51}$ erg, while the remaining stars do not explode (WLM-60prob and WLM-10prob). We find that the variation in the SN-energy, based on the tables of Sukhbold et al. (2016), has only minor effects: the star formation rate changes by roughly a factor of two compared to the fiducial run, and the strength of the galactic outflows in mass and energy only decreases by roughly 30 percent, with typical values of $\eta_m \sim 0.1$ and $\eta_e \sim 0.05$ (measured at a height of 3 kpc after the hot wind is fully decoupled from the galactic ISM). In contrast, the increase and decrease in the canonical SN-energy has a clear impact on the phase structure, with loading factors that are at least 10 times lower/higher and a clear change in the phase structure. We conclude that these slight modulations are driven not by the minor change in SN-energy but rather by the stochasticity of whether or not an event occurs when variable SN-energies are applied.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study S K-edge using high-resolution HETGS {\it Chandra} spectra of 36 low-mas X-ray binaries. For each source, we have estimated column densities for {\rm S}~{\sc i}, {\rm S}~{\sc ii}, {\rm S}~{\sc iii}, {\rm S}~{\sc xiv}, {\rm S}~{\sc xv} and {\rm S}~{\sc xvi} ionic species, which trace the neutral, warm and hot phases of the Galactic interstellar medium. We also estimated column densities for a sample of interstellar dust analogs. We measured their distribution as a function of Galactic latitude, longitude, and distances to the sources. While the cold-warm column densities tend to decrease with the Galactic latitude, we found no correlation with distances or Galactic longitude. This is the first detailed analysis of the sulfur K-edge absorption due to ISM using high-resolution X-ray spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming 21 cm intensity mapping experiments like the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) hold significant potential to constrain the properties of dark matter. In this work, we model neutral hydrogen (HI) distributions using high-resolution hydrodynamical $N$-body simulations of both cold dark matter (CDM) and fuzzy dark matter (FDM) cosmologies in the post-reionization redshift range of $z=3.42-4.94$. We show that the HI abundance and the HI column density distribution function decrease in FDM-like cosmologies. Extreme FDM models with $m\sim 10^{-22}$ eV are at odds with a range of measurements. Due to the increased halo bias, the HI bias increases, paralleled by the damped \Lya \ (DLA) bias which we infer from the cross-section of DLAs. The DLA cross-section distribution in extreme FDM models has a high median at the low-mass end, which can be traced to the high column density of cosmic filaments. We study the prospects of detecting the brightest HI peaks with SKA1-Low at $z=4.94$, indicating moderate signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) at angular resolution $\theta_A = 2^{\prime}$ with a rapidly declining SNR for lower values of $\theta_{A}$. After training the conditional normalizing flow network HIGlow on 2D HI maps, we interpolate its latent space of axion masses to predict the peak flux for a new, synthetic FDM cosmology, finding good agreement with expectations. This work thus underscores the potential of normalizing flows in capturing complex, non-linear structures within HI maps, offering a versatile tool for conditional sample generation and prediction tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 According to observations and numerical simulations, the Milky Way could exhibit several spiral arm modes with multiple pattern speeds, wherein the slower patterns are located at larger Galactocentric distances. Our aim is to quantify the effects of the spiral arms on the azimuthal variations of the chemical abundances for oxygen, iron and for the first time for neutron-capture elements (europium and barium) in the Galactic disc. We assume a model based on multiple spiral arm modes with different pattern speeds. The resulting model represents an updated version of previous 2D chemical evolution models. We apply new analytical prescriptions for the spiral arms in a 2D Galactic disc chemical evolution model, exploring the possibility that the spiral structure is formed by the overlap of chunks with different pattern speeds and spatial extent. The predicted azimuthal variations in abundance gradients are dependent on the considered chemical element. Elements synthesised on short time scales (i.e., oxygen and europium in this study) exhibit larger abundance fluctuations. In fact, for progenitors with short lifetimes, the chemical elements restored into the ISM perfectly trace the star formation perturbed by the passage of the spiral arms. The map of the star formation rate predicted by our chemical evolution model with multiple patterns of spiral arms presents arcs and arms compatible with those revealed by multiple tracers (young upper main sequence stars, Cepheids, and distribution of stars with low radial actions). Finally, our model predictions are in good agreement with the azimuthal variations that emerged from the analysis of Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec [M/H] abundance ratios, if at most recent times the pattern speeds match the Galactic rotational curve at all radii.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the relationship between stellar surface density and gas surface density (the star-gas or S-G correlation) in a 20,000 M$_{\odot}$ simulation from the STAR FORmation in Gaseous Environments (STARFORGE) Project. We create synthetic observations based on the Spitzer and Herschel telescopes by modeling active galactic nuclei contamination, smoothing based on angular resolution, cropping the field-of-view, and removing close neighbors and low-mass sources. We extract star-gas properties such as the dense gas mass fraction, the Class II:I ratio, and the S-G correlation ($\Sigma_{\rm YSO}/\Sigma_{\rm gas}$) from the simulation and compare them to observations of giant molecular clouds, young clusters, and star-forming regions, as well as to analytical models. We find that the simulation reproduces trends in the counts of young stellar objects and the median slope of the S-G correlation. This implies that the S-G correlation is not simply the result of observational biases but is in fact a real effect. However, other statistics, such as the Class II:I ratio and dense gas mass fraction, do not always match observed equivalents in nearby clouds. This motivates further observations covering the full simulation age range and more realistic modeling of cloud formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the formation of substructures in protoplanetary disks is vital for gaining insights into dust growth and the process of planet formation. Studying these substructures in highly embedded Class 0 objects using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), however, poses significant challenges. Nonetheless, it is imperative to do so to unravel the mechanisms and timing behind the formation of these substructures. In this study, we present high-resolution ALMA data at Bands 6 and 4 of the NGC1333 IRAS4A Class 0 protobinary system. This system consists of two components, A1 and A2, separated by 1.8" and located in the Perseus molecular cloud at $\sim$293 pc distance. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the dust properties and formation of substructures in the early stages, we conducted a multi-wavelength analysis of IRAS4A1. Additionally, we sought to address whether the lack of observed substructures in very young disks, could be attributed to factors such as high degrees of disk flaring and large scale heights. To explore this phenomenon, we employed radiative transfer models using RADMC-3D. Our multi-wavelength analysis of A1 discovered characteristics such as high dust surface density, substantial dust mass within the disk, and elevated dust temperatures. These findings suggest the presence of large dust grains compared to the ones in the interstellar medium (ISM), greater than 100 microns in size within the region. Furthermore, while there's no direct detection of any substructure, our models indicate that some, such as a small gap, must be present. In summary, this result implies that disk substructures may be masked or obscured by a large scale height in combination with a high degree of flaring in Class 0 disks. [Abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 The exploration of the inner heliosphere by Parker Solar Probe has revealed a highly structured solar wind with ubiquitous deflections from the Parker spiral, known as switchbacks. Interchange reconnection (IR) may play an important role in generating these switchbacks by forming unstable particle distributions that generate wave activity that in turn may evolve to such structures. IR occurs in very low beta plasmas and in the presence of strong guiding fields. Although IR is unlikely to release enough energy to provide an important contribution to the heating and acceleration of the solar wind, it affects the way the solar wind is connected to its sources, connecting open field lines to regions of closed fields. This "switching on" provides a mechanism by which plasma near coronal hole boundaries can mix with that trapped inside the closed loops. This mixing can lead to a new energy balance. It may significantly change the characteristics of the solar wind because this plasma is already pre-heated and can potentially have quite different density and particle distributions. It not only replenishes the solar wind, but also affects the electric field, which in turn affects the energy balance. This interpenetration is manifested by the formation of a bimodal ion distribution, with a core and a beam-like population. Such distributions are indeed frequently observed by the Parker Solar Probe. Here we provide a first step towards assessing the role of such processes in accelerating and heating the solar wind.
