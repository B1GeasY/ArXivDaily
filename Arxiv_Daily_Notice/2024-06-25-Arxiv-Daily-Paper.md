 - **Abstract**
 WASP-69 b is a hot, inflated, Saturn-mass planet 0.26 Mjup with a zero-albedo equilibrium temperature of 963 K. Here, we report the JWST 2 to 12 um emission spectrum of the planet consisting of two eclipses observed with NIRCam grism time series and one eclipse observed with MIRI LRS. The emission spectrum shows absorption features of water vapor, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, but no strong evidence for methane. WASP-69 b's emission spectrum is poorly fit by cloud-free homogeneous models. We find three possible model scenarios for the planet: 1) a Scattering Model that raises the brightness at short wavelengths with a free Geometric Albedo parameter 2) a Cloud Layer model that includes high altitude silicate aerosols to moderate long wavelength emission and 3) a Two-Region model that includes significant dayside inhomogeneity and cloud opacity with two different temperature-pressure profiles. In all cases, aerosols are needed to fit the spectrum of the planet. The Scattering model requires an unexpectedly high Geometric Albedo of 0.64. Our atmospheric retrievals indicate inefficient redistribution of heat and an inhomogeneous dayside distribution, which is tentatively supported by MIRI LRS broadband eclipse maps that show a central concentration of brightness. Our more plausible models (2 and 3) retrieve chemical abundances enriched in heavy elements relative to solar composition by 6x to 14x solar and a C/O ratio of 0.65 to 0.94, whereas the less plausible highly reflective scenario (1) retrieves a slightly lower metallicity and lower C/O ratio.

 - **Abstract**
 A viable model for the dense matter equation of state above the nuclear saturation density is a hadron-to-quark phase transition at densities relevant to compact objects. In this case, stable hybrid hadron-quark stars can arise. An even more interesting scenario is one where the hadron-to-quark phase transition results in the emergence of a third branch of stable compact objects (in addition to white dwarfs and neutron stars). Inherent to the presence of a third family of compact stars is the existence of twin stars -- hybrid stars with the same mass as the corresponding neutron stars, but with smaller radii. Interestingly, the neutron star-twin star scenario is consistent with GW170817. If twin stars exist in nature, it raises a question about the mechanism that leads to their formation. Here, we explore gravitational collapse as a pathway to the formation of low-mass twin stars. We perform fully general relativistic simulations of the collapse of a stellar iron core, modeled as a cold degenerate gas, to investigate whether the end product is a neutron star or a twin star. Our simulations show that even with unrealistically large perturbations in the initial conditions, the core bounces well below the hadron-to-quark phase transition density, if the initial total rest mass is in the twin star range. Following cooling, these configurations produce neutron stars. We find that twin stars can potentially form due to mass loss, e.g., through winds, from a slightly more massive hybrid star that was initially produced in the collapse of a more massive core or if the maximum NS mass is below the Chandrasekhar mass limit. The challenge in producing twin stars in gravitational collapse, in conjunction with the fine tuning required because of their narrow mass range, suggest the rarity of twin stars in nature.
#### The Impact of Non-Gaussian Primordial Tails on Cosmological Observables

 - **Abstract**
 Whilst current observational evidence favors a close-to-Gaussian spectrum of primordial perturbations, there exist many models of the early Universe that predict this distribution to have exponentially enhanced or suppressed tails. In this work, we generate realizations of the primordial potential with non-Gaussian tails via a phenomenological model; these are then evolved numerically to obtain maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure (LSS). In the CMB maps, our added non-Gaussianity manifests as a localized enhancement of hot and cold spots, which would be expected to contribute to $N$-point functions up to large $N$. Such models are indirectly constrained by \textit{Planck} trispectrum bounds, which restrict the changes in the temperature fluctuations to $O(10\mu\mathrm{K})$. In the late-time Universe, we find that tailed cosmologies lead to a halo mass function enhanced at high masses, as expected. Furthermore, significant scale-dependent bias in the halo-halo and halo-matter power spectrum is also sourced, which arises from the squeezed limit of large $N$-point functions that are implicitly generated through the enhancement of the tails. These results underscore that a detection of scale-dependent bias alone cannot be used to rule out single field inflation, but can be used together with other statistics to probe a wide range of primordial processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Flares are a well-studied aspect of the Sun's magnetic activity. Detecting and classifying solar flares can inform the analysis of contamination caused by stellar flares in exoplanet transmission spectra. In this paper, we present a standardized procedure to classify solar flares with the aid of supervised machine learning. Using flare data from the RHESSI mission and solar spectra from the HARPS-N instrument, we trained several supervised machine learning models, and found that the best performing algorithm is a C-Support Vector Machine (SVC) with non-linear kernels, specifically Radial Basis Functions (RBF). The best-trained model, SVC with RBF kernels, achieves an average aggregate accuracy score of 0.65, and categorical accuracy scores of over 0.70 for the no-flare and weak-flare classes, respectively. In comparison, a blind classification algorithm would have an accuracy score of 0.33. Testing showed that the model is able to detect and classify solar flares in entirely new data with different characteristics and distributions from those of the training set. Future efforts could focus on enhancing classification accuracy, investigating the efficacy of alternative models, particularly deep learning models, and incorporating more datasets to extend the application of this framework to stars that host exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 The Simons Observatory (SO) is a cosmic microwave background (CMB) observatory consisting of three small aperture telescopes and one large aperture telescope. SO is located in the Atacama Desert in Chile at an elevation of 5180m. Distributed among the four telescopes are over 60,000 transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers across six spectral bands centered between 27 and 280 GHz. A large collection of ancillary hardware devices which produce lower rate `housekeeping' data are used to support the detector data collection. We developed a distributed control system, which we call the observatory control system (ocs), to coordinate data collection among all systems within the observatory. ocs is a core component of the deployed site software, interfacing with all on-site hardware. Alongside ocs we utilize a combination of internally and externally developed open source projects to enable remote monitoring, data management, observation coordination, and data processing. Deployment of a majority of the software is done using Docker containers. The deployment of software packages is partially done via automated Ansible scripts, utilizing a GitOps based approach for updating infrastructure on site. We describe an overview of the software and computing systems deployed within SO, including how those systems are deployed and interact with each other. We also discuss the timing distribution system and its configuration as well as lessons learned during the deployment process and where we plan to make future improvements.

 - **Abstract**
 Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offer significant insights into cosmology due to their high energy emissions and the potential to probe the early universe. The Amati relation, which links the intrinsic peak energy to the isotropic energy, is crucial for understanding their cosmological applications. This study investigates the redshift-driven heterogeneity of the Amati correlation in long GRBs. Analyzing 221 long GRBs with redshifts from 0.034 to 8.2 we divided the dataset based on redshift thresholds of 1.5 and 2. Using Bayesian marginalization and Reichart's likelihood approach, we found significant differences in the Amati parameters between low and high redshift subgroups. These variations, differing by approximately $2\sigma$ at $z = 1.5$ and more than $1\sigma$ at $z = 2$, suggest an evolution in the GRB population with redshift, possibly reflecting changes in host galaxy properties. However, selection effects and instrumental biases may also contribute. Our results challenge the assumption of the Amati relation's universality and underscore the need for larger datasets and more precise measurements from upcoming missions like THESEUS and eXTP to refine our understanding of GRB physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic double white dwarfs are predominant sources of gravitational waves in the millihertz frequencies accessible to space-borne gravitational wave detectors. With advances in multi-messenger astronomy, an increasing number of double white dwarf systems will be discovered through both electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. In this paper, we simulated two populations of double white dwarfs originating from different star formation histories (hereafter referred to as Model 1 and Model 2) using the binary population synthesis method. We predicted the number of double white dwarfs in our Galaxy detectable by TianQin and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) individually, as well as through their joint observation. In addition, we performed an analysis to evaluate the accuracy of the parameter estimation using the Fisher information matrix. Furthermore, we predicted the number of eclipsing double white dwarfs detectable by Gaia and LSST. Our study found that over the nominal mission durations, TianQin, LISA, and their joint observation can detect $5\times10^3$ ($1\times10^4$), $1.7\times10^4$ ($3.3\times10^4$), and $1.8\times10^4$ ($3.5\times10^4$) double white dwarfs with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 7 in Model 1 (Model 2), respectively. Gaia and LSST are expected to detect 67 (186) and 273 (554) eclipsing double white dwarfs in Model 1 (Model 2) with orbital period less than 30 hours, respectively. We also found that several dozen eclipsing double white dwarfs can be detected jointly through electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar winds form an integral part of astronomy. The solar wind affects Earth's magnetosphere, while the winds of hot massive stars are highly relevant for galactic feedback through their mechanical wind energy. In different parts of the stellar HR diagram different forces dominate. On the hot side of the HRD radiative forces on ionised gas particles are active, while on the cool side molecular and dust opacities take over. Moreover, due to the convective envelopes, alternative physical ingredients may start to dominate. I will describe the basic equation of motion and give a few examples, mostly focusing on the winds from massive stars. Here mass-loss rates significantly affect the stellar evolution all the way to core collapse as a supernova and/or black hole formation event.
#### Thermal Evolution of the IGM due to Lyman-{\alpha} photons during the Cosmic Dawn

 - **Abstract**
 The first star-forming objects which formed at high redshifts during the cosmic dawn (CD) also emitted photons between Lyman-$\alpha$ and Lyman-limit frequencies. These photons are instrumental in coupling the spin temperature of the neutral hydrogen (HI) atoms with the kinetic temperature of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Along with this coupling effect, these photons also impact the kinetic temperature by exchanging energy with the HI atoms. The injected Lyman-$\alpha$ photons in general cool the medium, while the continuum photons heat the medium. While studying this effect in the literature, quasi-static profile around the Lyman-$\alpha$ frequency is assumed. In this paper, we solve the time-dependent coupled dynamics of the photon intensity profile along with the evolution of the thermal state of the IGM and HI spin temperature. It is expected that, during the CD era, the IGM has a mix of continuum photons with 10-20% of injected photons. For this case, we show that the system reaches thermal equilibrium in around 1 Myr, with final temperature in the range 50-100 K. This time scale is comparable to the source lifetime of PopIII stars at high redshifts. One impact of switching off short-lived sources is that it can keep the system heated above the temperature of the quasi-static state. We also show that the quasi-static equilibrium for the continuum photons is only achieved on time scales of 100 Myr at $z\simeq 20$, comparable to the age of the Universe. We also briefly discuss how the Lyman-$\alpha$ induced heating can impact the 21 cm signal from CD.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of extended main-sequence turn-offs (eMSTO) in star clusters younger than 2 Gyr still challenges our current understanding of stellar evolution. Exploiting data from Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3), we investigate eMSTOs in a large sample of 32 Galactic open clusters younger than 2.4 Gyr. We first validate Gaia rotational velocities from Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) spectra by comparing them with literature values and assessing their correlation with magnetic activity measurements from LAMOST spectra. We detect a general positive correlation between turn-off color and projected stellar rotation, with slow-rotating stars predominantly found on the bluer side of the turn-off. Comparing our observations with theoretical models, we find that the eMSTO morphology is well-reproduced by a single population formed with a high rotation rate, and observed with rotation axis inclination ranging between 0$^\circ$ (pole-on) and 90$^\circ$ (edge-on). This contrasts with observations of Magellanic Clouds clusters, where a population of non-rotating stars appears to be ubiquitous in clusters younger than 700 Myr. However, we note that our interpretation, while successfully explaining the overall eMSTO morphology, cannot fully explain the observed projected rotational velocities. Additionally, two young clusters, NGC 3532 and NGC 2287, exhibit moderate evidence of a split main sequence in color and rotation, suggesting a possible small spread in the initial rotation rate. Finally, we advise caution in determining the ages of young clusters from non-rotating isochrones, as neglecting the effects of stellar rotation can impact the isochrone dating by up to factors of 5-20%.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a pioneering spatially-resolved, multi-phase gas abundance study on the blue compact dwarf galaxy NGC~5253, targeting 10 star-forming (SF) clusters inside six FUV HST/COS pointings with co-spatial optical VLT/MUSE observations throughout the galaxy. The SF regions span a wide range of ages (1--15 Myr) and are distributed at different radii (50 -- 230 pc). We performed robust absorption-line profile fitting on the COS spectra, covering 1065--1430 Å in the FUV, allowing an accurate computation of neutral-gas abundances for 13 different ions sampling 8 elements. These values were then compared with the ionized-gas abundances, measured using the direct method on MUSE integrated spectra inside analog COS apertures. Our multi-phase, spatially resolved comparisons find abundances which are lower in the neutral gas than the ionized gas by 0.22 dex, 0.80 dex and 0.58 dex for log(O/H), log(N/H) and log(N/O), respectively. We modeled the chemical abundance distributions and evaluated correlations as a function of radius and age. It was found that while N, O and N/O abundances decrease as a function of age in the ionized gas, they increase with age in the neutral gas. No strong correlations for N, O or N/O were observed as a function of radius. The N/O and N/H offsets between the phases were found to decrease with age, providing evidence that chemical enrichment happens differentially, first in the ionized-gas phase around 2--5 Myrs (due to N-rich Wolf-Rayet stars) and then mixing out into the cold neutral gas on longer timescales of 10--15 Myr.

 - **Abstract**
 The ESO public survey VISTA Variables in the Vía Láctea (VVV) surveyed the inner Galactic bulge and the adjacent southern Galactic disk from $2009-2015$. Upon its conclusion, the complementary VVV eXtended (VVVX) survey has expanded both the temporal as well as spatial coverage of the original VVV area, widening it from $562$ to $1700$ sq. deg., as well as providing additional epochs in $JHK_{\rm s}$ filters from $2016-2023$. With the completion of VVVX observations during the first semester of 2023, we present here the observing strategy, a description of data quality and access, and the legacy of VVVX. VVVX took $\sim 2000$ hours, covering about 4% of the sky in the bulge and southern disk. VVVX covered most of the gaps left between the VVV and the VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS) areas and extended the VVV time baseline in the obscured regions affected by high extinction and hence hidden from optical observations. VVVX provides a deep $JHK_{\rm s}$ catalogue of $\gtrsim 1.5\times10^9$ point sources, as well as a $K_{\rm s}$ band catalogue of $\sim 10^7$ variable sources. Within the existing VVV area, we produced a $5D$ map of the surveyed region by combining positions, distances, and proper motions of well-understood distance indicators such as red clump stars, RR Lyrae, and Cepheid variables. In March 2023 we successfully finished the VVVX survey observations that started in 2016, an accomplishment for ESO Paranal Observatory upon 4200 hours of observations for VVV+VVVX. The VVV+VVVX catalogues complement those from the Gaia mission at low Galactic latitudes and provide spectroscopic targets for the forthcoming ESO high-multiplex spectrographs MOONS and 4MOST.
#### North-PHASE: Studying Periodicity, Hot Spots, Accretion Stability and Early Evolution in young stars in the northern hemisphere

 - **Abstract**
 We present the overview and first results from the North-PHASE Legacy Survey, which follows six young clusters for five years, using the 2 deg$^2$ FoV of the JAST80 telescope from the Javalambre Observatory (Spain). North-PHASE investigates stellar variability on timescales from days to years for thousands of young stars distributed over entire clusters. This allows us to find new YSO, characterise accretion and study inner disk evolution within the cluster context. Each region (Tr37, CepOB3, IC5070, IC348, NGC2264, and NGC1333) is observed in six filters (SDSS griz, u band, and J0660, which covers H$\alpha$), detecting cluster members as well as field variable stars. Tr37 is used to prove feasibility and optimise the variability analysis techniques. In Tr37, variability reveals 50 new YSO, most of them proper motion outliers. North-PHASE independently confirms the youth of astrometric members, efficiently distinguishes accreting and non-accreting stars, reveals the extent of the cluster populations along Tr37/IC1396 bright rims, and detects variability resulting from rotation, dips, and irregular bursts. The proper motion outliers unveil a more complex star formation history than inferred from Gaia alone, and variability highlights previously hidden proper motion deviations in the surrounding clouds. We also find that non-YSO variables identified by North-PHASE cover a different variability parameter space and include long-period variables, eclipsing binaries, RR Lyr, and $\delta$ Scuti stars. These early results also emphasize the power of variability to complete the picture of star formation where it is missed by astrometry.
