 - **Abstract**
 We present a uniform forward-modeling analysis of 90 late-M and L dwarfs in nearby young (~$10-200$ Myr) moving groups, the Pleiades, and the Hyades using low-resolution ($R\approx150$) near-infrared ($0.9-2.4$ $\mathrm{\mu m}$) spectra and the BT-Settl model atmospheres. We derive the objects' effective temperatures, surface gravities, radii, and masses by comparing our spectra to the models using a Bayesian framework with nested sampling and calculate the same parameters using evolutionary models. Assuming the evolutionary-based parameters are more robust, our spectroscopically inferred parameters from BT-Settl exhibit two types of systematic behavior for objects near the M-L spectral type boundary. Several are clustered around $T_\mathrm{eff} \approx 1800$ K and $\log g\approx5.5$ dex, implying impossibly large masses ($150-1400$ $M_\mathrm{Jup}$), while others are clustered around $T_\mathrm{eff}\gtrsim3000$ K and $\log g\lesssim3.0$ dex, implying non-physical low masses and unreasonably young ages. We find the fitted BT-Settl model spectra tend to overpredict the peak $J$ and $H$-band flux for objects located near the M-L boundary, suggesting the dust content included in the model atmospheres is insufficient to match the observations. By adding an interstellar medium-like reddening law to the BT-Settl model spectra, we find the fits between models and observed spectra are greatly improved, with the largest reddening coefficients occurring at the M-L transition. This work delivers a systematic examination of the BT-Settl model atmospheres and constitutes the largest spectral analysis of benchmark late-M and L-type brown dwarfs to date.
#### A Pathway for Collisional Planetesimal Growth in the Ice-Dominant  Regions of Protoplanetary Disks

 - **Abstract**
 We present a semi-analytic model for the growth, drift, desorption, and fragmentation of millimeter- to meter-sized particles in protoplanetary disks. Fragmentation occurs where particle collision velocities exceed critical fragmentation velocities. Using this criterion, we produce fragmentation regions in disk orbital radius-particle size phase space for particles with a range of material properties, structures, and compositions (including SiO$_2$, Mg$_2$SiO$_4$, H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and CO). For reasonable disk conditions, compact aggregate H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and CO ice particles do not reach destructive relative velocities and are thus not likely to undergo collisional fragmentation. Uncoated silicate particles are more susceptible to collisional destruction and are expected to fragment in the inner disk, consistent with previous work. We then calculate the growth, drift, and sublimation of small particles, initially located in the outer disk. We find that ice-coated particles can avoid fragmentation as they grow and drift inward under a substantial range of disk conditions as long as the particles are aggregates composed of 0.1 $\mu$m-sized monomers. Such particles may undergo runaway growth in disk regions abundant in H$_2$O or CO$_2$ ice depending on the assumed disk temperature structure. These results indicate that icy collisional growth to planetesimally-relevant sizes may happen efficiently throughout a disk's lifetime, and is particularly robust at early times when the disk's dust-to-gas ratio is comparable to that of the interstellar medium.
#### Variety of disk wind-driven explosions in massive rotating stars

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a set of two-dimensional, non-relativistic, hydrodynamics simulations for supernova-like explosion associated with stellar core collapse of rotating massive stars to a system of a black hole and a disk connected by the transfer of matter and angular momentum. Our model of the central engine also includes the contribution of the disk wind. In this work, we specifically investigate the wind-driven explosion of rotating, large-mass progenitor stars with the zero-age main-sequence mass of $M_\mathrm{ZAMS}=20\,M_\odot$ from arXiv:2008.09132 . This study is carried out using the open-source hydrodynamic code Athena++, for which we implement a method to calculate self-gravity for axially symmetric density distributions. We, then, investigate the explosion properties and the $^{56}$Ni production as a function of (varying) some features of the wind injection. We find a large variety of explosion energy with $E_\mathrm{expl}$ ranging from $\sim 0.049\times10^{51}$~erg to $\sim 34\times10^{51}$~erg and ejecta mass $M_\mathrm{ej}$ from 0.58 to 6 $M_\odot$, which shows a bimodal distribution in high- and low-energy branches. We demonstrate that the resulting outcome of a highly- or sub-energetic explosion for a certain stellar structure is mainly determined by the competition between the ram pressure of the injected matter and that of the infalling envelope. In the nucleosynthesis analysis the $^{56}$Ni mass produced in our models goes from $< 0.2~M_\odot$ in the sub-energetic explosions to $2.1~M_\odot$ in the highly-energetic ones. These results are consistent with the observational data of stripped-envelope and high-energy SNe such as broad-lined type Ic SNe. However, we find a tighter correlation between the explosion energy and the ejecta mass than that observationally measured.
#### The formation of wide-orbit giant planets in protoplanetary disks with a  decreasing pebble flux

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of distant protoplanets could explain the observed gaps in dust emission in protoplanetary disks. Here we derive a novel analytical model to describe the temporal decay of the pebble flux through a protoplanetary disk as a result of radial drift. This allows us to investigate the growth and migration of distant protoplanets throughout the lifespan of the disk. We find that early-formed Moon-mass protoplanets can grow to their pebble isolation mass between approximately $20$ and $80\,M_{\oplus}$ within less than $1\,\mathrm{Myr}$ in the $20$ to $80\,\mathrm{AU}$ region around solar-like stars. Subsequent fast migration at the early stages of gas accretion after pebble accretion has been halted nevertheless transports these giant planets into final orbits at $<\,$$10\,\mathrm{AU}$. However, our pebble decay model allows us to include a new pathway which can trigger the transition from pebble accretion to gas accretion after the pebble flux has decayed substantially. With this pebble decay pathway, we show that it is possible to form gas giants also beyond $10\,\mathrm{AU}$. The occurrence of these wide-orbit gas giants should be relatively low, since their core must attain sufficient mass to accrete gas before the pebble flux decays while avoiding excessive migration. Since these gas giants do not reach the pebble isolation mass, their heavy element content is typically less than $10\,M_{\oplus}$. Our results imply that the observed gaps in protoplanetary disks could be caused by distant protoplanets that reached the pebble isolation mass and then migrated, while gas giants in wide orbits, such as PDS 70 b and c, accreted their gas after the decay in the pebble flux.
#### Determinação da Distância à Grande Nuvem de Magalhães  Através das Estrelas Variáveis Cefeidas Disponíveis no Catálogo  OGLE-IV

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we discuss the determination of the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using the Leavitt Law, utilizing the public catalog of Classical Cepheid Variable stars from the observational project OGLE-IV (The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment Collection of Variable Stars), consisting of 4709 stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. To determine the pulsation period of Cepheid Variable stars, we employ the computational algorithm \textit{Lomb-Scargle periodogram} modified for our data. Additionally, with the calculation of the period, we can derive a period-luminosity relation for Cepheid Variables in the Large Magellanic Cloud and, using an independent calibration distance, deduce their distance moduli. We also discuss some general theoretical concepts of the physical mechanism behind the oscillation of variable stars.
#### Glitching pulsars as gravitational wave sources

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.04586
 - **Abstract**
 Spinning neutron stars, when observed as pulsars, are seen to undergo occasional spin-up events known as glitches. Despite several decades of study, the physical mechanisms responsible for glitches are still not well understood, but probably involve an interplay between the star's outer elastic crust, and the superfluid and superconducting core that lies within. Glitches will be accompanied by some level of gravitational wave emission. In this article, we review and critique proposed models that link gravitational wave emission to glitches, exploring both short duration burst-like emission, and longer-lived signals. We illustrate how detections (and in some cases, non-detections) of gravitational signals probe both the glitch mechanism, and, by extension, the behaviour of matter at high densities.

 - **Abstract**
 The recently discovered super-Earth LP 890-9 c is an intriguing target for atmospheric studies as it transits a nearby, low-activity late-type M-dwarf star at the inner edge of the Habitable Zone. Its position at the runaway greenhouse limit makes it a natural laboratory to study the climate evolution of hot rocky planets. We present the first 3D-GCM exo-Venus model for a modern Venus-like atmosphere (92 bar surface pressure, realistic composition, H$_2$SO$_4$ radiatively-active clouds), applied to the tidally-locked LP 890-9c to inform observations by JWST and future instruments. If LP 890-9 c has developed into a modern exo-Venus, then the modelled temperatures suggest that H$_2$SO$_4$ clouds are possible even in the substellar region. Like on modern Venus, clouds on LP 890-9 c would create a flat spectrum. The strongest CO$_2$ bands in transmission predicted by our model for LP 890-9 c are about 10 ppm, challenging detection, given JWST estimated noise floor. Estimated phase curve amplitudes are 0.9 and 2.4 ppm for continuum and CO$_2$ bands, respectively. While pointing out the challenge to characterise modern exo-Venus analogues, these results provide new insights for JWST proposals and highlight the influence of clouds in the spectrum of hot rocky exoplanet spectra.
#### A self-synthesized origin of heavy metals in hot subdwarf stars?

 - **Abstract**
 Some He-rich hot subdwarf stars (He-sdOBs) present high abundances of trans-iron elements, such as Sr, Y, Zr and Pb. Diffusion processes are important in hot subdwarf stars, and it is thought that the high abundances of heavy elements in these stars are due to the action of radiative levitation. However, during the formation of He-sdOBs, hydrogen can be ingested into the convective zone driven by the He-core flash. It is known that episodes in which protons are being ingested into He-burning convective zones can lead to neutron-capture processes and the formation of heavy elements. In this work we aim to explore for the first time if neutron-capture processes can occur in late He-core flashes happening in the cores of the progenitors of He-sdOBs. We compute a detailed evolutionary model of a stripped red-giant star with a stellar evolution code with a nuclear network comprising 32 isotopes. Then we post-process the stellar models in the phase of He and H burning with a post-processing nucleosynthesis code with a nuclear network of 1190 species that allows us to follow the neutron-capture processes in detail. We find the occurrence of neutron-capture processes in our model, with neutron densities reaching a value of $\sim5\times10^{12}\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$. We find that the trans-iron elements are enhanced in the surface by 1 to 2 dex as compared to initial compositions. Moreover, the relative abundance pattern $[{\rm X}_i/\rm{Fe}]$ produced by neutron-capture processes closely resembles those observed in some He-sdOBs, hinting at a possible self-synthesized origin of the heavy elements in these stars. We conclude that intermediate neutron-capture processes can occur during a proton ingestion event in the He-core flash of stripped red-giant stars. This mechanism offers a natural channel to produce the heavy elements observed in some of the He-sdOBs.

 - **Abstract**
 The large-scale gaseous shocks in the bulge of M31 can be naturally explained by a rotating stellar bar. We use gas dynamical models to provide an independent measurement of the bar pattern speed in M31. The gravitational potentials of our simulations are from a set of made-to-measure models constrained by stellar photometry and kinematics. If the inclination of the gas disk is fixed at $i = 77^{\circ}$, we find that a low pattern speed of $16-20\;\rm km\;s^{-1}\;kpc^{-1}$ is needed to match the observed position and amplitude of the shock features, as shock positions are too close to the bar major axis in high $\Omega_{b}$ models. The pattern speed can increase to $20-30\;\rm km\;s^{-1}\;kpc^{-1}$ if the inner gas disk has a slightly smaller inclination angle compared with the outer one. Including sub-grid physics such as star formation and stellar feedback has minor effects on the shock amplitude, and does not change the shock position significantly. If the inner gas disk is allowed to follow a varying inclination similar to the HI and ionized gas observations, the gas models with a pattern speed of $38\;\rm km\;s^{-1}\;kpc^{-1}$, which is consistent with stellar-dynamical models, can match both the shock features and the central gas features.

 - **Abstract**
 In the era of multi-messenger astronomy, early classification of photometric alerts from wide-field and high-cadence surveys is a necessity to trigger spectroscopic follow-ups. These classifications are expected to play a key role in identifying potential candidates that might have a corresponding gravitational wave (GW) signature. Machine learning classifiers using features from parametric fitting of light curves are widely deployed by broker software to analyze millions of alerts, but most of these algorithms require as many points in the filter as the number of parameters to produce the fit, which increases the chances of missing a short transient. Moreover, the classifiers are not able to account for the uncertainty in the fits when producing the final score. In this context, we present a novel classification strategy that incorporates data-driven priors for extracting a joint posterior distribution of fit parameters and hence obtaining a distribution of classification scores. We train and test a classifier to identify kilonovae events which originate from binary neutron star mergers or neutron star black hole mergers, among simulations for the Zwicky Transient Facility observations with 19 other non-kilonovae-type events. We demonstrate that our method can estimate the uncertainty of misclassification, and the mean of the distribution of classification scores as point estimate obtains an AUC score of 0.96 on simulated data. We further show that using this method we can process the entire alert steam in real-time and bring down the sample of probable events to a scale where they can be analyzed by domain experts.
