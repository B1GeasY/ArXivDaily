 - **Abstract**
 This paper describes the overview of the FLASHING (Finest Legacy Acquisitions of SiO-/ H$_2$O-maser Ignitions by the Nobeyama Generation) project promoted using the 45 m telescope of Nobeyama Radio Observatory, which aims to intensively monitor H$_2$O (22 GHz) and SiO (43 GHz) masers associated with so-called "water fountain" sources. Here we show scientific results on the basis of the data taken in for the first five seasons of FLASHING, from 2018 December to 2023 April). We have found the evolution of the H$_2$O maser spectra, such as new spectral components breaking the record of the jet's top speed and/or systematic velocity drifts in the spectrum indicating acceleration or deceleration of the maser gas clumps. For the 43 GHz SiO maser emission, we have found its new detection in a source while its permanent disappearance in other source. Our finding may imply that the jets from these water fountains can be accelerated or decelerated, and show how cicumstellar envelopes have been destroyed.

 - **Abstract**
 We have selected 337 intermediate and high-mass YSOs ($1.5$ to $20$ M$_{\odot}$) well-characterised with spectroscopy. By means of the clustering algorithm HDBSCAN, we study their clustering and association properties in the Gaia DR3 catalogue as a function of stellar mass. We find that the lower mass YSOs ($1.5-4$ M$_{\odot}$) have clustering rates of $55-60\%$ in Gaia astrometric space, a percentage similar to the one found in the T Tauri regime. However, intermediate-mass YSOs in the range $4-10$ M$_{\odot}$ show a decreasing clustering rate with stellar mass, down to $27\%$. We find tentative evidence suggesting that massive YSOs ($>10$ M$_{\odot}$) often appear $-$yet not always$-$ clustered. We put forward the idea that most massive YSOs form via a mechanism that demands many low-mass stars around them. However, intermediate-mass YSOs form in a classical core-collapse T Tauri way, yet they do not appear often in the clusters around massive YSOs. We also find that intermediate and high-mass YSOs become less clustered with decreasing disk emission and accretion rate. This points towards an evolution with time. For those sources that appear clustered, no major correlation is found between their stellar properties and the cluster sizes, number of cluster members, cluster densities, or distance to cluster centres. In doing this analysis, we report the identification of 55 new clusters. We present tabulated all the derived cluster parameters for the considered intermediate and high-mass YSOs.

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss problems of planetesimal migration in the emerging Solar System and exoplanetary systems. Protoplanetary disk evolution models and the formation of planets are considered. The formation of the Moon and of the asteroid and trans-Neptunian belts is studied. We show that Earth and Venus could acquire more than half of their mass in 5 million years, and their outer layers could accumulate the same material from different parts of the feeding zone of these planets. The migration of small bodies toward the terrestrial planets from various regions of the Solar System is simulated numerically. Based on these computations, we conclude that the mass of water delivered to the Earth by planetesimals, comets, and carbonaceous chondrite asteroids from beyond the ice line could be comparable to the mass of Earth's oceans. The processes of dust migration in the Solar System and sources of the zodiacal cloud are considered.

 Looking to the future of exo-Earth imaging from the ground, core technology developments are required in visible extreme adaptive optics (ExAO) to enable the observation of atmospheric features such as oxygen on rocky planets in visible light. UNDERGROUND (Ultra-fast AO techNology Determination for Exoplanet imageRs from the GROUND), a collaboration built in Feb. 2023 at the Optimal Exoplanet Imagers Lorentz Workshop, aims to (1) motivate oxygen detection in Proxima Centauri b and analogs as an informative science case for high-contrast imaging and direct spectroscopy, (2) overview the state of the field with respect to visible exoplanet imagers, and (3) set the instrumental requirements to achieve this goal and identify what key technologies require further development.

 - **Abstract**
 We present updated atmospheric tables suitable for calculating the post-formation evolution and cooling of Jupiter and Jupiter-like exoplanets. These tables are generated using a 1D radiative transfer modeling code that incorporates the latest opacities and realistic prescriptions for stellar irradiation and ammonia clouds. To ensure the accuracy of our model parameters, we calibrate them against the measured temperature structure and geometric albedo spectrum of Jupiter, its effective temperature, and its inferred internal temperature. As a test case, we calculate the cooling history of Jupiter using an adiabatic and homogeneous interior and compare with extant models now used to evolve Jupiter and the giant planets. We find that our model reasonably matches Jupiter after evolving a hot-start initial condition to the present age of the solar system, with a discrepancy in brightness temperature/radius within two per cent. Our algorithm allows us to customize for different cloud, irradiation, and metallicity parameters. This class of boundary conditions can be used to study the evolution of solar-system giant planets and exoplanets with more complicated interior structures and non-adiabatic, inhomogeneous internal profiles.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (MMA) has produced a wealth of data with much more to come in the future. This enormous data set will reveal new insights into the physics of Core Collapse SuperNovae (CCSN), Binary Neutron Star Mergers (BNSM), and many other objects where it is actually possible, if not probable, that new physics is in operation. To tease out different possibilities, we will need to analyze signals from photons, neutrinos, gravitational waves, and chemical elements. This task is made all the more difficult when it is necessary to evolve the neutrino component of the radiation field and associated quantum-mechanical property of flavor in order to model the astrophysical system of interest -- a numerical challenge that has not been addressed to this day. In this work, we take a step in this direction by adopting the technique of angular-integrated moments with a truncated tower of dynamical equations and a closure, convolving a flavor-transformation with spatial transport to evolve the neutrino radiation quantum field. We show that moments capture the dynamical features of Fast Flavor Instabilities (FFI) and provide comparable results to a more precise particle-in-cell method. We propose areas for improvement in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 For the past several decades, numerous attempts have been made to model the climate of Mars with extensive studies focusing on the planet's dynamics and the understanding of its climate. While physical modeling and data assimilation approaches have made significant progress, uncertainties persist in comprehensively capturing and modeling the complexities of Martian climate. In this work, we propose a novel approach to Martian climate modeling by leveraging machine learning techniques that have shown remarkable success in Earth climate modeling. Our study presents a deep neural network designed to accurately model relative humidity in Gale Crater, as measured by NASA's Mars Science Laboratory ``Curiosity'' rover. By utilizing simulated meteorological variables produced by the Mars Planetary Climate Model, a robust Global Circulation Model, our model accurately predicts relative humidity with a mean error of 3\% and an $R^2$ score of 0.92. Furthermore, we present an approach to predict quantile ranges of relative humidity, catering to applications that require a range of values. To address the challenge of interpretability associated with machine learning models, we utilize an interpretable model architecture and conduct an in-depth analysis of its internal mechanisms and decision making processes. We find that our neural network can effectively model relative humidity at Gale crater using a few meteorological variables, with the monthly mean surface H$_2$O layer, planetary boundary layer height, convective wind speed, and solar zenith angle being the primary contributors to the model predictions. In addition to providing a fast and efficient method to modeling climate variables on Mars, this modeling approach can also be used to expand on current datasets by filling spatial and temporal gaps in observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The well-known anti-correlation between the optical/ultraviolet (UV) emission line equivalent widths of active galactic nuclei and the continuum luminosity (the so-called Baldwin effect) is a long-standing puzzle. One common hypothesis is that more luminous sources have softer spectral energy distribution (SED) in the extreme UV (EUV), as revealed by some observational studies. In this work we revisit this issue through cross-matching SDSS quasars with GALEX far-UV/near-UV catalogs and correcting the effect of a severe observational bias of significant UV detection incompleteness, i.e., the more luminous in observed-frame optical, the more likely detected in observed-frame UV. We find that, for GALEX detected quasars at 1.8 < z < 2.2, the rest-frame mean UV SED (~ 500 -- 3000 Angstrom) bewilderingly shows no luminosity dependence at log(\nu L_\nu(2200 Angstrom)) > 45 (up to 47.3), contrary to the standard thin disc model predictions and the observed Baldwin effect in this luminosity range. Probably, the universal mean UV SED is the result of a local atomic-originated process, and in fainter quasars stronger disk turbulence launching more clouds is the main origin of the Baldwin effect. After correcting for the absorption of the intergalactic medium, a rest-frame intrinsic mean EUV SED is derived from a sub-sample of bright quasars and is found to be much redder in the EUV than all previous quasar composite spectra, highlighting the significance of properly accounting for the sample incompleteness. Interestingly, the global consistence between our extremely red mean EUV SED and the line-driven wind model again supports an origin of a local physical process.

 - **Abstract**
 Ammonia is one of the most widely observed molecules in space, and many observations are able to resolve the hyperfine structure due to the electric quadrupole moment of the nitrogen nucleus. The observed spectra often display anomalies in the satellite components of the lines, which indicate substantial deviations from the local thermodynamic equilibrium. The interpretation of the spectra thus requires the knowledge of the rate coefficients for the hyperfine excitation of NH$_3$ induced by collisions with H$_2$ molecules, the dominant collider in the cold interstellar medium. In this paper we present the first such calculations using a recoupling approach. The rate coefficients are obtained for all hyperfine levels within rotation-inversion levels up to $j=4$ and temperatures up to 100 K by means of quantum scattering close-coupling calculations on an accurate, five-dimensional, potential energy surface. We show that the rate coefficients depart significantly from those obtained with the statistical approach and that they do not conform to any simple propensity rules. Finally, we perform radiative transfer calculations to illustrate the impact of our new rate coefficients by modelling the hyperfine line intensities of the inversion transition in ground state para-NH$_3$ ($j_k=1_1$) and of the rotational transition $1_0\rightarrow 0_0$ in ortho-NH$_3$.
#### On the evolution of a stellar system in the context of the virial  equation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.01544
 - **Abstract**
 The virial equation is used to clarify the nature of the dynamic evolution of a stellar system. Compared to the kinetic equation, it gives a deeper but incomplete description of the process of relaxation to a quasi-stationary state, which here means the fulfillment of the virial theorem. Analysis shows that the time to reach the virial equlibrium state $T_v$ is about two to three dozen dynamic time periods $T_d$. Namely, during $T_v$ the virial ratio, the mean harmonic radius, and the root-mean-square radius of the system fluctuate, and then the first two characteristics stabilize near their equilibrium values, while the root-mean-square radius continues to grow (possibly ad infinitum). This indicates a fundamentally different behavior of the moment of inertia of the system relative to the center of gravity and its potential energy, leading to the formation of a relatively small equilibrium core and an extended halo.
#### A fresh perspective on the 3-D dynamics of Tycho's supernova remnant:  ejecta asymmetries in X-rays

 - **Abstract**
 450 years after the explosion of the Type Ia SN1572, the dynamics of the Tycho supernova remnant can give us keys to understand the explosion mechanism and the interaction of the remnant with the interstellar medium. To probe the asymmetries and the evolution of the SNR, we track the ejecta dynamics using new methods applied to the deep X-ray observations available in the Chandra space telescope archive. For the line of sight velocity measurement Vz, we use the Doppler effect focused on the bright Si line in the 1.6-2.1 keV band. Using the component separation tool General Morphological Component Analysis (GMCA), we successfully disentangle the red and blueshifted Si ejecta emission. This allows us to reconstruct a map of the peak energy of the Si line with a total coverage of the SNR at a 2'' resolution and a proxy of the velocity in the line of sight. For the proper motions in the plane of the sky Vxy, we develop a new method, named Poisson Optical Flow, to measure the displacement of 2D features between the observations of 2003 and 2009. The result is a field of 1700 velocity vectors covering the entire SNR. These exhaustive 3D velocity measurements reveal the complex and patchy dynamics of the SNR. At the large-scale, an asymmetry with the North being dominantly blueshifted and the South redshifted is observed. The proper motion vector field Vxy highlights different dynamics between the East and the West parts of the SNR. The eastern velocity field is more disturbed by external inhomogeneities and the South-East ejecta knot. In particular, a slow-down is observed in the North-East which could be due to the interaction with higher densities as seen in other wavelengths. The vector field is also used to backtrace the center of the explosion which is then compared with potential stellar progenitors distances from the latest Gaia DR3, leaving only stars B and E as possible candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 Water is a very abundant molecule in star-forming regions. Its deuterium fractionation is an important tool for understanding its formation and evolution during the star and planet formation processes. While the HDO/H$_2$O ratio has been determined toward several Class 0 protostars and comets, the number of studies toward Class I protostars is limited. We aim to study the water deuteration toward the Class I binary protostar L1551 IRS5 and to investigate the effect of evolutionary stage and environment on variations in the water D/H ratio. Observations were made using the NOEMA interferometer. The HDO 3$_{1,2}$-2$_{2,1}$ transition at 225.9 GHz and the H$_2^{18}$O 3$_{1,3}$-2$_{2,0}$ transition at 203.4 GHz were covered with a spatial resolution of 0.5'' $\times$ 0.8'', while the HDO 4$_{2,2}$-4$_{2,3}$ transition at 143.7 GHz was observed with a resolution of 2.0'' $\times$ 2.5''. We used both LTE and non-LTE models. The three transitions are detected. The line profiles display two peaks, one at $\sim$6 km s$^{-1}$ and one at $\sim$9 km s$^{-1}$. We derive an HDO/H$_2$O ratio of (2.1 $\pm$ 0.8) $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ for the redshifted component and a lower limit of $>$ 0.3 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ for the blueshifted component due to the blending with the redshifted CH$_3$OCH$_3$ emission. The HDO/H$_2$O in L1551 IRS5 is similar to the ratios in isolated Class 0 sources and to the Class I V883 Ori, while it is significantly higher than in the clustered Class 0 sources and the comets. This suggests that the chemistry of protostars in low source densities clouds share more similarities with the isolated sources than the protostars of very dense clusters. If Class 0 protostars with few sources around and isolated Class 0 objects are comparable in the HDO/H$_2$O ratio, it would mean that there is little water reprocessing from the Class 0 to Class I protostellar stage.
#### Evolution of Chemistry in the envelope of Hot Corinos (ECHOS). I.  Extremely young sulphur chemistry in the isolated Class 0 object B335

 - **Abstract**
 Within the project Evolution of Chemistry in the envelope of HOt corinoS (ECHOS), we present a study of sulphur chemistry in the envelope of the Class 0 source B335 through observations in the spectral range 7, 3, and 2 mm. We have modelled observations assuming LTE and LVG approximation. We have also used the code Nautilus to study the time evolution of sulphur species. We have detected 20 sulphur species with a total gas-phase S abundance similar to that found in the envelopes of other Class 0 objects, but with significant differences in the abundances between sulphur carbon chains and sulphur molecules containing oxygen and nitrogen. Our results highlight the nature of B335 as a source especially rich in sulphur carbon chains unlike other Class 0 sources. The low presence or absence of some molecules, such as SO and SO+, suggests a chemistry not particularly influenced by shocks. We, however, detect a large presence of HCS+ that, together with the low rotational temperatures obtained for all the S species (<15 K), reveals the moderate or low density of the envelope of B335. We also find that observations are better reproduced by models with a sulphur depletion factor of 10 with respect to the sulphur cosmic elemental abundance. The comparison between our model and observational results for B335 reveals an age of 10$^4$$<$t$<$10$^5$ yr, which highlights the particularly early evolutionary stage of this source. B335 presents a different chemistry compared to other young protostars that have formed in dense molecular clouds, which could be the result of accretion of surrounding material from the diffuse cloud onto the protostellar envelope of B335. In addition, the analysis of the SO2/C2S, SO/CS, and HCS+/CS ratios within a sample of prestellar cores and Class 0 objects show that they could be used as good chemical evolutionary indicators of the prestellar to protostellar transition.

 - **Abstract**
 Airborne dust plays an active role in determining the thermal structure and chemical composition of the present-day atmosphere of Mars and possibly the planet's climate evolution over time through radiative--convective and cloud microphysics processes. Thus, accurate measurements of the distribution and variability of dust are required. Observations from the Mars Global Surveyor/Thermal Emission Spectrometer Mars Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter/Mars Climate Sounder and Mars Express/Fourier Transform Spectrometer and the Curiosity Rover have limited capability to measure dust. We show that spacecraft occultation of the Martian atmosphere at far-infrared frequencies between 1 and 10 THz can provide the needed global and temporal data on atmospheric dust by providing co-located measurements of temperature and dust opacity from the top of the atmosphere all the way down to the surface. In addition, spacecraft occultation by a small-satellite constellation could provide global measurements of the development of dust storms.

 - **Abstract**
 The interpretation of observations of atomic and molecular tracers in the galactic and extragalactic interstellar medium (ISM) requires comparisons with state-of-the-art astrophysical models to infer some physical conditions. Usually, ISM models are too time-consuming for such inference procedures, as they call for numerous model evaluations. As a result, they are often replaced by an interpolation of a grid of precomputed models. We propose a new general method to derive faster, lighter, and more accurate approximations of the model from a grid of precomputed models. These emulators are defined with artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed and trained to address the specificities inherent in ISM models. Indeed, such models often predict many observables (e.g., line intensities) from just a few input physical parameters and can yield outliers due to numerical instabilities or physical bistabilities. We propose applying five strategies to address these characteristics: 1) an outlier removal procedure; 2) a clustering method that yields homogeneous subsets of lines that are simpler to predict with different ANNs; 3) a dimension reduction technique that enables to adequately size the network architecture; 4) the physical inputs are augmented with a polynomial transform to ease the learning of nonlinearities; and 5) a dense architecture to ease the learning of simple relations. We compare the proposed ANNs with standard classes of interpolation methods to emulate the Meudon PDR code, a representative ISM numerical model. Combinations of the proposed strategies outperform all interpolation methods by a factor of 2 on the average error, reaching 4.5% on the Meudon PDR code. These networks are also 1000 times faster than accurate interpolation methods and require ten to forty times less memory. This work will enable efficient inferences on wide-field multiline observations of the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 We use zoom-in, hydrodynamical, cosmological $N$-body simulations tracing the formation of the first stellar clumps from the SImulating the Environments where Globular clusters Emerged (SIEGE) project, to study key structural properties of dark matter haloes when the Universe was only $0.92$ Gyr old. The very high-resolution (maximum physical resolution 0.3 h$^{-1}$ pc at $z=6.14$, smallest dark-matter particle mass $164\,M_{\odot}$) allows us to reach the very low mass end of the stellar-to-halo mass relation ($M_{\rm vir}=10^{7.5-9.5}\,M_{\odot}$) to study the processes that mould dark matter haloes during the first stages of structure formation. We investigate the role of baryonic cooling and stellar feedback, modeled from individual stars, in shaping haloes, and of environmental effects as accretion of dark matter along cosmic filaments and mergers. We find that the onset of star formation (typically for $\log M_{\rm vir}/M_{\odot}\simeq7.6$) causes the inner cusp in the haloes density profile to flatten into a core with constant density and size proportionally to the halo virial mass. Even at these mass scales, we confirm that baryons make haloes that have formed stars rounder in the central regions than haloes that have not formed stars yet, with median minor-to-major $\langle q \rangle$ and intermediate-to-major $\langle s \rangle$ axes 0.66 and 0.84, respectively. Our morphological analysis shows that, at $z=6.14$, haloes are largely prolate in the outer parts, with the major axis aligned along filaments of the cosmic web or towards smaller sub-haloes, with the degree of elongation having no significant dependence on the halo mass.

 We present a study of the physical and chemical properties of the Extended Green Object (EGO) G19.01$-$0.03 using sub-arcsecond angular resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.05mm and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) 1.21cm data. G19.01$-$0.03 MM1, the millimetre source associated with the central massive young stellar object (MYSO), appeared isolated and potentially chemically young in previous Submillimeter Array observations. In our $\sim0.4''$-resolution ALMA data, MM1 has four low-mass millimetre companions within 0.12pc, all lacking maser or outflow emission, indicating they may be prestellar cores. With a rich ALMA spectrum full of complex organic molecules, MM1 does not appear chemically young, but has molecular abundances typical of high-mass hot cores in the literature. At the 1.05mm continuum peak of MM1, $\mathrm{N}(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\mathrm{OH})=(2.22\pm0.01)\times10^{18}$cm$^{-2}$ and $T_{\mathrm{ex}} = 162.7\substack{+0.3 \\ -0.5}$K based on pixel-by-pixel Bayesian analysis of LTE synthetic methanol spectra across MM1. Intriguingly, the peak CH$_{3}$OH $T_{\mathrm{ex}}=165.5\pm0.6$ K is offset from MM1's millimetre continuum peak by $0.22''\sim880$au, and a region of elevated CH$_{3}$OH $T_{\mathrm{ex}}$ coincides with free-free VLA 5.01cm continuum, adding to the tentative evidence for a possible unresolved high-mass binary in MM1. In our VLA 1.21cm data, we report the first NH$_{3}$(3,3) maser detections towards G19.01$-$0.03, along with candidate 25GHz CH$_{3}$OH $5(2,3)-5(1,4)$ maser emission; both are spatially and kinematically coincident with 44GHz Class I CH$_{3}$OH masers in the MM1 outflow. We also report the ALMA detection of candidate 278.3GHz Class I CH$_{3}$OH maser emission towards this outflow, strengthening the connection of these three maser types to MYSO outflows.

 We present the first optical study of the supernova remnant (SNR) G7.7-3.7, with the aim of determining its evolutionary phase since it has been suggested to be the remnant of SN 386 AD. We obtained narrow-band images in the filters H$\alpha$ + [NII], H$\beta$, [OIII], [SII] that revealed faint optical emission in the southern region of the SNR consisting of two filaments elongated in the east-west direction aligned with the X-ray emitting region of the remnant. The filaments were seen in H$\alpha$ + [NII], [OIII] images and marginally in the [SII] images, with a non-detection in H$\beta$. Long-slit spectroscopy of three regions along one filament revealed large ratios of [SII] / H$\alpha$ = (1.6-2.5), consistent with that expected for a shock-heated SNR. The [SII] doublet ratio observed in two of the regions implies an upper limit for the electron density of the gas, with estimates falling below 400 cm$^{-3}$ and 600 cm$^{-3}$ in the respective areas. We discuss potential physical mechanisms that formed the observed optical filaments and we suggest that most likely they resulted by a collision of the SNR with a dense circumstellar shell lying at the southern region of the remnant.

 - **Abstract**
 Type II supernovae represent the most common stellar explosions in the Universe, for which the final stage evolution of their hydrogen-rich massive progenitors towards core-collapse explosion are elusive. The recent explosion of SN 2023ixf in a very nearby galaxy, Messier 101, provides a rare opportunity to explore this longstanding issue. With the timely high-cadence flash spectra taken within 1-5 days after the explosion, we can put stringent constraints on the properties of the surrounding circumstellar material around this supernova. Based on the rapid fading of the narrow emission lines and luminosity/profile of $\rm H\alpha$ emission at very early times, we estimate that the progenitor of SN 2023ixf lost material at a mass-loss rate $\dot{\rm M} \approx 6 \times 10^{-4}\, \rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ over the last 2-3 years before explosion. This close-by material, moving at a velocity $v_{\rm w} \approx 55\rm \, km\,s^{-1}$, accumulates a compact CSM shell at the radius smaller than $7 \times 10^{14}$ cm from the progenitor. Given the high mass-loss rate and relatively large wind velocity presented here, together with the pre-explosion observations made about two decades ago, the progenitor of SN 2023ixf could be a short-lived yellow hypergiant that evolved from a red supergiant shortly before the explosion.

 - **Abstract**
 The existing matched filtering method for gravitational wave (GW) search relies on a template bank. The computational efficiency of this method scales with the size of the templates within the bank. Higher-order modes and eccentricity will play an important role when third-generation detectors operate in the future. In this case, traditional GW search methods will hit computational limits. To speed up the computational efficiency of GW search, we propose the utilization of a deep learning (DL) model bank as a substitute for the template bank. This model bank predicts the latent templates embedded in the strain data. Combining an envelope extraction network and an astrophysical origin discrimination network, we realize a novel GW search framework. The framework can predict the GW signal's matched filtering signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Unlike the end-to-end DL-based GW search method, our statistical SNR holds greater physical interpretability than the $p_{score}$ metric. Moreover, the intermediate results generated by our approach, including the predicted template, offer valuable assistance in subsequent GW data processing tasks such as parameter estimation and source localization. Compared to the traditional matched filtering method, the proposed method can realize real-time analysis. The minor improvements in the future, the proposed method may expand to other scopes of GW search, such as GW emitted by the supernova explosion.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new gas-grain chemical model for the combined isotopic fractionation of carbon and nitrogen in molecular clouds, in which the isotope chemistry of carbon and nitrogen is coupled with a time-dependent description of spin-state chemistry. We updated the rate coefficients of some isotopic exchange reactions considered in the literature, and present here a set of new exchange reactions involving molecules substituted in $\rm ^{13}C$ and $\rm ^{15}N$ simultaneously. We apply the model to a series of zero-dimensional simulations representing a set of physical conditions across a prototypical prestellar core, exploring the deviations of the isotopic abundance ratios in the various molecules from the elemental isotopic ratios as a function of physical conditions and time. We find that the $\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$ ratio can deviate from the elemental ratio by up to a factor of several depending on the molecule, and that there are highly time-dependent variations in the ratios. The $\rm HCN/H^{13}CN$ ratio, for example, can obtain values of less than 10 depending on the simulation time. The $\rm ^{14}N/^{15}N$ ratios tend to remain close to the assumed elemental ratio within $\sim$ ten per cent, with no clear trends as a function of the physical conditions. Abundance ratios between $\rm ^{13}C$-containing molecules and $\rm ^{13}C$+$\rm ^{15}N$-containing molecules show somewhat increased levels of fractionation due to the newly included exchange reactions, though still remaining within a few tens of per cent of the elemental $\rm ^{14}N/^{15}N$ ratio. Our results imply the existence of gradients in isotopic abundance ratios across prestellar cores, suggesting that detailed simulations are required to interpret observations of isotopically substituted molecules correctly, especially given that the various isotopic forms of a given molecule do not necessarily trace the same gas layers.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a new general-relativistic viscous-radiation hydrodynamics simulation for supernova-like explosion associated with stellar core collapse of rotating massive stars to a system of a black hole and a massive torus paying particular attention to large-mass progenitor stars with the zero-age main-sequence mass of $M_\mathrm{ZAMS}=$20, 35, and 45$M_\odot$ of Ref.~\cite{Aguilera-Dena2020oct}. Assuming that a black hole is formed in a short timescale after the onset of the stellar collapse, the new simulations are started from initial data of a spinning black hole and infalling matter that self-consistently satisfy the constraint equations of general relativity. It is found that with a reasonable size of the viscous parameter, the supernova-like explosion is driven by the viscous heating effect in the torus around the black hole irrespective of the progenitor mass. The typical explosion energy and ejecta mass for the large-mass cases ($M_\mathrm{ZAMS}=35$ and $45M_\odot$) are $\sim 10^{52}$ erg and $\sim 5M_\odot$, respectively, with $^{56}$Ni mass larger than $0.15M_\odot$. These are consistent with the observational data of stripped-envelope and high-energy supernovae such as broad-lined type Ic supernovae. This indicates that rotating stellar collapses of massive stars to a black hole surrounded by a massive torus can be a central engine for high-energy supernovae. By artificially varying the angular velocity of the initial data, we explore the dependence of the explosion energy and ejecta mass on the initial angular momentum and find that the large explosion energy $\sim 10^{52}$ erg and large $^{56}$Ni mass $\geq 0.15M_\odot$ are possible only when a large-mass compact torus with mass $\gtrsim 1M_\odot$ is formed.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the expected population of core collapse supernova remnants and the huge number of detected pulsars in the Galaxy, still representing only a fraction of the real population, pulsar wind nebulae are likely to constitute one of the largest classes of {extended} Galactic sources in many energy bands. For simple evolutionary reasons, the majority of the population is made of evolved systems, whose detection and identification are complicated by their reduced luminosity, the possible lack of X-ray emission (that fades progressively away with the age of the pulsar), and by their modified morphology with respect to young systems. Nevertheless they have gained renewed attention in recent years, following the detection of misaligned X-ray tails protruding from an increasing number of nebulae created by fast moving pulsars, and of extended TeV halos surrounding aged systems. Both these features are clear signs of an efficient escape of particles, with energy close to the maximum acceleration limit of the pulsar. Here we discuss the properties of those evolved systems and what we have understood about the process of particle escape, and the formation of observed features.

 - **Abstract**
 Cool astrophysical objects, such as (exo)planets, brown dwarfs, or asymptotic giant branch stars, can be strongly affected by condensation. Condensation does not only directly affect the chemical composition of the gas phase by removing elements but the condensed material also influences other chemical and physical processes in these object. This includes, for example, the formation of clouds in planetary atmospheres and brown dwarfs or the dust-driven winds of evolved stars. In this study we introduce FastChem Cond, a new version of the FastChem equilibrium chemistry code that adds a treatment of equilibrium condensation. Determining the equilibrium composition under the impact of condensation is complicated by the fact that the number of condensates that can exist in equilibrium with the gas phase is limited by a phase rule. However, this phase rule does not directly provide information on which condensates are stable. As a major advantage of FastChem Cond is able to automatically select the set stable condensates satisfying the phase rule. Besides the normal equilibrium condensation, FastChem Cond can also be used with the rainout approximation that is commonly employed in atmospheres of brown dwarfs or (exo)planets. FastChem Cond is available as open-source code, released under the GPLv3 licence. In addition to the C++ code, FastChem Cond also offers a Python interface. Together with the code update we also add about 290 liquid and solid condensate species to FastChem.

 - **Abstract**
 Measurements of neutron star masses, radii, and tidal deformability have direct connections to nuclear physics via the equation of state (EoS), which for the cold, catalyzed matter in neutron star cores is commonly represented as the pressure as a function of energy density. Microscopic models with exotic degrees of freedom display nontrivial structure in the speed of sound ($c_s$) in the form of first-order phase transitions and bumps, oscillations, and plateaus in the case of crossovers and higher-order phase transitions. We present a procedure based on Gaussian processes to generate an ensemble of EoSs that include nontrivial features. Using a Bayesian analysis incorporating measurements from X-ray sources, gravitational wave observations, and perturbative QCD results, we show that these features are compatible with current constraints. We investigate the possibility of a global maximum in $c_s$ that occurs within the densities realized in neutron stars -- implying a softening of the EoS and possibly an exotic phase in the core of massive stars -- and find that such a global maximum is consistent with, but not required by, current constraints.

 - **Abstract**
 The paper presents results of studying the kinematics of the ionized gas in the galaxy of the Large Magellanic Cloud type NGC 7292 obtained with the 2.5-m telescope of the Caucasian Mountain Observatory (CMO SAI MSU) and the 6-m BTA telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory (SAO RAS). Analysis of the velocity fields of the ionized and neutral hydrogen showed that the kinematic center of NGC 7292 located at the center of the bar, northwest of the photometric center of the galaxy (the southeastern end of the bar) previously taken as the center of NGC 7292. In addition to the circular rotation of the gas, the radial motions associated with the bar play a significant role in the kinematics of the disk. The observed perturbations of the gaseous-disk kinematics induced by the ongoing star formation do not exceed those caused by the bar. It is possible that part of the non-circular motions (at the southeastern end of the bar which is the brightest HII region) may be related to the effects of the capture of a dwarf companion or a gaseous cloud.
