 - **Abstract**
 Pristine_183.6849+04.8619 (P1836849) is an extremely metal-poor ([Fe/H]$=-3.3\pm0.1$) star on a prograde orbit confined to the Galactic disk. Such stars are rare and may have their origins in protogalactic fragments that formed the early Milky Way, in low mass satellites that were later accreted by the Galaxy, or forming in situ in the Galactic plane. Here we present a chemo-dynamical analysis of the spectral features between $3700-11000$\r{A} from a high-resolution spectrum taken during Science Verification of the new Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph (GHOST). Spectral features for many chemical elements are analysed (Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni), and valuable upper limits are determined for others (C, Na, Sr, Ba), which are all important tracers of the earliest epochs of star formation in the Galaxy. This main sequence star exhibits several rare chemical signatures, including (i) extremely low metallicity for a star in the Galactic disk, (ii) very low abundances of the light $\alpha$-elements (Na, Mg, Si) compared to metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo or disk, and (iii) unusually large abundances of Cr and Mn, where [Cr, Mn/Fe]$_{\rm NLTE}>+0.5$. A simple comparison to theoretical yields from supernova models suggests that two low mass Population III objects (one 10 M$_\odot$ supernova and one 17 M$_\odot$ hypernova) can reproduce the abundance pattern well (reduced $\chi^2<1$). When this star is compared to two other extremely metal-poor stars with planar orbits, differences in both chemistry and kinematics imply there is little evidence for a common origin. The unique chemistry of P1836849 is discussed in terms of the earliest stages in the formation of the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 In the core accretion model of planet formation, envelope cooling regulates the accretion of material and ultimately sets the timescale to form a giant planet. Given the diversity of planet-forming environments, opacity uncertainties, and the advective transport of energy by 3-dimensional recycling flows, it is unclear whether 1D models can adequately describe envelope structure and accretion in all regimes. Even in 3D models, it is unclear whether approximate radiative transfer methods sufficiently model envelope cooling particularly at the planetary photosphere. To address these uncertainties, we present a suite of 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations employing methods that directly solve the transfer equation. We perform a parameter space study, formulated in terms of dimensionless parameters, for a variety of envelope optical depths and cooling times. We find that the thermodynamic structure of the envelope ranges from adiabatic to isothermal based on the cooling time and by extension, the background disk temperature and density. Our models show general agreement with 1D static calculations, suggesting a limited role of recycling flows in determining envelope structure. By adopting a dimensionless framework, these models can be applied to a wide range of formation conditions and assumed opacities. In particular, we dimensionalize them to the case of a super-Earth and proto-Jupiter and place upper limits on the 3D mass accretion rates prior to runaway growth. Finally, we evaluate the fidelity of approximate radiative transfer methods and find that even in the most challenging cases, more approximate methods are sufficiently accurate and worth their savings in computational cost.
#### JWST transmission spectroscopy of HD 209458b: a super-solar metallicity,  a very low C/O, and no evidence of CH4, HCN, or C2H2

 - **Abstract**
 We present the transmission spectrum of the original transiting hot Jupiter HD\,209458b from 2.3 -- 5.1\,$\mu$m as observed with the NIRCam instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Previous studies of HD\,209458b's atmosphere have given conflicting results on the abundance of H$_2$O and the presence of carbon- and nitrogen-bearing species, which have significant ramifications on the inferences of the planet's metallicity (M/H) and carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio. We detect strong features of H$_2$O and CO$_2$ in the JWST transmission spectrum, which when interpreted using a retrieval that assumes thermochemical equilibrium and fractional grey cloud opacity yields $4^{+5}_{-2}$ $\times$ solar metallicity and C/O = $0.08^{+0.09}_{-0.05}$. The derived metallicity is consistent with the atmospheric metallicity-planet mass trend observed in solar gas giants. The low C/O ratio suggests that this planet has undergone significant contamination by evaporating planetesimals while migrating inward. We are also able to place upper limits on the abundances of CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN of log($\chi_{\mathrm{CH}_4}$) = -4.4, log($\chi_{\mathrm{C}_2\mathrm{H}_2}$) = -5.3, and log($\chi_{\mathrm{HCN}}$) = -5.5, which are in tension with the recent claim of a detection of these species using ground-based cross-correlation spectroscopy. We find that HD\,209458b has a weaker CO$_2$ feature size than WASP-39b when comparing their scale-height-normalized transmission spectra. On the other hand, the size of HD\,209458b's H$_2$O feature is stronger, thus reinforcing the low C/O inference.

 - **Abstract**
 We carried out a sensitive survey of C$_2$ and C$_3$ using the EDIBLES data set. We also expanded our searches to C$_4$, C$_5$, and $^{13}$C$^{12}$C isotopologue in the most molecule-rich sightlines. We fit synthetic spectra generated following a physical excitation model to the C$_2$ (2-0) Phillips band to obtain the C$_2$ column density ($N$) as well as the kinetic temperature ($T_\textrm{kin}$) and number density ($n$) of the host cloud. The C$_3$ molecule was measured through its $\tilde{A} - \tilde{X}$ (000-000) electronic origin band system. We simulated the excitation of this band with a double-temperature Boltzmann distribution. We present the largest combined survey of C$_2$ and C$_3$ to date in which the individual transitions can be resolved. In total we detected C$_2$ in 51 velocity components along 40 sightlines, and C$_3$ in 31 velocity components along 27 sightlines. The two molecules are detected in the same velocity components. We find a very good correlation between $N$(C$_2$) and $N$(C$_3$) with Pearson $r = 0.93$ and an average $N$(C$_2$)/$N$(C$_3$) ratio of 15.5$\pm$1.4. A comparison with the behaviour of the C$_2$ DIBs shows that there are no clear differences among sightlines with and without detection of C$_2$ and C$_3$. This is in direct contrast to the better-studied non-C$_2$ DIBs who have reduced strengths in molecule-rich environments. We also identify for the first time the $Q$(2), $Q$(3), and $Q$(4) transitions of the $^{13}$C$^{12}$C (2-0) Phillips band in a stacked average spectrum, and estimate the isotopic ratio of carbon $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C as 79$\pm$8. Our search for the C$_4$ and C$_5$ optical bands was unsuccessful.

 - **Abstract**
 The S254-258 star-forming complex is a place of massive star formation where five OB-stars have created HII regions, visible as optical nebulae, and disrupted the parental molecular gas. In this work, we study the 3D structure of these \HII regions using optical spectroscopy and tunable-filter photometry with the 6-m and 1-m telescopes of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. We construct maps of the optical extinction, and find that the HII emission is attenuated by neutral material with $2 \leq A_V \leq 5$ mag. The typical electron density in S255, and S257 is $\approx 100$ cm$^{-3}$, with enhancements up to 200 cm$^{-3}$ in their borders, and up to 400 cm$^{-3}$ toward the dense molecular cloud between them, where active star formation is taking place. We show that either a model of a clumpy dense neutral shell, where UV~photons penetrate through and ionize the gas, or a stellar wind, can explain the shell-like structure of the ionized gas. S255 is surrounded by neutral material from all sides, but S257 is situated on the border of a molecular cloud and does not have dense front and rear walls. The compact HII regions S256 and S258 are deeply embedded in the molecular clouds.
#### HST FUV Spectroscopy of Super Star Cluster A in the Green Pea Analog Mrk  71: Revealing the Presence of Very Massive Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Mrk 71 is a low metallicity (Z = 0.16 Z_sun) starburst region in the local dwarf galaxy NGC 2366, hosting two super star clusters (SSCs A and B), and is recognized as a Green Pea (GP) analog with SSC A responsible for the GP properties. We present STIS and FOS far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra of the embedded SSC Mrk 71-A obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The STIS FUV spectrum shows the characteristic features of very massive stars (VMS, masses > 100 M_sun) and we derive an age of 1+/-1 Myr by comparison with the Charlot & Bruzual suite of spectral population synthesis models with upper mass limits of 300 and 600 M_sun. We compare the STIS spectrum with all known SSC spectra exhibiting VMS signatures: NGC 5253-5, R136a, NGC 3125-A1 and the z = 2.37 Sunburst cluster. We find that the cluster mass-loss rates and wind velocities, as characterized by the C IV P Cygni profiles and the He II emission line strengths, are very similar over Z = 0.16 to 0.4 Z_sun. This agrees with predictions that the optically thick winds of VMS will be enhanced near the Eddington limit and show little metallicity dependence. We find very strong damped Lyman-alpha absorption with log N(H I) = 22.2 cm-2 associated with Mrk 71-A. We discuss the natal environment of this young SSC in terms of radiatively-driven winds, catastrophic cooling and recent models where the cluster is surrounded by highly pressurized clouds with large neutral columns.

 - **Abstract**
 Fallback rate of debris after a partial tidal disruption event of a star with an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) might provide important signatures of such black holes, compared to supermassive ones. Here using smoothed particle hydrodynamics methods, we provide a comprehensive numerical analysis of this phenomenon. We perform numerical simulations of single partial tidal disruptions of solar mass white dwarfs in parabolic orbits, with a non-spinning $10^3M_{\odot}$ IMBH for various values of the impact parameter, and determine the core mass fractions and fallback rates of debris into the IMBH. For supermassive black holes, in a full disruption processes, it is known that the late time fallback rate follows a power law $t^{-5/3}$, whereas for partial disruptions, such a rate has been recently conjectured to saturate to a steeper power law $t^{-9/4}$, independent of the mass of the remnant core. We show here that for IMBHs, partial disruptions significantly alter this conclusion. That is, the fallback rate at late times do not asymptote to a $t^{-9/4}$ power law, and this rate is also a strong function of the core mass. We derive a robust formula for the late time fallback rate as a function of the core mass fraction, that is independent of the white dwarf mass, as we verify numerically by varying the mass of the white dwarf.
#### UV Fe II emission model and its relation to broad-line time delays for  HE 0413-4031 observed in the optical and IR bands

 - **Abstract**
 Fe II emission is a well-known contributor to the UV spectra of active galactic nuclei, and the modeling of this part may affect the results obtained for the MgII emission which is one of the lines used for black hole mass measurement and for cosmological applications. We test different Fe II emission models when modeling the UV emission of the intermediate-redshift quasar HE 0413-4031 with the aim of seeing how the use of a specific template affects the MgII line properties and the measurement of the MgII and UV FeII time delays with respect to the continuum. We use the 11-year monitoring of the selected quasar HE 0413-4031 with the South African Large Telescope (SALT), and we supplement this monitoring with the near-IR spectrum taken with the SOAR telescope which gave access to the H$\beta$ and [OIII] emission lines at the rest frame and allowed for a precise measurement of the redshift. A new redshift determination ($z=1.39117 \pm 0.00017$) using [OIII] lines gave a very different value than the previous determination based only on the UV FeII pseudocontinuum ($z=1.3764$). It favors a different decomposition of the spectrum into Mg II and UV Fe II emissions. The time delay of the Mg II emission ($224^{+21}_{-23}$ days) is not significantly affected. The rest-frame UV FeII time delay ($251^{+9}_{-7}$ days) is consistent with the best-fit FeII FWHM of $4200\,{\rm km/s}$, and hence the FeII-emitting material is more distant than MgII-emitting gas in HE 0413-4031 by 0.023 pc (4700 AU). Moreover, the velocity shift of both Mg II and UV Fe II lines with respect to the systemic redshift is now rather low, below 300 km s$^{-1}$. We construct an updated MgII radius-luminosity ($R-L$) relation from 194 sources, which is flatter than the UV FeII, optical FeII, and H$\beta$ $R-L$ relations. We see a need to create better Fe II templates using the newest version of the code CLOUDY.
#### A JWST survey of the Trapezium Cluster & inner Orion Nebula. I.  Observations & overview

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03552
 - **Abstract**
 We present a near-IR survey of the Trapezium Cluster and inner Orion Nebula using the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope. The survey with the NIRCam instrument covers 10.9 x 7.5 arcminutes (~1.25 x 0.85 pc) in twelve wide-, medium-, and narrow-band filters from 1-5 microns and is diffraction-limited at all wavelengths, providing a maximum spatial resolution of 0.063 arcsec at 2 microns, corresponding to ~25 au at Orion. The suite of filters chosen was designed to address a number of scientific questions including the form of the extreme low-mass end of the IMF into the planetary-mass range to 1 Jupiter mass and below; the nature of ionised and non-ionised circumstellar disks and associated proplyds in the near-IR with a similar resolution to prior HST studies; to examine the large fragmented outflow from the embedded BN-KL region at very high resolution and fidelity; and to search for new jets and outflows from young stars in the Trapezium Cluster and the Orion Molecular Cloud 1 behind. In this paper, we present a description of the design of the observational programme, explaining the rationale for the filter set chosen and the telescope and detector modes used to make the survey; the reduction of the data using the JWST pipeline and other tools; the creation of large colour mosaics covering the region; and an overview of the discoveries made in the colour images and in the individual filter mosaics. Highlights include the discovery of large numbers of free-floating planetary-mass candidates as low as 0.6 Jupiter masses, a significant fraction of which are in wide binaries; new emission phenomena associated with the explosive outflow from the BN-KL region; and a mysterious "dark absorber" associated with a number of disparate features in the region, but which is seen exclusively in the F115W filter. Further papers will examine those discoveries and others in more detail.
#### On the effect of tidal deformation on planetary phase curves

 - **Abstract**
 With the continuous improvement in the precision of exoplanet observations, it has become feasible to probe for subtle effects that can enable a more comprehensive characterization of exoplanets. A notable example is the tidal deformation of ultra-hot Jupiters by their host stars, whose detection can provide valuable insights into the planetary interior structure. In this work, we extend previous research on modeling deformation in transit light curves by proposing a simple approach to account for tidal deformation in phase curves. The planetary shape is modeled as a function of the second fluid Love number for radial deformation $h_{2f}$. We show that the effect of tidal deformation manifests across the full orbit of the planet as its projected area varies with phase, thereby allowing us to better probe the planet's shape in phase curves than in transits. Comparing the effects and detectability of deformation by different space-based instruments, we find that the effect of deformation is more prominent in infrared observations where the phase curve amplitude is the largest. A single JWST phase curve observation of a deformed planet, such as WASP-12b, can allow up to 17$\sigma$ measurement of $h_{2f}$ compared to 4$\sigma$ from transit-only observation. Such high precision $h_{2f}$ measurement can constrain the core mass of the planet to within 19\% of the total mass, thus providing unprecedented constraints on the interior structure. Due to the lower phase curve amplitudes in the optical, the other instruments provide $\leq4\sigma$ precision on $h_{2f}$ depending on the number of phase curves observed. We also find that detecting deformation from infrared phase curves is less affected by uncertainty in limb darkening, unlike detection in transits. Finally, the assumption of sphericity when analyzing the phase curve of deformed planets can lead to biases in several system parameters
#### Where are the Water Worlds? Identifying the Exo-water-worlds Using  Models of Planet Formation and Atmospheric Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 Planet formation models suggest that the small exoplanets that migrate from beyond the snowline of the protoplanetary disk likely contain water-ice-rich cores ($\sim 50\%$ by mass), also known as the water worlds. While the observed radius valley of the Kepler planets is well explained with the atmospheric dichotomy of the rocky planets, precise measurements of mass and radius of the transiting planets hint at the existence of these water worlds. However, observations cannot confirm the core compositions of those planets owing to the degeneracy between the density of a bare water-ice-rich planet and the bulk density of a rocky planet with a thin atmosphere. We combine different formation models from the Genesis library with atmospheric escape models, such as photo-evaporation and impact stripping, to simulate planetary systems consistent with the observed radius valley. We then explore the possibility of water worlds being present in the currently observed sample by comparing them with the simulated planets in the mass-radius-orbital period space. We find that the migration models suggest $\gtrsim 10\%$ and $\gtrsim 20\%$ of the bare planets, i.e. planets without primordial H/He atmospheres, to be water-ice-rich around G- and M-type host stars respectively, consistent with the mass-radius distributions of the observed planets. However, most of the water worlds are predicted to be outside a period of 10 days. A unique identification of water worlds through radial velocity and transmission spectroscopy is likely to be more successful when targeting such planets with longer orbital periods.
#### Methods for Incorporating Model Uncertainty into Exoplanet Atmospheric  Analysis

 - **Abstract**
 A key goal of exoplanet spectroscopy is to measure atmospheric properties, such as abundances of chemical species, in order to connect them to our understanding of atmospheric physics and planet formation. In this new era of high-quality JWST data, it is paramount that these measurement methods are robust. When comparing atmospheric models to observations, multiple candidate models may produce reasonable fits to the data. Typically, conclusions are reached by selecting the best-performing model according to some metric. This ignores model uncertainty in favour of specific model assumptions, potentially leading to measured atmospheric properties that are overconfident and/or incorrect. In this paper, we compare three ensemble methods for addressing model uncertainty by combining posterior distributions from multiple analyses: Bayesian model averaging, a variant of Bayesian model averaging using leave-one-out predictive densities, and stacking of predictive distributions. We demonstrate these methods by fitting the HST+Spitzer transmission spectrum of the hot Jupiter HD 209458b using models with different cloud and haze prescriptions. All of our ensemble methods lead to uncertainties on retrieved parameters that are larger, but more realistic, and consistent with physical and chemical expectations. Since they have not typically accounted for model uncertainty, uncertainties of retrieved parameters from HST spectra have likely been underreported. We recommend stacking as the most robust model combination method. Our methods can be used to combine results from independent retrieval codes, and from different models within one code. They are also widely applicable to other exoplanet analysis processes, such as combining results from different data reductions.
