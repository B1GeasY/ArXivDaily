 - **Abstract**
 We present the results obtained from follow-up observations of the MUSE Ultra Deep Field (MUDF) at X-ray energies with XMM-Newton. The MUDF is centred on a unique field with two bright, physically associated quasars at $z\simeq3.23$, separated by $\sim$500 kpc in projection. Both quasars are embedded within extended Ly$\alpha$ nebulae ($\gtrsim 100~\rm kpc$ at a surface brightness flux level of $\approx 6\times 10^{-19} \rm erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}~arcsec^{-2}$), whose elongated morphology is suggestive of an extended filament connecting the quasar haloes. The new X-ray observations presented here allow us to characterise the physical properties (e.g. X-ray slope, luminosities, gas column densities) in the innermost region of the MUDF quasars. We find that both quasars are X-ray underluminous compared to objects at similar ultraviolet luminosities. Based on our X-ray spectral analysis, absorbing columns of $N_H(z)\gtrsim$ 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ appear unlikely, therefore such a weakness is possibly intrinsic. When also including literature data, we do not observe any detectable trend between the area of the nebulae and nuclear luminosities at both the rest-frame 2 keV and 2500 $\rm \mathring{A}$. The area is also not correlated with the X-ray photon index nor with the integrated band flux in the hard band (2$-$10 keV). We also do not find any trend between the extended Ly$\alpha$ emission of the nebulae and the nuclear X-ray luminosity. Finally, the properties of the MUDF quasars' nebulae are consistent with the observed relation between the Ly$\alpha$ integrated luminosity of the nebulae and their area. Our results suggest that the quasar ionization power is not a strong driver of the morphology and size of the nebulae.
#### The Dusty Rossby Wave Instability (DRWI): Linear Analysis and  Simulations of Turbulent Dust-Trapping Rings in Protoplanetary Discs

 - **Abstract**
 Recent numerical simulations have revealed that dust clumping and planetesimal formation likely proceed in ring-like disc substructures, where dust gets trapped in weakly turbulent pressure maxima. The streaming instability has difficulty operating in such rings with external turbulence and no pressure gradient. To explore potential paths to planetesimal formation in this context, we analyse the stability of turbulent dust-trapping ring under the shearing sheet framework. We self-consistently establish the pressure maximum and the dust ring in equilibrium, the former via a balance of external forcing versus viscosity and the latter via dust drift versus turbulent diffusion. We find two types of $\gtrsim H$-scale instabilities ($H$ being the pressure scale height), which we term the dusty Rossby wave instability (DRWI). Type I is generalised from the standard RWI, which is stationary at the pressure maximum and dominates in relatively sharp pressure bumps. Type II is a newly identified travelling mode that requires the presence of dust. It can operate in relatively mild bumps, including many that are stable to the standard RWI, and its growth rate is largely determined by the equilibrium gas and dust density gradients. We further conduct two-fluid simulations that verify the two types of the DRWI. While Type I leads strong to dust concentration into a large gas vortex similar to the standard RWI, the dust ring is preserved in Type II, and meanwhile exhibiting additional clumping within the ring. The DRWI suggests a promising path towards formation of planetesimals/planetary embryos and azimuthally asymmetric dust structure from turbulent dust-trapping rings.
#### Unraveling the Effects of Dense Medium on a Near to Bohm-Limit  Acceleration in Kepler's SNR

 - **Abstract**
 The maximum energy of electrons accelerated by supernova remnants (SNR) is typically limited by radiative losses. In this scenario, the synchrotron cooling time scale is equal to the acceleration time scale. On the other hand, the low propagation speed of a shock in a dense medium is expected to result in an extended acceleration time scale, thus inducing a decrease in the maximum electron energy for a given SNR age and in the X-ray nonthermal flux. The young Kepler's SNR shows an enhanced efficiency of the acceleration process, which is close to the Bohm limit in the north of its shell, where the shock is slowed down by a dense circumstellar medium. Conversely, in the south, where no interaction with a dense medium is evident and the shock speed is high, the acceleration proceeds with a higher Bohm factor. To investigate this scenario, we studied the temporal evolution of the non-thermal emission, taking advantage of two Chandra X-ray observations of Kepler's SNR (performed in 2006 and 2014). We analyzed the spectra of different filaments both in the north and south of the shell, and measured their proper motion. We found a region with low shock velocity where we measured a significant decrease in flux from 2006 to 2014. This could be the first evidence of fading synchrotron emission in Kepler's SNR. This result suggests that under a certain threshold of shock speed the acceleration process could exit the loss-limited regime.
