#### Neutrino trapping and out-of-equilibrium effects in binary neutron star  merger remnants

 - **Abstract**
 We study out-of-thermodynamic equilibrium effects in neutron star mergers with 3D general-relativistic neutrino-radiation large-eddy simulations. During merger, the cores of the neutron stars remain cold ($T \sim$ a few MeV) and out of thermodynamic equilibrium with trapped neutrinos originating from the hot collisional interface between the stars. However, within ${\sim}2{-}3$ milliseconds matter and neutrinos reach equilibrium everywhere in the remnant. Our results show that dissipative effects, such as bulk viscosity, if present, are only active for a short window of time after the merger.

 - **Abstract**
 A key event in the history of the Milky Way is the formation of the bar. This event affects the subsequent structural and dynamical evolution of the entire Galaxy. When the bar formed, gas was likely rapidly funnelled to the centre of the Galaxy settling in a star-forming nuclear disc. The Milky Way bar formation can then be dated by considering the oldest stars in the formed nuclear stellar disc. In this highly obscured and crowded region, reliable age tracers are limited, but bright, high-amplitude Mira variables make useful age indicators as they follow a period--age relation. We fit dynamical models to the proper motions of a sample of Mira variables in the Milky Way's nuclear stellar disc region. Weak evidence for inside-out growth and both radial and vertical dynamical heating with time of the nuclear stellar disc is presented suggesting the nuclear stellar disc is dynamically well-mixed. Furthermore, for Mira variables around a $\sim350$ day period, there is a clear transition from nuclear stellar disc-dominated kinematics to background bar-bulge-dominated kinematics. Using a Mira variable period-age relation calibrated in the solar neighbourhood, this suggests the nuclear stellar disc formed in a significant burst in star formation $(8\pm 1)\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ ago, although the data are also weakly consistent with a more gradual formation of the nuclear stellar disc at even earlier epochs. This implies a relatively early formation time for the Milky Way bar ($\gtrsim8\,\mathrm{Gyr}$), which has implications for the growth and state of the young Milky Way and its subsequent history.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the CO(3-2) APEX survey at 6 pc resolution of the bar of the SMC. We aboard the CO analysis in the SMC-Bar comparing the CO(3-2) survey with that of the CO(2-1) of similar resolution. We study the CO(3-2)-to-CO(2-1) ratio (R32) that is very sensitive to the environment properties (e.g., star-forming regions). We analyzed the correlation of this ratio with observational quantities that trace the star formation as the local CO emission, the Spitzer color [70/160], and the total IR surface brightness measured from the Spitzer and Herschel bands. For the identification of the CO(3-2) clouds, we used the CPROPS algorithm, which allowed us to measure the physical properties of the clouds. We analyzed the scaling relationships of such physical properties. We obtained an R32 of 0.65 as a median value for the SMC, with a standard deviation of 0.3. We found that R32 varies from region to region, depending on the star formation activity. In regions dominated by HII and photo-dissociated regions (e.g., N22, N66), R32 tends to be higher than the median values. Meanwhile, lower values were found toward quiescent clouds. We also found that R32 correlates positively with the IR color [70/160] and the total IR surface brightness. This finding indicates that R32 increases with environmental properties like the dust temperature, the total gas density, and the radiation field. We have identified 225 molecular clouds with sizes R > 1.5 pc and signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio > 3 and only 17 well-resolved CO(3-2) clouds increasing the S/N ratio to > 5. These 17 clouds follow consistent scaling relationships to the inner Milky Way clouds but with some departure. The CO(3-2) tends to be less turbulent and less luminous than the inner Milky Way clouds of similar size. Finally, we estimated a median virial-based CO-to-H2 conversion factor of 12.6_{-7}^{+10} Msun/(K km s^{-1} pc^{2}) for the total sample.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery and timing results of five pulsars discovered in a pilot survey at intermediate Galactic latitudes with the Five-hundred Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). Among these pulsars, two belong to the category of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) with spin periods of less than 20\,ms. Two others fall under the classification of `mildly recycled' pulsars, with massive white dwarfs as companions. Remarkably, this small survey, covering an area of 4.7 square degrees, led to the discovery of five pulsars, including four recycled pulsars. Such success underscores the immense potential of future surveys at intermediate Galactic latitudes. In order to assess the potential yield of MSPs, we conducted population simulations and found that both FAST and Parkes new Phased Array Feed surveys, focusing on intermediate Galactic latitudes, have the capacity to uncover several hundred new MSPs.
#### Near-IR Spectral Observations of the Didymos System -- Daily Evolution  Before and After the DART Impact, Indicates Dimorphos Originated from Didymos

 - **Abstract**
 Ejecta from Dimorphos following the DART mission impact, significantly increased the brightness of the Didymos-Dimorphos system, allowing us to examine sub-surface material. We report daily near-IR spectroscopic observations of the Didymos system using NASA's IRTF, that follow the evolution of the spectral signature of the ejecta cloud over one week, from one day before the impact. Overall, the spectral features remained fixed (S-type classification) while the ejecta dissipated, confirming both Didymos and Dimorphos are constructed from the same silicate material. This novel result strongly supports binary asteroid formation models that include breaking up of a single body, due to rotational breakup of km-wide bodies. At impact time +14 and +38 hours, the spectral slope decreased, but following nights presented increasing spectral slope that almost returned to the pre-impact slope. However, the parameters of the $1~\mu m$ band remained fixed, and no "fresh" / Q-type-like spectrum was measured. We interpret these as follow: 1. The ejecta cloud is the main contributor ($60-70\%$) to the overall light during the $\sim40$ hours after impact. 2. Coarser debris ($\geq 100~\mu m$) dominated the ejecta cloud, decreasing the spectral slope (after radiation pressure removed the fine grains at $\leq10$ hours after impact); 3. after approximately one week, the ejecta cloud dispersed enough to make the fine grains on Didymos surface the dominating part of the light, increasing the spectral slope to pre-impact level. 4. a negligible amount of non-weathered material was ejected from Dimorphos' sub-surface, suggesting Dimorphos was accumulated from weathered material, ejected from Didymos surface.
#### Massive star-formation in the hub-filament system of RCW 117

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multiwavelength investigation of the hub-filament system RCW 117 (IRAS 17059-4132), which shows intricate filamentary features in the far-infrared, mapped using Herschel images. We obtain the column density and dust temperature maps for the region using the Herschel images, and identify 88 cores and 12 filaments from the column density map of the region ($18'\times18'$). We employ the ThrUMMS $^{13}$CO (J=1-0) data for probing the kinematics in RCW 117, and find velocity gradients ($\sim 0.3-1$ km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$) with hints of matter inflow along the filamentary structures. Ionised gas emission from the associated HII region is examined using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 610 and 1280 MHz, and is found to be of extent $5 \times 3$ pc$^2$ with intensity being brightest towards the hub. We estimate the peak electron density towards the hub to be $\sim 750$ cm$^{-3}$. Thirty four Class 0/I young stellar objects (YSOs) have been identified in the region using the Spitzer GLIMPSE colour-colour diagram, with many lying along the filamentary structures. Based on the (i) presence of filamentary structures, (ii) distribution of cores across the region, with $\sim39$% found along the filamentary structures, (iii) massive star-formation tracers in the hub, and (iv) the kinematics, we believe that global hierarchical collapse can plausibly explain the observed features in RCW 117.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar dust (ISD) particles penetrate the solar system due to the relative motion of the Sun and the local interstellar cloud. Before entering the heliosphere, they pass through the heliospheric interface - the region of the solar wind interaction with the interstellar plasma. The size distribution and number density of dust grains are modified in the interface essentially. The modification depends on the charging of the dust particles along their trajectories. In this paper, we present modeling results of the charging of ISD particles passing through the heliospheric interface. The main physical processes responsible for the charging within the heliospheric conditions are the sticking of primary plasma particles, secondary electron emission, photoemission, and the effects of cosmic ray electrons. We consider two methods to calculate the electric charge of ISD particles based on (1) the classic steady-state assumption that the charge depends only on local plasma and radiation conditions and (2) the dynamical computation of charge along the particle trajectory. We demonstrate that the steady-state assumption is quite justified to model trajectories and number density distributions of relatively big ISD grains (radius of 100 nm and larger) penetrating the heliosphere. The estimates show that ISD grains of these sizes require less than 0.25 years (distance of ~ 1 au) after transition from the LISM into the heliosphere to reach an equilibrium. For small particles (radius of 10 nm), the dynamical computation of charge influences the trajectories and modifies the number density substantially. The dust density accumulations are distributed within a more elongated region along the heliopause in case of dynamically changed charge as compared with the use of a steady-state charge approximation.

 - **Abstract**
 To investigate the relative amount of ejecta from high-mass versus intermediate-mass stars and to trace the chemical evolution of the Galaxy, we have performed with the IRAM 30m and the SMT 10m telescopes a systematic study of Galactic interstellar 18O/17O ratios toward a sample of 421 molecular clouds, covering a galactocentric distance range of 1-22 kpc. The results presented in this paper are based on the J=2-1 transition and encompass 364 sources showing both C18O and C17O detections. The previously suggested 18O/17O gradient is confirmed. For the 41 sources detected with both facilities, good agreement is obtained. A correlation of 18O/17O ratios with heliocentric distance is not found, indicating that beam dilution and linear beam sizes are not relevant. For the subsample of IRAM 30 m high-mass star-forming regions with accurate parallax distances, an unweighted fit gives 18O/17O = (0.12+-0.02)R_GC+(2.38+-0.13) with a correlation coefficient of R = 0.67. While the slope is consistent with our J=1-0 measurement, ratios are systematically lower. This should be caused by larger optical depths of C18O 2-1 lines, w.r.t the corresponding 1-0 transitions, which is supported by RADEX calculations and the fact that C18O/C17O is positively correlated with 13CO/C18O. After considering optical depth effects with C18O J=2-1 reaching typically an optical depth of 0.5, corrected 18O/17O ratios from the J=1-0 and J=2-1 lines become consistent. A good numerical fit to the data is provided by the MWG-12 model, including both rotating stars and novae.
