 - **Abstract**
 We advocate for a large scale imaging survey of nearby young moving groups and star-forming regions to directly detect exoplanets over an unexplored range of masses, ages and orbits. Discovered objects will be identified early enough in JWST's lifetime to leverage its unparalleled capabilities for long-term atmospheric characterisation, and will uniquely complement the known population of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. Furthermore, this survey will constrain the occurrence of the novel wide sub-Jovian exoplanet population, informing multiple theories of planetary formation and evolution. Observations with NIRCam F200W+F444W dual-band coronagraphy will readily provide sub-Jupiter mass sensitivities beyond ~0.4" (F444W) and can also be used to rule out some contaminating background sources (F200W). At this large scale, targets can be sequenced by spectral type to enable robust self-referencing for PSF subtraction. This eliminates the need for dedicated reference observations required by GO programs and dramatically increases the overall science observing efficiency. With an exposure of ~30 minutes per target, the sub-Jupiter regime can be explored across 250 targets for ~400 hours of exposure time including overheads. An additional, pre-allocated, ~100 hours of observing time would enable rapid multi-epoch vetting of the lowest mass detections (which are undetectable in F200W). The total time required for a survey such as this is not fixed, and could be scaled in conjunction with the minimum number of detected exoplanet companions.

 - **Abstract**
 The origins of the lunar magnetic anomalies and swirls have long puzzled scientists.The prevailing theory posits that an ancient lunar dynamo core field magnetized extralunar meteoritic materials, leading to the current remnant magnetic anomalies that shield against solar wind ions, thereby contributing to the formation of lunar swirls. Our research reveals that these lunar swirls are the result of ancient electrical currents that traversed the Moon's surface, generating powerful magnetizing fields impacting both native lunar rocks and extralunar projectile materials. We have reconstructed 3-D distribution maps of these ancient subsurface currents and developed coupling models of magnetic and electric fields that take into account the subsurface density in the prominent lunar maria and basins. Our simulations suggest these ancient currents could have reached density up to 13 A/m2, with surface magnetizing field as strong as 469 {\mu}T. We propose that these intense electrical current discharges in the crust originate from ancient interior dynamo activity.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) radio observations toward N49, one of the brightest extragalactic Supernova remnants (SNRs) located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Our new and archival ATCA radio observations were analysed along with $Chandra$ X-ray data. These observations show a prominent `bullet' shaped feature beyond the southwestern boundary of the SNR. Both X-ray morphology and radio polarisation analysis support a physical connection of this feature to the SNR. The 'bullet' feature's apparent velocity is estimated at $\sim$1300 km s$^{-1}$, based on its distance ($\sim$10 pc) from the remnant's geometric centre and estimated age ($\sim$7600 yrs). we estimated the radio spectral index, $\alpha= -0.55 \pm 0.03$ which is typical of middle-age SNRs. Polarisation maps created for N49 show low to moderate levels of mean fractional polarisation estimated at 7$\pm$1% and 10$\pm$1% for 5.5 and 9 GHz, respectively. These values are noticeably larger than found in previous studies. Moreover, the mean value for the Faraday rotation of SNR N49 from combining CABB data is 212$\pm$65 rad m$^{-2}$ and the maximum value of RM is 591$\pm$103 rad m$^{-2}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The performance of fiber-fed astronomical spectrographs is highly influenced by the properties of fibers. The near-field and far-field scrambling characteristics have a profound impact on the line spread function (LSF) of the spectra. Focal ratio degradation (FRD) influences the output beam size, thereby affecting the throughput, as well as the size of the collimator and dispersion elements. While previous research has indicated that these properties depend on the shape of the fiber core and showed that non-circular core fibers can yield uniform near-field scrambling, the result remains inconclusive for far-field. In this study, we investigate the near-field and far-field scrambling properties, along with the FRD, of 50-micron core fibers with different core geometries. We find that in addition to excellent near-field scrambling, octagonal-core fibers can also produce more uniform far-field output when compared to circular-core fibers. They also have less FRD effect when being fed with a f/3 beam.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of ionic, atomic, or molecular lines are performed to improve our understanding of the interstellar medium (ISM). However, the potential of a line to constrain the physical conditions of the ISM is difficult to assess quantitatively, because of the complexity of the ISM physics. The situation is even more complex when trying to assess which combinations of lines are the most useful. Therefore, observation campaigns usually try to observe as many lines as possible for as much time as possible. We search for a quantitative statistical criterion to evaluate the constraining power of a (or combination of) tracer(s) with respect to physical conditions in order to improve our understanding of the statistical relationships between ISM tracers and physical conditions and helps observers to motivate their observation proposals. The best tracers are obtained by comparing the mutual information between a physical parameter and different sets of lines. We apply this method to simulations of radio molecular lines emitted by a photodissociation region similar to the Horsehead Nebula that would be observed at the IRAM 30m telescope. We search for the best lines to constrain the visual extinction $A_v^{tot}$ or the far UV illumination $G_0$. The most informative lines change with the physical regime (e.g., cloud extinction). Short integration time of the CO isotopologue $J=1-0$ lines already yields much information on the total column density most regimes. The best set of lines to constrain the visual extinction does not necessarily combine the most informative individual lines. Precise constraints on $G_0$ are more difficult to achieve with molecular lines. They require spectral lines emitted at the cloud surface (e.g., [CII] and [CI] lines). This approach allows one to better explore the knowledge provided by ISM codes, and to guide future observation campaigns.

 - **Abstract**
 HCN molecules serve as an important tracer for chemical evolution of elemental nitrogen in the regions of star and planet formation. This is largely explained by the fact that N atoms and N$_2$ molecules are poorly accessible for the observation in the radio and infrared ranges. In turn, gas-phase HCN can be observed at various stages of star formation including disks arounds young stars, cometary comas and atmospheres of the planetary satellites. Despite the large geography of gas-phase observations, an identification of interstellar HCN ice is still lacking. In this work we present a series of infrared spectroscopic measurements performed at the new ultra-high vacuum cryogenic apparatus aiming to facilitate the search for interstellar HCN ice. A series of high resolution laboratory infrared spectra of HCN molecules embedded in the H$_2$O, H$_2$O:NH$_3$, CO, CO$_2$ and CH$_3$OH ices at 10~K temperature is obtained. These interstellar ice analogues aim to simulate the surroundings of HCN molecules by the main constituents of the icy mantles on the surface of the interstellar grains. In addition, the spectra of HCN molecules embedded in the solid C$_6$H$_6$, C$_5$H$_5$N and C$_6$H$_5$NH$_2$ are obtained to somehow simulate the interaction of HCN molecules with carbonaceous material of the grains rich in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The acquired laboratory spectroscopic data are compared with the publicly available results of NIRSpec James Webb Space Telescope observations towards quiescent molecular clouds performed by the ICEAge team.

 - **Abstract**
 We use data from the ALMA Evolutionary Study of High Mass Protocluster Formation in the Galaxy (ALMAGAL) survey to study 100 ALMAGAL regions at $\sim$ 1\arcsec~ resolution located between $\sim$ 2 and 6~kpc distance. Using ALMAGAL $\sim$ 1.3mm line and continuum data we estimate flow rates onto individual cores. We focus specifically on flow rates along filamentary structures associated with these cores. Our primary analysis is centered around position velocity cuts in H$_2$CO (3$_{0,3}$ - 2$_{0,2}$) which allow us to measure the velocity fields, surrounding these cores. Combining this work with column density estimates we derive the flow rates along the extended filamentary structures associated with cores in these regions. We select a sample of 100 ALMAGAL regions covering four evolutionary stages from quiescent to protostellar, Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), and \HII~regions (25 each). Using dendrogram and line analysis, we identify a final sample of 182 cores in 87 regions. In this paper, we present 728 flow rates for our sample (4 per core), analysed in the context of evolutionary stage, distance from the core, and core mass. On average, for the whole sample, we derive flow rates on the order of $\sim$10$^{-4}$ M$_{sun}$yr$^{-1}$ with estimated uncertainties of $\pm$50\%. We see increasing differences in the values among evolutionary stages, most notably between the less evolved (quiescent/protostellar) and more evolved (YSO/\HII~region) sources. We also see an increasing trend as we move further away from the centre of these cores. We also find a clear relationship between the flow rates and core masses $\sim$M$^{2/3}$ which is in line with the result expected from the tidal-lobe accretion mechanism. Overall, we see increasing trends in the relationships between the flow rate and the three investigated parameters; evolutionary stage, distance from the core, and core mass.

 - **Abstract**
 As a part of the Deciphering the Interplay between the Interstellar medium, Stars, and the Circumgalactic medium (DIISC) survey, we investigate indirect evidence of gas inflow into the disk of the galaxy NGC 99. We combine optical spectra from the Binospec spectrograph on the MMT telescope with optical imaging data from the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope, radio HI 21 cm emission images from the NSF Karl G. Jansky's Very Large Array, and UV spectroscopy from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. We measure emission lines (H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [O III]$\lambda5007$, [N II]$\lambda6583$, and [S II]$\lambda6717,31$) in 26 H II regions scattered about the galaxy and estimate a radial metallicity gradient of $-0.017$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ using the N2 metallicity indicator. Two regions in the sample exhibit an anomalously low metallicity (ALM) of 12+log(O/H) = 8.36 dex, which is $\sim$0.16 dex lower than other regions at that galactocentric radius. They also show a high difference between their HI and H$\alpha$ line of sight velocities on the order of 35 km s$^{-1}$. Chemical evolution modeling indicates gas accretion as the cause of the ALM regions. We find evidence for corotation between the interstellar medium of NGC 99 and Ly$\alpha$ clouds in its circumgalactic medium, which suggests a possible pathway for low metallicity gas accretion. We also calculate the resolved Fundamental Metallicity Relation (rFMR) on sub-kpc scales using localized gas-phase metallicity, stellar mass surface density, and star-formation rate surface density. The rFMR shows a similar trend as that found by previous localized and global FMR relations.
