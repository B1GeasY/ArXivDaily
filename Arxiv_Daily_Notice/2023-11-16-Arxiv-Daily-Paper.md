 - **Abstract**
 Some stars are known to explode at the end of their lives, called supernovae (SNe). The substantial amount of matter and energy that SNe release provides significant feedback to star formation and gas dynamics in a galaxy. SNe release a substantial amount of matter and energy to the interstellar medium, resulting in significant feedback to star formation and gas dynamics in a galaxy. While such feedback has a crucial role in galaxy formation and evolution, in simulations of galaxy formation, it has only been implemented using simple {\it sub-grid models} instead of numerically solving the evolution of gas elements around SNe in detail due to a lack of resolution. We develop a method combining machine learning and Gibbs sampling to predict how a supernova (SN) affects the surrounding gas. The fidelity of our model in the thermal energy and momentum distribution outperforms the low-resolution SN simulations. Our method can replace the SN sub-grid models and help properly simulate un-resolved SN feedback in galaxy formation simulations. We find that employing our new approach reduces the necessary computational cost to $\sim$ 1 percent compared to directly resolving SN feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents an overview of the QUARKS survey, which stands for `Querying Underlying mechanisms of massive star formation with ALMA-Resolved gas Kinematics and Structures'. The QUARKS survey is observing 139 massive clumps covered by 156 pointings at ALMA Band 6 ($\lambda\sim$ 1.3 mm). In conjunction with data obtained from the ALMA-ATOMS survey at Band 3 ($\lambda\sim$ 3 mm), QUARKS aims to carry out an unbiased statistical investigation of massive star formation process within protoclusters down to a scale of 1000 au. This overview paper describes the observations and data reduction of the QUARKS survey, and gives a first look at an exemplar source, the mini-starburst Sgr B2(M). The wide-bandwidth (7.5 GHz) and high-angular-resolution (~0.3 arcsec) observations of the QUARKS survey allow to resolve much more compact cores than could be done by the ATOMS survey, and to detect previously unrevealed fainter filamentary structures. The spectral windows cover transitions of species including CO, SO, N$_2$D$^+$, SiO, H$_{30}\alpha$, H$_2$CO, CH$_3$CN and many other complex organic molecules, tracing gas components with different temperatures and spatial extents. QUARKS aims to deepen our understanding of several scientific topics of massive star formation, such as the mass transport within protoclusters by (hub-)filamentary structures, the existence of massive starless cores, the physical and chemical properties of dense cores within protoclusters, and the feedback from already formed high-mass young protostars.
#### Post-inflationary structure formation boosted by parametric  self-resonance

 - **Abstract**
 The post-inflationary Universe can pass through a long epoch of effective matter-dominated expansion. This era may allow for both the parametric amplification of initial fluctuations and the gravitational collapse of inflaton perturbations. We perform first-of-their-kind high-resolution simulations that span the resonant phase and the subsequent gravitational collapse of the inflaton field by seguing from a full Klein-Gordon treatment of resonance to a computationally efficient Schr\"odinger-Poisson description that accurately captures the gravitational dynamics when most quanta are nonrelativistic. We consider a representative example in which resonance generates $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$ overdensities and gravitational collapse follows promptly as resonance ends. We observe the formation of solitonic cores inside inflaton halos and complex gravitational dynamics on scales of $10^{-27}\,\mathrm{m}$, greatly extending the possible scope of nonlinear post-inflationary gravitational dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 The tremendous tidal force that is linked to the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of our galaxy is expected to strongly subdue star formation in its vicinity. Stars within 1" from the SMBH thus likely formed further from the SMBH and migrated to their current positions. In this study, spectroscopic observations of the star S0-6/S10, one of the closest (projected distance from the SMBH of about 0.3") late-type stars were conducted. Using metal absorption lines in the spectra of S0-6, the radial velocity of S0-6 from 2014 to 2021 was measured, and a marginal acceleration was detected, which indicated that S0-6 is close to the SMBH. The S0-6 spectra were employed to determine its stellar parameters including temperature, chemical abundances ([M/H], [Fe/H], [alpha/Fe], [Ca/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Ti/Fe]), and age. As suggested by the results of this study, S0-6 is very old (> ~10 Gyr) and has an origin different from that of stars born in the central pc region.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are among the most energetic processes in our Universe and are crucial for the understanding of the formation and chemical composition of the Universe. The precise measurement of the neutrino light curve from CCSNe is crucial to understanding the hydrodynamics and fundamental processes that drive CCSNe. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has mass-independent sensitivity within the Milky Way and some sensitivity to the higher mass CCSNe in the Large and Small Magellanic clouds. The envisaged large-scale extension of the IceCube detector, IceCube-Gen2, opens the possibility for new sensor design and trigger concepts that could increase the number of neutrinos detected from a CCSNe burst compared to IceCube. In this contribution, we study how wavelength-shifting technology can be used in IceCube-Gen2 to measure the fast modulations of the neutrino signal due to standing accretion shock instabilities (SASI).
