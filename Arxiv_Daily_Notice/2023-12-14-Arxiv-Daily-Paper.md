 - **Abstract**
 There is probably not a black hole in the center of the sun. Despite this detail, our goal in this work to convince the reader that this question is interesting and that work studying stars with central black holes is well motivated. If primordial black holes exist then they may exist in sufficiently large numbers to explain the dark matter in the universe. While primordial black holes may form at almost any mass, the asteroid-mass window between $10^{-16} - 10^{-10} ~ \textrm{M}_\odot$ remains a viable dark matter candidate and these black holes could be captured by stars upon formation. Such a star, partially powered by accretion luminosity from a microscopic black hole in its core, has been called a `Hawking star.' Stellar evolution of Hawking stars is highly nontrivial and requires detailed stellar evolution models, which were developed in our recent work. We present here full evolutionary models of solar mass Hawking stars using two accretion schemes: one with a constant radiative efficiency, and one that is new in this work that uses an adaptive radiative efficiency to model the effects of photon trapping.

 - **Abstract**
 Observed high multiplicity planetary systems are often tightly packed. Numerical studies indicate that such systems are susceptible to dynamical instabilities. Dynamical instabilities in close-in tightly packed systems, similar to those found in abundance by Kepler, often lead to planet-planet collisions. For sub-Neptunes, the dominant type of observed exoplanets, the planetary mass is concentrated in a rocky core, but the volume is dominated by a low-density gaseous envelope. For these, using the traditional `sticky-sphere' assumption is questionable. Using both N-body integration and smoothed-particle hydrodynamics, we have simulated sub-Neptune collisions for a wide range in realistic kinematic properties such as impact parameters ($b^{\prime}$) and impact velocities ($v_{\rm{im}}$) to study the possible outcomes in detail. We find that the majority ($\sim 76\%$) of the collisions with kinematic properties similar to what is expected from dynamical instabilities in multiplanet systems may not lead to mergers of sub-Neptunes. Instead, the sub-Neptunes separate from each other, often with significant atmosphere loss. When mergers do occur, they can involve significant mass loss even from the core and can sometimes lead to complete disruption of one or both planets. Sub-Neptunes merge or disrupt if $b^{\prime}<b_{\rm{c}}$, a critical value dependent on $ v_{\rm{im}}/v_{\rm{esc}}$, where $v_{\rm{esc}}$ is the escape velocity from the surface of the hypothetical merged planet assuming sticky-sphere. For $ v_{\rm{im}}/v_{\rm{esc}}\lesssim2.5$, $b_{\rm{c}}\propto (v_{\rm{im}}/v_{\rm{esc}})^{-2}$, and collisions with $b^{\prime}<b_{\rm{c}}$ typically leads to mergers. On the other hand, for $ v_{\rm{im}}/v_{\rm{esc}}\gtrsim2.5$, $b_{\rm{c}}\propto v_{\rm{im}}/v_{\rm{esc}}$, and the collisions with $b^{\prime}<b_{\rm{c}}$ can result in complete destruction of one or both sub-Neptunes.

 - **Abstract**
 The structure and dynamics of the star-forming disk of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) have long confounded us. The SMC is widely used as a prototype for galactic physics at low metallicity, and yet we fundamentally lack an understanding of the structure of its interstellar medium (ISM). In this work, we present a new model for the SMC by comparing the kinematics of young, massive stars with the structure of the ISM traced by high-resolution observations of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) from the Galactic Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder survey (GASKAP-HI). Specifically, we identify thousands of young, massive stars with precise radial velocity constraints from the Gaia and APOGEE surveys and match these stars to the ISM structures in which they likely formed. By comparing the average dust extinction towards these stars, we find evidence that the SMC is composed of two structures with distinct stellar and gaseous chemical compositions. We construct a simple model that successfully reproduces the observations and shows that the ISM of the SMC is arranged into two, superimposed, star-forming systems with similar gas mass separated by ~5 kpc along the line of sight.
#### The Central Kinematics and Black Hole Mass of 4C+37.11

 - **Abstract**
 We report on IFU measurements of the host of the radio source 4C+37.11. This massive elliptical contains the only resolved double compact nucleus at pc-scale separation, likely a bound supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB). $i$-band photometry and GMOS-N IFU spectroscopy show that the galaxy has a large $r_b=1.5^{\prime\prime}$ core and that the stellar velocity dispersion increases inside of a radius of influence $r_{\rm SOI} \approx 1.3^{\prime\prime}$. Jeans Anisotropic Modeling analysis of the core infers a total SMBHB mass of $2.8^{+0.8}_{-0.8} \times 10^{10}M_\odot$, making this one of the most massive black hole systems known. Our data indicate that there has been significant scouring of the central kpc of the host galaxy.
#### Theoretical period-radius and period-luminosity relations for Mira  variables with solar metallicity

 - **Abstract**
 Evolutionary sequences of AGB stars with initial masses on the main sequence $M_\mathrm{ZAMS}=1.5M_\odot$, $2M_\odot$ and $3M_\odot$ were computed for the initial metallicity $Z=0.014$. Selected models of evolutionary sequences with envelopes under thermal equilibrium were used as initial conditions for calculation of nonlinear stellar pulsations. The hydrodynamic models of each evolutionary sequence are shown to concentrate along the continuous line in the period-radius and period-luminosity diagrams. The theoretical period-radius and period-luminosity relations differ from one another for different main-sequence star masses because the stellar luminosity of AGB stars depends on the degenerate carbon core mass which increases with increasing $M_\mathrm{ZAMS}$. In hydrodynamic models of evolutionary sequences $M_\mathrm{ZAMS}=2M_\odot$ and $M_\mathrm{ZAMS}=3M_\odot$ the periods of the first overtone pulsators are $86~\textrm{d}\le\Pi\le 123~\textrm{d}$ and $174~\textrm{d}\le\Pi\le 204~\textrm{d}$, whereas all models of the evolutionary sequence $M_\mathrm{ZAMS}=1.5M_\odot$ oscillate in the fundamental mode. Fairly regular radial oscillations exist in stars with pulsation periods $\Pi\lesssim 500$ d. In models with longer periods the amplitude rapidly increases with increasing $\Pi$ and oscillations become irregular.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite a rich observational background, few spectroscopic studies have dealt with the measurement of the carbon isotopic ratio in giant stars. However, it is a key element in understanding the mixing mechanisms that occur in the interiors of giant stars. We present the CNO and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C abundances derived for 71 giant field stars. Then, using this new catalogue and complementary data from the Kepler and Gaia satellites, we study the efficiency of mixing occurring in the giant branch as a function of the stellar properties. We have determined the abundances of CNO and more specifically 12C/13C using the FIES Spectrograph on the Nordic Optical Telescope, for 71 giant field stars. In addition, asteroseismology is available for all stars, providing their mass, age as well as the evolutionary states. Finally, astrometry from Gaia data is also available for the majority of the sample. We compare these new determinations with stellar evolution models taking into account the effects of transport processes. To exploit the complete potential of our extensive catalogue and considering both the Galactic evolution and the impact of stellar evolution, we built mock catalogues using the Besancon Galaxy model in which stellar evolution models taking into account the effects of thermohaline instability are included. We confirm that 12C/13C at the surface of core He-burning stars is lower than that of first ascent RGB stars. 12C/13C measured at the surface of the core He-burning stars increases with [Fe/H] and mass while it decreases with age. These trends are all very well explained by the thermohaline mixing that occurs in red giants. We have shown that our models can explain the behaviour of 12C/13C versus N/O, although the observations seem to show a lower N/O than the models. We also note that more constraints on the thick disc core He-burning stars are needed to understand this difference.

 - **Abstract**
 The High-Resolution Multi-Object Spectrograph (HRMOS) is a facility instrument that we plan to propose for the Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the European Southern Observatory (ESO), following the initial presentation at the VLT 2030 workshop held at ESO in June 2019. HRMOS provides a combination of capabilities that are essential to carry out breakthrough science across a broad range of active research areas from stellar astrophysics and exoplanet studies to Galactic and Local Group archaeology. HRMOS fills a gap in capabilities amongst the landscape of future instrumentation planned for the next decade. The key characteristics of HRMOS will be high spectral resolution (R = 60000 - 80000) combined with multi-object (20-100) capabilities and long term stability that will provide excellent radial velocity precision and accuracy (10m/s). Initial designs predict that a SNR~100 will be achievable in about one hour for a star with mag(AB) = 15, while with the same exposure time a SNR~ 30 will be reached for a star with mag(AB) = 17. The combination of high resolution and multiplexing with wavelength coverage extending to relatively blue wavelengths (down to 380\,nm), makes HRMOS a spectrograph that will push the boundaries of our knowledge and that is envisioned as a workhorse instrument in the future. The science cases presented in this White Paper include topics and ideas developed by the Core Science Team with the contributions from the astronomical community, also through the wide participation in the first HRMOS Workshop (https://indico.ict.inaf.it/event/1547/) that took place in Firenze (Italy) in October 2021.
#### VLTI/GRAVITY Provides Evidence the Young, Substellar Companion HD 136164  Ab formed like a "Failed Star"

 - **Abstract**
 Young, low-mass Brown Dwarfs orbiting early-type stars, with low mass ratios ($q\lesssim0.01$), appear intrinsically rare and present a formation dilemma: could a handful of these objects be the highest mass outcomes of ``planetary" formation channels (bottom up within a protoplanetary disk), or are they more representative of the lowest mass ``failed binaries" (formed via disk fragmentation, or core fragmentation)? Additionally, their orbits can yield model-independent dynamical masses, and when paired with wide wavelength coverage and accurate system age estimates, can constrain evolutionary models in a regime where the models have a wide dispersion depending on initial conditions. We present new interferometric observations of the $16\,\mathrm{Myr}$ substellar companion HD~136164~Ab (HIP~75056~Ab) with VLTI/GRAVITY and an updated orbit fit including proper motion measurements from the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalogue of Accelerations. We estimate a dynamical mass of $35\pm10\,\mathrm{M_J}$ ($q\sim0.02$), making HD~136164~Ab the youngest substellar companion with a dynamical mass estimate. The new mass and newly constrained orbital eccentricity ($e=0.44\pm0.03$) and separation ($22.5\pm1\,\mathrm{au}$) could indicate that the companion formed via the low-mass tail of the Initial Mass Function. Our atmospheric fit to the \texttt{SPHINX} M-dwarf model grid suggests a sub-solar C/O ratio of $0.45$, and $3\times$ solar metallicity, which could indicate formation in the circumstellar disk via disk fragmentation. Either way, the revised mass estimate likely excludes ``bottom-up" formation via core accretion in the circumstellar disk. HD~136164~Ab joins a select group of young substellar objects with dynamical mass estimates; epoch astrometry from future \textit{Gaia} data releases will constrain the dynamical mass of this crucial object further.

 - **Abstract**
 1D stellar evolution calculations produce uncertain predictions for quantities like the age, core mass, core compactness, and nucleo-synthetic yields; a key source of uncertainty is the modeling of interfaces between regions that are convectively stable and those that are not. Theoretical and numerical work has demonstrated that there should be numerous processes adjacent to the convective boundary that induce chemical and angular momentum transport, as well as modify the thermal structure of the star. One such process is called convective penetration, wherein vigorous convection extends beyond the nominal convective boundary and alters both the composition and thermal structure. In this work, we incorporate the process of convective penetration in stellar evolution calculations using the stellar evolution software instrument mesa. We implement convective penetration according to the description presented by Anders et al. (2022a) to calculate a grid of models from the pre main sequence to He core depletion. The extent of the convective penetration zone is self-consistently calculated at each time step without introducing new free parameters. We find both a substantial penetration zone in all models with a convective core and observable differences to global stellar properties such as the luminosity and radius. We preset how the predicted radial extent of the penetration zone scales with the total stellar mass, age and the metallicity of the star. We discuss our results in the context of existing numerical and observational studies.
