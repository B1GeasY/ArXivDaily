 - **Abstract**
 Large impacts onto young rocky planets may transform their compositions, creating highly reducing conditions at their surfaces and reintroducing highly siderophile metals to their mantles. Key to these processes is the availability of an impactor's chemically reduced core material (metallic iron). It is, therefore, important to constrain how much of an impactor's core remains accessible to a planet's mantle/surface, how much is sequestered to its core, and how much escapes. Here, we present 3D simulations of such impact scenarios using the shock physics code iSALE to determine the fate of impactor iron. iSALE's inclusion of material strength is vital in capturing the behavior of both solid and fluid components of the planet and thus characterizing iron sequestration to the core. We find that the mass fractions of impactor core material that accretes to the planet core ($f_{core}$) or escapes ($f_{esc}$) can be readily parameterized as a function of a modified specific impact energy, with $f_{core} > f_{esc}$ for a wide set of impacts. These results differ from previous works that do not incorporate material strength. Our work shows that large impacts can place substantial reducing impactor core material in the mantles of young rocky planets. Impact-generated reducing atmospheres may thus be common for such worlds. However, through escape and sequestration to a planet's core, large fractions of an impactor's core can be geochemically hidden from a planet's mantle. Consequently, geochemical estimates of late bombardments of planets based on mantle siderophile element abundances may be underestimates.

 - **Abstract**
 Deuterated molecules are valuable probes for investigating the evolution and the kinematics in the earliest stages of star formation. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive investigation by performing a single point survey of 101 starless clump candidates, and carrying out on-the-fly (OTF) observations of 11 selected sources, focusing on deuterated molecular lines using the IRAM 30-m telescope. In the single-point observation, we make 46 detections for DCO$^{+}$ J=1$-$0, 12 for DCN J=1$-$0, 51 for DNC J=1$-$0, 7 for N$_{2}$D$^{+}$ J=1$-$0, 20 for DCO$^{+}$ J=2$-$1, and 10 for DCN J=2$-$1. The starless clump candidates (SCCs) with deuterated molecule detections exhibit lower median kinetic temperatures and narrower H$_{2}$CO (1$_{(0,1)}$$-$0$_{(0,0)}$) median full width at half maximum (FWHM) compared to those without such detections, while simultaneously displaying similar median values of 1.1mm intensity, mass, and distance. Furthermore, our OTF observations reveal that deuterated molecules predominantly have peaks near the 1.1mm continuum peaks, with the DCO$^{+}$ J=1$-$0 emission demonstrating higher intensity in the deuterated peak region compared to the DCN and DNC J=1$-$0 emissions. Additionally, the majority of emissions from deuterated molecules and $^{13}$C$-$isotopologues exhibit peak positions close to those of the 1.1mm continuum peaks. By analyzing the 20"$\times$20" regions with strongest deuterated emissions in the OTF observations, we estimated deuterated abundances of 0.004$-$0.045, 0.011$-$0.040, and 0.004$-$0.038 for D$_{\rm frac}$(HCN), D$_{\rm frac}$(HCO$^{+}$), and D$_{\rm frac}$(HNC), respectively. The differential detection of deuterated molecular lines in our OTF observations could be attributed to variations in critical densities and formation pathways.
#### Neutrino-Driven Outflows and the Elemental Abundance Patterns of Very  Metal-Poor Stars

 - **Abstract**
 The elemental abundances between strontium and silver ($Z = 38-47$) observed in the atmospheres of very metal-poor stars (VMP) in the Galaxy may contain the fingerprint of the weak $r$-process and $\nu p$-process occurring in early core-collapse supernovae explosions. In this work, we combine various astrophysical conditions based on a steady-state model to cover the richness of the supernova ejecta in terms of entropy, expansion timescale, and electron fraction. The calculated abundances based on different combinations of conditions are compared with stellar observations with the aim of constraining supernova ejecta conditions. We find that some conditions of the neutrino-driven outflows consistently reproduce the observed abundances of our sample. In addition, from the successful combinations, the neutron-rich trajectories better reproduce the observed abundances of Sr-Zr ($Z= 38-40$), while the proton-rich ones, Mo-Pd ($Z= 42-47$).
#### The He abundance in NGC 1850 A and B: are we observing the early stage  of formation of multiple populations in a stellar cluster?

 - **Abstract**
 We present the result of a sample of B-stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud young double stellar cluster NGC 1850 A and NGC 1850 B, observed with the integral-field spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope, the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer. We compare the observed equivalent widths (EWs) of four He lines (4922 $\mathring{\mathrm A}$, 5015 $\mathring{\mathrm A}$, 6678 $\mathring{\mathrm A}$, and 7065 $\mathring{\mathrm A}$) with the ones determined from synthetic spectra computed with different He mass fraction (Y=0.25, 0.27, 0.30 and 0.35) with the code SYNSPEC, that takes into account the non-LTE effect. From this comparison, we determined the He mass fraction of the B stars, finding a not homogeneous distribution. The stars can be divided in three groups, He-weak (Y $\lt$ 0.24) and the He-normal (0.24 $\leqslant$ Y $\leqslant$ 0.26) belonging to the MS of NGC 1850 A, and the He-rich stars (0.33 $\leqslant$ Y $\leqslant$ 0.38) situated in the MS associated to NGC 1850 B. We have analyzed the stellar rotation as possible responsible of the anomalous features of the He lines in the He-rich stars. We provide a simple analysis of the differences between the observed EWs and the ones obtained from the theoretical models with different rotation velocity (V$\sin{i}$ = 0 and 250 Km/s). The resolution of the MUSE spectra do not allow to get a conclusive result, however our analysis support the He-enhanced hypothesis.
