 - **Abstract**
 Traditionally, the pair instability (PI) mass gap is located between 50\,and 130\,$M_{\odot}$, with stellar mass black holes (BHs) expected to "pile up" towards the lower PI edge. However, this lower PI boundary is based on the assumption that the star has already lost its hydrogen (H) envelope. With the announcement of an "impossibly" heavy BH of 85\,$M_{\odot}$ as part of GW\,190521 located inside the traditional PI gap, we realised that blue supergiant (BSG) progenitors with small cores but large Hydrogen envelopes at low metallicity ($Z$) could directly collapse to heavier BHs than had hitherto been assumed. The question of whether a single star can produce such a heavy BH is important, independent of gravitational wave events. Here, we systematically investigate the masses of stars inside the traditional PI gap by way of a grid of 336 detailed MESA stellar evolution models calculated across a wide parameter space, varying stellar mass, overshooting, rotation, semi-convection, and $Z$. We evolve low $Z$ stars in the range $10^{-3} < Z / Z_{\odot} < Z_{\rm SMC}$, making no prior assumption regarding the mass of an envelope, but instead employing a wind mass loss recipe to calculate it. We compute critical Carbon-Oxygen and Helium core masses to determine our lower limit to PI physics, and we provide two equations for $M_{\text{core}}$ and $M_{\text{final}}$ that can also be of use for binary population synthesis. Assuming the H envelope falls into the BH, we confirm the maximum BH mass below PI is $M_{\text{BH}} \simeq 93.3$ $M_{\odot}$. Our grid allows us to populate the traditional PI gap, and we conclude that the distribution of BHs above the gap is not solely due to the shape of the initial mass function (IMF), but also to the same stellar interior physics (i.e. mixing) that which sets the BH maximum.

 - **Abstract**
 Circumbinary disks are found in a variety of astrophysical scenarios, spanning binary star formation to accreting supermassive black hole binaries. The interaction with a circumbinary disk can yield opposite effects on the binary orbit leading to circularization, or exciting the eccentricity, widening the orbit or shrinking it and facilitating mergers. We present a new formalism for the long-term evolution of the disk-binary interaction based on the results of recent suites of hydrodynamic simulations, which resolve the complex geometry of the gas in the vicinity of the binary and fully account for the gravitational and accretion forces. We release a python package, \texttt{spindler}, that implements our model. We show that, unless the mass reservoir feeding the disk is comparable to the mass of the binary, accretion onto the binary depletes the disk mass before inducing a significant change in orbital separation or mass ratio. This finding implies that, in most scenarios, interaction with a circumbinary disk is not an efficient mechanism to shrink the orbit of the binary. However, as long as the mass of the disk is at least a few percent of the mass of the binary, the interaction can excite the eccentricity up to an equilibrium value, and induce a statistical correlation between mass ratio and eccentricity. We consider the applicability of our model to a variety of astrophysical scenarios: during star formation, in evolved stellar binaries, triples and in supermassive black hole binaries. We discuss the theoretical and observational implications of our predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 In the late stage of terrestrial planet formation, planets are predicted to undergo pairwise collisions known as giant impacts. Here we present a high-resolution database of giant impacts for differentiated colliding bodies of iron-silicate composition, with target masses ranging from 10^-4 M_Earth up to super-Earths (5 M_Earth). We vary impactor-to-target mass ratio, core-mantle (iron-silicate) fraction, impact velocity, and impact angle. Strength in the form of friction is included in all simulations. We find that due to strength, collisions with bodies smaller than about 2*10^-3 M_Earth can result in irregular shapes, compound core structures, and captured binaries. We observe that the characteristic escaping velocity of smaller remnants (debris) is approximately half of the impact velocity, significantly faster than currently assumed in N-body simulations of planet formation. Incorporating these results in N-body planet formation studies would provide more realistic debris-debris and debris-planet interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) has the largest aperture and a 19-beam L-band receiver, making it powerful for investigating the neutral hydrogen atomic gas (HI) in the universe. We present HiFAST (https://hifast.readthedocs.io), a dedicated, modular, and self-contained calibration and imaging pipeline for processing the HI data of FAST. The pipeline consists of frequency-dependent noise diode calibration, baseline fitting, standing wave removal using an FFT-based method, flux density calibration, stray radiation correction, and gridding to produce data cubes. These modules can be combined as needed to process the data from most FAST observation modes: tracking, drift scanning, On-The-Fly mapping, and most of their variants. With HiFAST, the RMS noises of the calibrated spectra from all 19 beams were only slightly (~ 5%) higher than the theoretical expectation. The results for the extended source M33 and the point sources are consistent with the results from Arecibo. The moment maps (0,1 and 2) of M33 agree well with the results from the Arecibo Galaxy Environment Survey (AGES) with a fractional difference of less than 10%. For a common sample of 221 sources with signal-to-noise ratio S/N >10 from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey, the mean value of fractional difference in the integrated flux density, $S_{\mathrm{int}}$, between the two datasets is approximately 0.005 %, with a dispersion of 15.4%. Further checks on the integrated flux density of 23 sources with seven observations indicate that the variance in the flux density of the source with luminous objects ($S_\mathrm{int}$ $ > 2.5$ Jy km s$^{-1}$) is less than 5%. Our tests suggest that the FAST telescope, with the efficient, precise, and user-friendly pipeline HiFAST, will yield numerous significant scientific findings in the investigation of the HI in the universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos can undergo fast flavor conversions (FFCs) within extremely dense astrophysical environments such as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and neutron star mergers (NSMs). In this study, we explore FFCs in a \emph{multi-energy} neutrino gas, revealing that when the FFC growth rate significantly exceeds that of the vacuum Hamiltonian, all neutrinos (regardless of energy) share a common survival probability dictated by the energy-integrated neutrino spectrum. We then employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to predict the asymptotic outcomes of FFCs within such a multi-energy neutrino gas. These predictions are based on the first two moments of neutrino angular distributions for each energy bin, typically available in state-of-the-art CCSN and NSM simulations. Our PINNs achieve errors as low as $\lesssim6\%$ and $\lesssim 18\%$ for predicting the number of neutrinos in the electron channel and the relative absolute error in the neutrino moments, respectively.
#### Molecular Bubble and Outflow in S Mon Revealed by Multiband Datasets

 - **Abstract**
 We identify a molecular bubble, and study the star formation and its feedback in the S Mon region, using multiple molecular lines, young stellar objects (YSOs), and infrared data. We revisit the distance to S Mon, ~722+/-9 pc, using Gaia Data Release 3 parallaxes of the associated Class II YSOs. The bubble may be mainly driven by a massive binary system (namely 15 Mon), the primary of which is an O7V-type star. An outflow is detected in the shell of the bubble, suggesting ongoing star formation activities in the vicinity of the bubble. The total wind energy of the massive binary star is three orders of magnitude higher than the sum of the observed turbulent energy in the molecular gas and the kinetic energy of the bubble, indicating that stellar winds help to maintain the turbulence in the S Mon region and drive the bubble. We conclude that the stellar winds of massive stars have an impact on their surrounding environment.

 - **Abstract**
 Star clusters were historically considered simple stellar populations, with all stars sharing the same age and initial chemical composition. However, the presence of chemical anomalies in globular clusters (GCs), called multiple stellar populations (MPs), has challenged star formation theories in dense environments. Literature studies show that mass, metallicity, and age are likely controlling parameters for the manifestation of MPs. Identifying the limit between clusters with/without MPs in physical parameter space is crucial to reveal the driving mechanism behind their presence. In this study, we look for MP signals in Whiting 1, traditionally considered a young GC. Using the Magellan telescope, we obtained low-resolution spectra within $\rm \lambda\lambda = 3850-5500 \r{A}$ for eight giants of Whiting 1. We measured the C and N abundances from the CN and CH spectral indices. C and N abundances have variations comparable with their measurement errors ($\sim0.1$ dex), suggesting that MPs are absent from Whiting 1. Combining these findings with literature studies, we propose a limit in the metallicity vs. cluster compactness index parameter space, which relatively clearly separates star clusters with/without MPs (GCs/open clusters). This limit is physically motivated. On a larger scale, the galactic environment determines cluster compactness and metallicity, leading to metal-rich, diffuse, old clusters formed ex situ. Our proposed limit also impacts our understanding of the formation of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy: star clusters formed after the first starburst (age$\lesssim 8-10$ Gyr). These clusters are simple stellar populations because the enriched galactic environment is no longer suitable for MP formation.
#### Origin of $^{60}$Fe nuclei in cosmic rays: the contribution of local OB  associations

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of live $^{60}$Fe nuclei (lifetime of 3.8~Myr) in cosmic rays detected by the ACE/CRIS instrument suggests a nearby nucleosynthesis source. $^{60}$Fe is primarily produced in core-collapse supernovae, and we aim to clarify whether the detected $^{60}$Fe nuclei can be associated with a particular local supernova. We consider 25 OB associations and sub-groups located within 1 kpc of the solar system based on recent $Gaia$ census. A model is developed that combines stellar population synthesis within these OB associations, cosmic-ray acceleration within associated superbubbles, and cosmic-ray transport to the solar system. The most critical model parameter impacting $^{60}$Fe cosmic-ray production is the explodability criterion, which determines if a massive star ends its life as a supernova. Our study points to the Sco-Cen OB association as the most probable origin of the observed $^{60}$Fe nuclei, particularly suggesting they were accelerated in the Sco-Cen superbubble by a young supernova aged $\leq500$ kyr with a progenitor mass of approximately $13-20~M_\odot$. A less likely source is the supernova at the origin of the Geminga pulsar 342 kyr ago, if the progenitor originated in the Orion OB1 association. The contribution of local OB associations to the cosmic-ray density of stable $^{56}$Fe is estimated to be around 20\%, with some sensitivity to cosmic ray acceleration efficiency and diffusion coefficient. These findings shed light on the origins of cosmic-ray nuclei, connecting them to nucleosynthesis events within our local cosmic neighborhood.
#### An Enduring Rapidly Moving Storm as a Guide to Saturn's Equatorial Jet's  Complex Structure

 - **Abstract**
 Saturn has an intense and broad eastward equatorial jet with a complex three-dimensional structure mixed with time variability. The equatorial region experiences strong seasonal insolation variations enhanced by ring shadowing and three of the six known giant planetary-scale storms have developed in it. These factors make Saturn's equator a natural laboratory to test models of jets in giant planets. Here we report on a bright equatorial atmospheric feature imaged in 2015 that moved steadily at a high speed of 450 ms-1 not measured since 1980-81 with other equatorial clouds moving within an ample range of velocities. Radiative transfer models show that these motions occur at three altitude levels within the upper haze and clouds. We find that the peak of the jet (latitudes 10\degree N to 10\degree S) suffers intense vertical shears reaching +2.5 ms-1 km-1, two orders of magnitude higher than meridional shears, and temporal variability above 1 bar altitude level.
#### Diagnostic potential of wavelength-integrated scattering polarisation  signals of the solar He II Ly-alpha line

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: Main goal of this work is to study the potential of He II Ly-alpha wavelength-integrated scattering polarisation for probing the magnetism of the solar upper chromosphere. Methods: Radiative transfer calculations are performed in semi-empirical 1D solar atmospheres considering a two-term atomic model and accounting for the Hanle, Zeeman, and magneto-optical effects. The problem is suitably linearised and discretised, and the resulting numerical system is solved with a matrix-free iterative method. The results obtained modelling scattering processes with three different descriptions, namely in the limit of complete frequency redistribution (CRD), and accounting for partial frequency redistribution (PRD) effects under the angle-averaged (AA) approximation and in the general angle-dependent (AD) formulation, are compared. Results: In the line-core, the synthetic Stokes profiles resulting from CRD, PRD-AA, and PRD-AD calculations show a very good agreement. On the other hand, relevant differences are observed in Q/I outside the line-core region. Besides, the precise structure of the atmospheric model does not noticeably affect the line-core profiles, but it strongly impacts the Q/I signals outside the line-core. As most of the He II Ly-alpha photons originate in the core region, it turns out that wavelength-integrated linear polarisation signals are almost insensitive to both the scattering description and the atmospheric model. Appreciable wavelength-integrated U/I signals, showing observable sensitivity to horizontal magnetic fields in the range 0-1000 G, are also found, particularly near the limb. It turns out that, while the integration time required to detect magnetic fields in the quiet chromosphere with this line is too long for sounding rocket missions, magnetic fields corresponding to typical plage areas would produce detectable signals, especially near the limb.

 - **Abstract**
 The Venus thermal radiation spectrum exhibits the signature of $CO_2$ absorption bands. By means of inversion techniques, those bands enable the retrieval of atmospheric temperature profiles. We have analyzed VIRTIS-M-IR night-side data obtaining high-resolution thermal maps of Venus south polar region between 55 and 85 km altitudes for three dynamical configurations of the vortex. The cold collar is clearly distinguishable at $\sim 62$ km altitude level, and it is more than 15 K colder than the pole on average. The South Polar Vortex appears as a vertically extended hot region close to the pole and squeezed by the cold collar between altitudes 55 and 67 km but spreading equatorward at about 74 km. Both the instantaneous temperature maps and their zonal averages show that the top altitude limit of the thermal signature of the vortex is at $\sim 80$ km altitude, at least on the night-side of the planet. The upper part of the atmosphere (67 - 85 km) is more homogeneous and has long-scale horizontal temperature differences of about 25 K over horizontal distances of $\sim 2,000$ km. The lower part (55 - 67 km) shows more fine-scale structure, creating the vortex' morphology, with thermal differences of up to about 50 K over $\sim 500$ km horizontal distances. We also study the vertical stability of different atmospheric layers within the 55 - 85 km altitude range for the three vortex configurations. It is always positive, but the cold collar is the most vertically stable structure at polar latitudes, while the vortex and sub-polar latitudes show lower stability values. Furthermore, the hot filaments present within the vortex exhibit lower stability values than their surroundings. The layer between 62 and 67 km resulted to be the most stable. These results are in good agreement with conclusions from previous radio occultation analyses.
#### The Metallicity-Electron Temperature Relationship in HII Regions

 - **Abstract**
 HII region heavy-element abundances throughout the Galactic disk provide important constraints to theories of the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. In LTE, radio recombination line (RRL) and free-free continuum emission are accurate extinction-free tracers of the HII region electron temperature. Since metals act as coolants in HII regions via the emission of collisionally excited lines, the electron temperature is a proxy for metallicity. Shaver et al. found a linear relationship between metallicity and electron temperature with little scatter. Here, we use CLOUDY HII region simulations to (1) investigate the accuracy of using RRLs to measure the electron temperature; and (2) explore the metallicity-electron temperature relationship. We model 135 HII regions with different ionizing radiation fields, densities, and metallicities. We find that electron temperatures derived under the assumption of LTE are about 20% systematically higher due to non-LTE effects, but overall LTE is a good assumption for cm-wavelength RRLs. Our CLOUDY simulations are consistent with the Shaver et al. metallicity-electron temperature relationship but there is significant scatter since earlier spectral types or higher electron densities yield higher electron temperatures. Using RRLs to derive electron temperatures assuming LTE yields errors in the predicted metallicity as large as 10%. We derive correction factors for Log(O/H) + 12 in each CLOUDY simulation. For lower metallicities the correction factor depends primarily on the spectral-type of the ionizing star and range from 0.95 to 1.10, whereas for higher metallicities the correction factor depends on the density and is between 0.97 and 1.05.
#### GODMAX: Modeling gas thermodynamics and matter distribution using JAX

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.18072
 - **Abstract**
 We introduce GODMAX (Gas thermODynamics and Matter distribution using jAX), a novel code designed to calculate correlations between the cosmological matter distribution and various gas thermodynamic quantities. Utilizing the extensive ANTILLES suite of 200 hydrodynamical simulations with a diverse range of baryonic feedback strengths, we jointly fit the 3D profiles of total matter distribution, electron density, and electron pressure across various halo masses and redshifts. By accommodating significant variations in gas profiles expected due to baryonic feedback, solving exact hydrostatic equilibrium equation and offering flexible modeling of non-thermal pressure support, GODMAX has the capability to jointly fit all these profiles within the measurement uncertainties. This advancement enables, for the first time, robust joint analyses of multiple cosmic probes, including the kinetic and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, weak lensing, and X-ray observations. Furthermore, the model accurately captures correlations between the total matter power suppression due to baryonic feedback and local average thermodynamic quantities, such as the baryon fraction and integrated tSZ effect, in high-mass halos, aligning with observations from hydrodynamical simulations. Looking ahead, we forecast the expected constraints on cosmological and baryonic parameters from upcoming weak lensing catalogs from the LSST and tSZ maps from the Simons Observatory. This analysis underscores the importance of cross-correlations between weak lensing and tSZ in enhancing parameter constraints by resolving major systematic uncertainties due to baryonic physics. The GODMAX code leverages the JAX library, resulting in a fully differentiable halo model with native GPU compilation support.
#### Strong Bow Shocks: Turbulence and An Exact Self-Similar Asymptotic

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18080
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.18080
 - **Abstract**
 We show that strong bow shocks are turbulent and non-universal near the head, but asymptote to a universal steady, self-similar, and analytically solvable flow in the downstream. The turbulence is essentially 3D, and has been confirmed by a 3D simulation. The asymptotic behavior is confirmed with high resolution 2D and 3D simulations of a cold uniform wind encountering both a solid spherical obstacle and stellar wind. This solution is relevant in the context of: (i) probing the kinematic properties of observed high-velocity compact bodies -- e.g., runaway stars and/or supernova ejecta blobs -- flying through the interstellar medium; and (ii) constraining stellar bow shock luminosities invoked by some quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) models.
