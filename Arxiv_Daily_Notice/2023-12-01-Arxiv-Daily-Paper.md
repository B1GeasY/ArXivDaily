#### Filament formation due to diffusive instabilities in dusty  protoplanetary disks

 - **Abstract**
 We report the finding of a new, local diffusion instability in a protoplanetary disk, which can operate in a dust fluid, subject to mass diffusion, shear viscosity, and dust-gas drag, provided diffusivity, viscosity, or both decrease sufficiently rapidly with increasing dust surface mass density. We devise a vertically averaged, axisymmetric hydrodynamic model to describe a dense, mid-plane dust layer in a protoplanetary disk. The gas is modeled as a passive component, imposing an effective, diffusion-dependent pressure, mass diffusivity, and viscosity onto the otherwise collisionless dust fluid, via turbulence excited by the gas alone, or dust and gas in combination. In particular, we argue that such conditions are met when the dust-gas mixture generates small-scale turbulence through the streaming instability, as supported by recent measurements of dust mass diffusion slopes in simulations. We hypothesize that the newly discovered instability may be the origin of filamentary features, almost ubiquitously found in simulations of the streaming instability. In addition, our model allows for growing oscillatory modes, which operate in a similar fashion as the axisymmetric viscous overstability in dense planetary rings. However, it remains speculative if the required conditions for such modes can be met in protoplanetary disks.
#### Echoes in the Noise: Posterior Samples of Faint Galaxy Surface  Brightness Profiles with Score-Based Likelihoods and Priors

 - **Abstract**
 Examining the detailed structure of galaxy populations provides valuable insights into their formation and evolution mechanisms. Significant barriers to such analysis are the non-trivial noise properties of real astronomical images and the point spread function (PSF) which blurs structure. Here we present a framework which combines recent advances in score-based likelihood characterization and diffusion model priors to perform a Bayesian analysis of image deconvolution. The method, when applied to minimally processed \emph{Hubble Space Telescope} (\emph{HST}) data, recovers structures which have otherwise only become visible in next-generation \emph{James Webb Space Telescope} (\emph{JWST}) imaging.
#### Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA: Spiral Accretion into  the High-mass Protostellar Core G336.01-0.82

 - **Abstract**
 We observed the high-mass star-forming core G336.01-0.82 at 1.3 mm and 0.05'' (~150 au) angular resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) as part of the Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA (DIHCA) survey. These high-resolution observations reveal two spiral streamers feeding a circumstellar disk at opposite sides in great detail. Molecular line emission from CH$_3$OH shows velocity gradients along the streamers consistent with infall. Similarly, a flattened envelope model with rotation and infall implies a mass larger than 10 M$_\odot$ for the central source and a centrifugal barrier of 300 au. The location of the centrifugal barrier is consistent with local peaks in the continuum emission. We argue that gas brought by the spiral streamers is accumulating at the centrifugal barrier, which can result in future accretion burst events. A total high infall rate of ~$4\times10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ is derived by matching models to the observed velocity gradient along the streamers. Their contribution account for 20-50% the global infall rate of the core, indicating streamers play an important role in the formation of high-mass stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Mirror Stars are a generic prediction of dissipative dark matter models, including minimal atomic dark matter and twin baryons in the Mirror Twin Higgs. Mirror Stars can capture regular matter from the interstellar medium through extremely suppressed kinetic mixing interactions between the regular and the dark photon. This accumulated "nugget" will draw heat from the mirror star core and emit highly characteristic X-ray and optical signals. In this work, we devise a general parameterization of mirror star nugget properties that is independent of the unknown details of mirror star stellar physics, and use the Cloudy spectral synthesis code to obtain realistic and comprehensive predictions for the thermal emissions from optically thin mirror star nuggets. We find that mirror star nuggets populate an extremely well-defined and narrow region of the HR diagram that only partially overlaps with the white dwarf population. Our detailed spectral predictions, which we make publicly available, allow us to demonstrate that optically thin nuggets can be clearly distinguished from white dwarf stars by their continuum spectrum shape, and from planetary nebulae and other optically thin standard sources by their highly exotic emission line ratios. Our work will enable realistic mirror star telescope searches, which may reveal the detailed nature of dark matter.
#### Comet 81P/Wild 2: A Record of the Solar System's Wild Youth

 - **Abstract**
 NASA's Stardust mission returned rocky material from the coma of comet 81P/Wild 2 (pronounced "Vilt 2") to Earth for laboratory study on January 15, 2006. Comet Wild 2 contains volatile ices and likely accreted beyond the orbit of Neptune. It was expected that the Wild 2 samples would contain abundant primordial molecular cloud material--interstellar and circumstellar grains. Instead, the interstellar component of Wild 2 was found to be very minor, and nearly all of the returned particles formed in broad and diverse regions of the solar nebula. While some characteristics of the Wild 2 material are similar to primitive chondrites, its compositional diversity testifies to a very different origin and evolution history than asteroids. Comet Wild 2 does not exist on a continuum with known asteroids. Collisional debris from asteroids is mostly absent in Wild 2, and it likely accreted dust from the outer and inner Solar System (across the putative gap created by a forming Jupiter) before dispersal of the solar nebula. Comets are a diverse set of bodies, and Wild 2 may represent a type of comet that accreted a high fraction of dust processed in the young Solar System.

 - **Abstract**
 Core segregation and atmosphere formation are two of the major processes that redistribute the volatile elements-hydrogen (H), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S)-in and around rocky planets during their formation. The volatile elements by definition accumulate in gaseous reservoirs and form atmospheres. However, under conditions of early planet formation, these elements can also behave as siderophiles (i.e., iron-loving) and become concentrated in core-forming metals. Current models of core formation suggest that metal-silicate reactions occurred over a wide pressure, temperature, and compositional space to ultimately impose the chemistries of the cores and silicate portions of rocky planets. Additionally, the solubilities of volatile elements in magmas determine their transfer between the planetary interiors and atmospheres, which has recently come into sharper focus in the context of highly irradiated, potentially molten exoplanets. Recently, there has been a significant push to experimentally investigate the metal-silicate and magma-gas exchange coefficients for volatile elements over a wide range of conditions relevant to rocky planet formation. Qualitatively, results from the metal-silicate partitioning studies suggest that cores of rocky planets could be major reservoirs of the volatile elements though significant amounts will remain in mantles. Results from solubility studies imply that under oxidizing conditions, most H and S are sequestered in the magma ocean, while most N is outgassed to the atmosphere, and C is nearly equally distributed between the atmosphere and the interior. Under reducing conditions, nearly all N dissolves in the magma ocean, the atmosphere becomes the dominant C reservoir, while H becomes more equally distributed between the interior and the atmosphere, and S remains dominantly in the interior.
#### Weighing neutrinos with Lyman-$α$ observations

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of massive neutrinos has still not been revealed by the cosmological data. We consider a novel method based on the two-point line-of-sight correlation function of high-resolution Lyman-$\alpha$ data to achieve this end in the paper. We adopt semi-analytic models of Lyman-$\alpha$ clouds for the study. We employ Fisher matrix technique to show that it is possible to achieve a scenario in which the covariance of the two-point function nearly vanishes for both the spectroscopic noise and the signal. We analyze this near 'zero noise' outcome in detail to argue it might be possible to detect neutrinos of mass range $m_\nu \simeq 0.05 \hbox{--}0.1 \, \rm eV$ with signal-to-noise of unity with a single QSO line of sight. We show that this estimate can be improved to SNR $\simeq 3\hbox{--}6$ with data along multiple line of sights within the redshift range $z \simeq 2 \hbox{--} 2.5$. Such data sets already exist in the literature. We further carry out principal component analysis of the Fisher matrix to study the degeneracies of the neutrino mass with other parameters. We show that Planck priors lift the degeneracies between the neutrino mass and other cosmological parameters. However, the prospects of the detection of neutrino mass are driven by the poorly-determined parameters characterizing the ionization and thermal state of Lyman-$\alpha$ clouds.
#### Stellar Feedback in the Star Formation-Gas Density Relation: Comparison  between Simulations and Observations

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The impact of stellar feedback on the Kennicutt-Schmidt law (KS law), which relates star formation rate (SFR) to surface gas density, is a topic of ongoing debate. The interpretation of individual cloud observations is challenging due to the various processes at play simultaneously and inherent biases. Therefore, a numerical investigation is necessary to understand the role of stellar feedback and identify observable signatures. Aims. We investigate the role of stellar feedback on the KS law, aiming to identify distinct signatures that can be observed and analysed. Methods. We analyse MHD numerical simulations of a $10^4\,M_{\odot}$ cloud evolving under different feedback prescriptions. The set of simulations contains four types of feedback: with only protostellar jets, with ionising radiation from massive stars $(>8\,M_{\odot})$, with both of them and without any stellar feedback. To compare these simulations with the existing observational results, we analyse their evolution by adopting the same techniques applied in observational studies. Then, we simulate how the same analyses would change if the data were affected by typical observational biases. Conclusions. The presence of stellar feedback strongly influences the KS relation and the star formation efficiency per free-fall time ($\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$). Its impact is primarily governed by its influence on the cloud's structure. Although the $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$ measured in our clouds results to be higher than what is usually observed in real clouds, upon applying prescriptions to mimic observational biases we recover good agreement with the expected values. Therefore, we can infer that observations tend to underestimate the total SFR. Moreover, this likely indicates that the physics included in our simulations is sufficient to reproduce the basic mechanisms contributing to set $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$.
#### Experimental study of the binding energy of NH3 on different types of  ice and its impact on the snow line of NH3 and H2O

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.18619
 - **Abstract**
 N-bearing molecules (like N2H+ or NH3) are excellent tracers of high-density, low-temperature regions like dense cloud cores and could shed light into snowlines in protoplanetary disks and the chemical evolution of comets. However, uncertainties exist about the grain surface chemistry of these molecules -- which could play an important role in their formation and evolution. This study explores experimentally the behaviour of NH$_3$ on surfaces mimicking grains under interstellar conditions alongside other major interstellar ice components (ie. H$_2$O, CO, CO$_2$). We performed co-deposition experiments using the Ultra High Vacuum (UHV) setup VENUS (VErs des NoUvelles Syntheses) of NH$_3$ along with other adsorbates (here, H$_2$O, $^{13}$CO and CO$_2$) and performed Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) and Temperature Programmed-During Exposure Desorption (TP-DED) experiments. We obtained binding Energy (BE) distribution of NH$_3$ on Crystalline Ice(CI) and compact-Amorphous Solid Water (c-ASW) by analyses of the TPD profiles of NH3 on the substrates. We observe a significant delay in the desorption and a decrease in the desorption rate of NH$_3$ when H$_2$O is introduced into the co-deposited mixture of NH$_3$-$^{13}$Co or NH$_3$-CO$_2$, absent without H$_2$O. Secondly, H$_2$O traps nearly 5-9 per cent of the co-deposited NH3, released during water's amorphous-to-crystalline phase change. Thirdly, for CI, we obtained a BE distribution between 3780K-4080K, and c-ASW between 3780K-5280K -- using a pre-exponential factor A = 1.94$\times 10^{15}$/s. We conclude that NH$_3$ behaviour is significantly influenced by the presence of H$_2$O due to the formation of hydrogen bonds, in line with quantum calculations. This interaction preserves NH$_3$ on grain surfaces to higher temperatures making it available to the central protostar in protoplanetary disks. It also explains why NH$_3$ freeze out in pre-stellar cores is efficient.
#### Scaling K2 VII: Evidence for a high occurrence rate of hot sub-Neptunes  at intermediate ages

 - **Abstract**
 The NASA K2 mission obtained high precision time-series photometry for four young clusters, including the near-twin 600-800 Myr-old Praesepe and Hyades clusters. Hot sub-Neptunes are highly prone to mass-loss mechanisms, given their proximity to the the host star and the weakly bound gaseous envelopes, and analyzing this population at young ages can provide strong constraints on planetary evolution models. Using our automated transit detection pipeline, we recover 15 planet candidates across the two clusters, including 10 previously confirmed planets. We find a hot sub-Neptune occurrence rate of 79-107% for GKM stars in the Praesepe cluster. This is 2.5-3.5 sigma higher than the occurrence rate of 16.54+1.00-0.98% for the same planets orbiting the ~3-9 Gyr-old GKM field stars observed by K2, even after accounting for the slightly super-solar metallicity ([Fe/H]~0.2 dex) of the Praesepe cluster. We examine the effect of adding ~100 targets from the Hyades cluster, and extending the planet parameter space under examination, and find similarly high occurrence rates in both cases. The high occurrence rate of young, hot sub-Neptunes could indicate either that these planets are undergoing atmospheric evolution as they age, or that planetary systems that formed when the Galaxy was much younger are substantially different than from today. Under the assumption of the atmospheric mass-loss scenario, a significantly higher occurrence rate of these planets at the intermediate ages of Praesepe and Hyades appears more consistent with the core-powered mass loss scenario sculpting the hot sub-Neptune population, compared to the photoevaporation scenario.
