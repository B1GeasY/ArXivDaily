 - **Abstract**
 We study stars in the J-regions of the asymptotic giant branch (JAGB) of near-infrared color magnitude diagrams in the maser host NGC 4258 and 4 hosts of 6 Type Ia supernovae (SN~Ia): NGC 1448, NGC 1559, NGC 5584, and NGC 5643. These clumps of stars are readily apparent near $1.0< F150W-F277W <1.5$ and $m_{F150W}$=22-25 mag with \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} NIRCam photometry. Various methods have been proposed to assign an apparent reference magnitude for this recently proposed standard candle, including the mode, median, sigma-clipped mean or a modeled parameter of its luminosity function. We test the consistency of these by measuring intra-host variations, finding differences of up to $\sim$0.2 mag that significantly exceed statistical uncertainties. Brightness differences appear intrinsic, and are further amplified by the non-uniform shape of the JAGB LF, an issue already apparent in comparing the LMC and SMC. We follow a ``many methods'' approach to consistently measure JAGB magnitudes and distances to the SN Ia host sample calibrated by NGC 4258. We find broad agreement with the distances measured from Cepheids, tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and Miras. However, the SN host mean distance estimated via the JAGB method and necessary to estimate $H_0$, differs by $\sim$ 0.18 mag amongst the above definitions, a result of the different levels of asymmetry of the JAGB luminosity functions. The methods yield a full range of $72-78$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, i.e., a fiducial result of $H_0=74.7 \pm 2.2$ (stat) $\pm$ 2.3 (sys) ($\pm$ 3.2 if combined in quadrature) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, independent of Cepheids, TRGB, or Miras, with systematic errors limited by the differences in methods. Future work may seek to further standardize and refine this promising tool, making it more competitive with established distance indicators.

 - **Abstract**
 The satellite galaxy Crater II of the Milky Way is extremely cold and exceptionally diffuse. These unusual properties are challenging to understand in the standard model of cold dark matter. We investigate the formation of Crater II in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), where dark matter particles can scatter and thermalize. We conduct a series of controlled N-body simulations to model the tidal evolution of Crater II, varying the self-interacting cross section, orbit parameters, and initial stellar distribution. Dark matter self-interactions lead to halo core formation and the distribution of stars expands accordingly. A cored SIDM halo also boosts tidal mass loss, allowing for a high orbit. Our simulations show that SIDM halos with a $1~{\rm kpc}$ core can simultaneously explain the low stellar velocity dispersion and the large half-light radius of Crater II, remaining robust to the initial distribution of stars. For the orbit motivated by the measurements from Gaia Early Data Release 3, the favored self-interacting cross section is approximately $60~{\rm cm^2/g}$ on the mass scale of Crater II.
#### GMF G214.5-1.8 as traced by CO: I -- cloud-scale CO freeze-out as a  result of a low cosmic-ray ionisation rate

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the outer Galaxy giant molecular filament (GMF) G214.5-1.8 (G214.5) using IRAM 30m data of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O. We find that the $^{12}$CO (1-0) and (2-1) derived excitation temperatures are near identical and are very low, with a median of 8.2 K, showing that the gas is extremely cold across the whole cloud. Investigating the abundance of $^{13}$CO across G214.5, we find that there is a significantly lower abundance along the entire 13 pc spine of the filament, extending out to a radius of $\sim 0.8$ pc, corresponding to $A_v \gtrsim 2$ mag and $T_{dust} \lesssim 13.5$ K. Due to this, we attribute the decrease in abundance to CO freeze-out, making G214.5 the largest scale example of freeze-out yet. We construct an axisymmetric model of G214.5's $^{13}$CO volume density considering freeze-out and find that to reproduce the observed profile significant depletion is required beginning at low volume densities, $n\gtrsim2000$ cm$^{-3}$. Freeze-out at this low number density is possible only if the cosmic-ray ionisation rate is $\sim 1.9 \times 10^{-18}$ s$^{-1}$, an order of magnitude below the typical value. Using timescale arguments, we posit that such a low ionisation rate may lead to ambipolar diffusion being an important physical process along G214.5's entire spine. We suggest that if low cosmic-ray ionisation rates are more common in the outer Galaxy, and other quiescent regions, cloud-scale CO freeze-out occurring at low column and number densities may also be more prevalent, having consequences for CO observations and their interpretation.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova remnants interacting with molecular/atomic clouds are interesting X-ray sources to study broadband nonthermal emission. X-ray line emission in these systems can be produced by different processes, e.g. low energy cosmic rays interacting with the cloud and fast ejecta fragments moving in the cloud. The paper aims at studying the origin of the non-thermal X-ray emission of the southwestern limb of SN 1006 beyond the main shock, in order to distinguish if the emission is due to low energy cosmic rays diffusing in the cloud or to ejecta knots moving into the cloud. We analyzed the X-ray emission of the southwestern limb of SN 1006, where the remnant interacts with an atomic cloud, with three different X-ray telescopes ({NuSTAR, Chandra and XMM-Newton) and performed a combined spectro-imaging analysis of this region. The analysis of the non thermal X-ray emission of the southwestern limb of SN 1006, interacting with an atomic cloud, has shown the detection of an extended X-ray source in the atomic cloud, approximately $2$ pc upstream of the shock front. The source is characterized by a hard continuum (described by a power law with photon index $\Gamma\sim1.4$) and by Ne, Si and Fe emission lines. The observed flux suggests that the origin of the X-ray emission is not associated with low energy cosmic rays interacting with the cloud. On the other hand, the spectral properties of the source, together with the detection of an IR counterpart visible with \textit{Spitzer}-MIPS at 24 $\mu$m are in good agreement with expectations for a fast ejecta fragment moving within the atomic cloud. We detected X-ray and IR emission from a possible ejecta fragment, with radius approximately 1$\times10^{17}$ cm, and mass approximately $10^{-3}M_\odot$ at about 2 pc out of the shell of SN 1006, in the interaction region between the southwestern limb of the remnant and the atomic cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 The spatial distribution of Galactic stars with different chemical abundances encodes information on the processes that drove the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. Survey selection functions are indispensable for analysing astronomical catalogues produced by large-scale surveys. The use of these selection functions in data modelling is more complex when data from different surveys are to be modelled simultaneously. We introduce a procedure for constructing the selection function of a sample of red clump stars that have parallaxes and elemental abundances from the Gaia mission. We separately constructed the selection function of the APOGEE DR17 red clump stars, which depends on very different observables and has a very different spatial coverage. We combined the two surveys and accounted for their joint selection function to provide strong constraints on the radial and vertical density distribution of mono-abundance populations, with Gaia offering a dense coverage of the solar neighbourhood, while APOGEE reaches larger distances near the Galactic plane. We confirm that the radial density profile steepens with increasing metallicity. The combined sample also indicates a metallicity-dependent flaring of the alpha-poor disc. We provide the code for constructing the Gaia selection function we used in this study through the GaiaUnlimited Python package.
#### Can the giant planets of the Solar System form via pebble accretion in a  smooth protoplanetary disc?

 - **Abstract**
 Prevailing $N$-body planet formation models typically start with lunar-mass embryos and show a general trend of rapid migration of massive planetary cores to the inner Solar System in the absence of a migration trap. This setup cannot capture the evolution from a planetesimal to embryo, which is crucial to the final architecture of the system. We aim to model planet formation with planet migration starting with planetesimals of $\sim10^{-6}$ -- $10^{-4}M_\oplus$ and reproduce the giant planets of the Solar System. We simulated a population of 1,000 -- 5,000 planetesimals in a smooth protoplanetary disc, which was evolved under the effects of their mutual gravity, pebble accretion, gas accretion, and planet migration, employing the parallelized $N$-body code SyMBAp. We find that the dynamical interactions among growing planetesimals are vigorous and can halt pebble accretion for excited bodies. While a set of results without planet migration produces one to two gas giants and one to two ice giants beyond 6 au, massive planetary cores readily move to the inner Solar System once planet migration is in effect. Dynamical heating is important in a planetesimal disc and the reduced pebble encounter time should be considered in similar models. Planet migration remains a challenge to form cold giant planets in a smooth protoplanetary disc, which suggests an alternative mechanism is required to stop them at wide orbits.

 - **Abstract**
 We observe the magnetic field morphology towards a nearby star-forming filamentary cloud, G202.3+2.5, by the JCMT/POL-2 850 {\mu}m thermal dust polarization observation with an angular resolution of 14.4" (~0.053 pc). The average magnetic field orientation is found to be perpendicular to the filaments while showing different behaviors in the four subregions, suggesting various effects from filaments' collision in these subregions. With the kinematics obtained by N2H+ observation by IRAM, we estimate the plane-of-sky (POS) magnetic field strength by two methods, the classical Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) method and the angular dispersion function (ADF) method, B_{pos,dcf} and B_{pos,adf} are ~90 {\mu}G and ~53 {\mu}G. We study the relative importance between the gravity (G), magnetic field (B) and turbulence (T) in the four subregions, find G > T > B, G >= T > B, G ~ T > B and T > G > B in the north tail, west trunk, south root and east wing, respectively. In addition, we investigate the projection effect on the DCF and ADF methods based on a similar simulation case and find the 3D magnetic field strength may be underestimated by a factor of ~3 if applying the widely-used statistical B_{pos}-to-B_{3D} factor when using DCF or ADF method, which may further underestimate/overestimate related parameters.
#### Formation of flattened planetesimals by gravitational collapse of  rotating pebble clouds

 - **Abstract**
 Planetesimals are believed to form by the gravitational collapse of aerodynamically concentrated clumps of pebbles. Many properties of the objects in the cold classical Kuiper belt -- such as binarity, rotation, and size distribution -- are in agreement with this gravitational collapse model. Further support comes from the pebble-pile structure inferred for comet nuclei. For this study, we simulated the final assembly of a planetesimal from the gravitational collapse of a rotating clump of pebbles. We implemented a numerical method from granular dynamics to follow the collapse that includes the transition from a pebble swarm to solid cells at a high density. We compared the shapes of the simulated planetesimals with the shapes of the lobes of contact binaries and bilobed Solar System objects. We find that the gravitational collapse of slowly rotating pebble clouds naturally explains the formation of flattened ellipsoidal bodies. This result agrees well with the flattened structure of the bilobed planetesimal Arrokoth and the shapes of the components of bilobed comets.

 - **Abstract**
 A recent study by Hon et al. reported that a close-in planet around the red clump star, 8 UMi, should have been engulfed during the expansion phase of the stellar evolution. They explained the survival of this exoplanet through a binary merger channel for 8 UMi. The key to testing this formation scenario is to derive the true age of this star: an old "imposter" resulting from a binary merger or a genuinely young red clump giant? To accomplish this, we derive kinematic and chemical properties for 8 UMi using astrometric data from $Gaia$ DR3 and the element-abundance pattern measured from a high-resolution ($R \sim 75,000$) spectrum taken by SOPHIE. Our analysis shows that 8 UMi is a normal thin-disk star with orbital rotation speed of $\it{V}_\mathrm{\phi}=\mathrm{244.96 km s^{-1}}$, and possesses a Solar metallicity ([Fe/H] $= -0.01 \pm 0.07$) and $\alpha$-element abundance ratio ([$\alpha$/Fe] $= 0.00 \pm 0.03$). By adopting well-established relationships between age and space velocities/elemental abundances, we estimate a kinematic age of $3.50^{+3.00}_{-2.00}$ Gyr, and a chemical age of $2.75^{+1.50}_{-1.00}$ Gyr from [C/N] and $3.47 \pm 1.96$ Gyr from [Y/Mg] for 8 UMi, respectively. These estimates are consistent with the isochrone-fitting age ($1.85^{+0.55}_{-0.30}$ Gyr) of 8 UMi, but are all much younger than 8.6 Gyr required in a binary merger scenario. This result challenges the binary merger model; the existence of such a closely orbiting exoplanet around a giant star remains a mystery yet to be resolved.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars condition the evolution of the interstellar medium by the amount of energy released during their lives and especially by their deaths as supernova explosions. The vast amounts of spectroscopic data for massive stars provided by previous and existing instruments on ground-based and space-based telescopes have already saturated our capability to process them by the use of human routines. As a consequence, there is a pressing need for machine-assisted tools to help handle incoming data. To this end, we present the development of a massive star spectroscopic multiwavelength interactive database designed for scientific research and a fully automatic stellar parameter determination tool. Here we show the preliminary results of the application of these tools to optical spectra of O-type stars.
#### JWST-TST High Contrast: Asymmetries, dust populations and hints of a  collision in the $β$ Pictoris disk with NIRCam and MIRI

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first JWST MIRI and NIRCam observations of the prominent debris disk around Beta Pictoris. Coronagraphic observations in 8 filters spanning from 1.8 to 23~$\mu$m provide an unprecedentedly clear view of the disk at these wavelengths. The objectives of the observing program were to investigate the dust composition and distribution, and to investigate the presence of planets in the system. In this paper, we focus on the disk components, providing surface brightness measurements for all images and a detailed investigation of the asymmetries observed. A companion paper by Kammerer et al. will focus on the planets in this system using the same data. We report for the first time the presence of an extended secondary disk in thermal emission, with a curved extension bent away from the plane of the disk. This feature, which we refer to as the ``cat's tail", seems to be connected with the previously reported CO clump, mid-infrared asymmetry detected in the southwest side, and the warp observed in scattered light. We present a model of this secondary disk sporadically producing dust that broadly reproduces the morphology, flux, and color of the cat's tail, as well as other features observed in the disk, and suggests the secondary disk is composed largely of porous, organic refractory dust grains.
#### Spatio-temporal map of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds using  Gaia: Synchronized peaks and radial shrinkage of cluster formation

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed view of cluster formation (CF) to trace the evolution and interaction history of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) in the last 3.5 Gyr. Using the \textit{Gaia} DR3 data, we parameterized 1710 and 280 star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), where 847 and 113 clusters are newly characterized in the outer LMC and SMC, respectively. We estimated the age-extinction-metallicity-distance parameters using an automated fitting of the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) after field star removal, followed by an MCMC technique. We report a first-time detection of two synchronized CF peaks in the MCs at 1.5$\pm$0.12 Gyr and 800$\pm$60 Myr. We recommend that the choice of the metallicity ($Z$) values of isochrones for clusters with age $\le$ 1 - 2 Gyr are Z$_{\text{LMC}}$ = 0.004 - 0.008 and Z$_{\text{SMC}}$ = 0.0016 - 0.004 for the LMC and SMC, respectively. We found evidence for spiral arms in the LMC, as traced by the cluster count profiles over the last 3.5 Gyr. The density maps provide evidence of ram-pressure stripping in the North-East of the LMC, a severe truncation of CF in the South of the LMC, and a radial shrinkage of CF in the SMC in the last 450 Myr. The last SMC-LMC interaction ($\sim$ 150 Myr) resulted in a substantial CF in the North and Eastern SMC, with a marginal impact on the LMC. This study provides important insights into the CF episodes in the MCs and their connection to the LMC-SMC-MW interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 The relative importance of magnetic fields, turbulence, and gravity in the early phases of star formation is still not well understood. We report the first high-resolution dust polarization observations at 850 $\mu$m around the most massive clump, located at the hub of the Giant Molecular Cloud G148.24+00.41, using SCUBA-2/POL-2 at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. We find that the degree of polarization decreases steadily towards the denser portion of the cloud. Comparing the intensity gradients and local gravity with the magnetic field orientations, we find that local gravity plays a dominant role in driving the gas collapse as the magnetic field orientations and gravity vectors seem to point towards the dense clumps. We also find evidence of U-shaped magnetic field morphology towards a small-scale elongated structure associated with the central clump, hinting at converging accretion flows towards the clump. Our observation has resolved the massive clump into multiple substructures. We study the magnetic field properties of two regions, central clump (CC) and northeastern elongated structure (NES). Using the modified Davis-Chandrasekhar Fermi method, we determine that the magnetic field strengths of CC and NES are $\sim$24.0 $\pm$ 6.0 $\mu$G and 20.0 $\pm$ 5.0 $\mu$G, respectively. The mass-to-flux ratios are found to be magnetically transcritical/supercritical, while the Alfv$\acute{\text{e}}$n Mach number indicates a trans-Alfv$\acute{\text{e}}$nic state in both regions. These results, along with Virial analysis, suggest that at the hub of G148.24+00.41, gravitational energy has an edge over magnetic and kinetic energies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the second data release (DR2) of the Far-Infrared Polarimetric Large-Area CMZ Exploration (FIREPLACE) survey. This survey utilized the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) High-resolution Airborne Wideband Camera plus (HAWC+) instrument at 214 $\mu$m (E-band) to observe dust polarization throughout the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way. DR2 consists of observations that were obtained in 2022 covering the region of the CMZ extending roughly from the Brick to the Sgr C molecular clouds (corresponding to a roughly 1$^{\circ}$ $\times$ 0.75$^{\circ}$ region of the sky). We combine DR2 with the first FIREPLACE data release covering the Sgr B2 region to obtain full coverage of the CMZ (a 1.5$^{\circ}$ $\times$0.75$^{\circ}$ region of the sky). After applying total and polarized intensity significance cuts on the full FIREPLACE data set we obtain $\rm\sim$65,000 Nyquist-sampled polarization pseudovectors. The distribution of polarization pseudovectors confirms a bimodal distribution in the CMZ magnetic field orientations, recovering field components that are oriented predominantly parallel or perpendicular to the Galactic plane. These magnetic field orientations indicate possible connections between the previously observed parallel and perpendicular distributions. We also inspect the magnetic fields toward a set of prominent CMZ molecular clouds (the Brick, Three Little Pigs, 50 km s$\rm^{-1}$, Circum-nuclear Disk, CO 0.02-0.02, 20 km s$\rm^{-1}$, and Sgr C), revealing spatially varying magnetic fields that generally trace the morphologies of the clouds. We find evidence that compression from stellar winds and shear from tidal forces are prominent mechanisms influencing the structure of the magnetic fields observed within the clouds.
