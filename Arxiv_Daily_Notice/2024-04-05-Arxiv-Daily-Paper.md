 - **Abstract**
 In the cold dark matter paradigm, our Galaxy is predicted to contain >10000 dark matter subhaloes in the $10^5-10^8M_\odot$ range which should be completely devoid of stars. Stellar streams are sensitive to the presence of these subhaloes, which can create small-scale features in streams if they pass closely enough. Modelling these encounters can therefore, potentially recover the subhalo's properties. In this work, we demonstrate this for streams generated in numerical simulations, modelled on eccentric orbits in a realistic Milky Way potential, which includes the Large Magellanic Cloud and the subhalo itself. We focus on a mock model of the ATLAS-Aliqa Uma stream and inject a $10^7 M_\odot$ subhalo, creating a similar discontinuous morphology to current observations. We then explore how well subhalo properties are recovered using mock stream observations, consisting of no observational errors, as well as assuming realistic observational setups. These setups include present day style observations, and what will be possible with 4MOST and Gaia DR5 in the future. We show that we can recover all parameters describing the impact even with uncertainties matching existing data, including subhalo positions, velocities, mass and scale radius. Modelling the subhalo on an orbit instead of assuming an impulse approximation, we greatly reduce the degeneracy between subhalo mass and velocity seen in previous works. However, we find a slight bias in the subhalo mass (~0.1 dex). This demonstrates that we should be able to reliably extract the properties of subhaloes with stellar streams in the near future.

 - **Abstract**
 Flux ropes erupting from the vicinity of the black hole are thought to be a potential model for the flares observed in Sgr\,A$^*$. In this study, we examine the radiative properties of flux ropes that emerged from the vicinity of the black hole. We have performed three-dimensional two-temperature General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of magnetized accretion flows with alternating multiple magnetic loops, and General Relativistic Radiation Transfer (GRRT) calculations. In GRMHD simulations, two different sizes of initial magnetic loops are implemented. In the small loop case, magnetic dissipation leads to a weaker excitement of magneto-rotational instability inside the torus which generates a lower accretion rate compared to the large loop case. However, it makes more generation of flux ropes due to frequent reconnection by magnetic loops with different polarities. By calculating the thermal synchrotron emission, we found that the variability of light curves and emitting region are tightly related. At $230\,\rm GHz$ and higher frequency, the emission from the flux ropes is relatively stronger compared with the background, which is responsible for the filamentary structure in the images. At lower frequencies, e.g. $43\,\rm GHz$, emission comes from more extended regions, which have a less filamentary structure in the image. Our study shows self-consistent electron temperature models are essential for the calculation of thermal synchrotron radiation and the morphology of the GRRT images. Flux ropes contribute considerable emission at frequencies $\gtrsim 230\,\rm GHz$.
#### MusE GAs FLOw and Wind (MEGAFLOW) XI. Scaling relations between outflows  and host galaxy properties

 - **Abstract**
 Absorption line spectroscopy using background quasars can provide strong constraints on galactic outflows. In this paper, we investigate possible scaling relations between outflow properties, namely outflow velocity \Vout, the mass ejection rate $\dot M_{\rm out}$, and the mass loading factor $\eta$ and the host galaxy properties, such as star formation rate (SFR), SFR surface density, redshift, and stellar mass using galactic outflows probed by background quasars from MEGAFLOW and other surveys. We find that $V_{\rm out}$ ($\eta$) is (anti-)correlated with SFR and SFR surface density. We extend the formalism of momentum-driven outflows of Heckman et al. to show that it applies not only to down the barrel studies but also to winds probed by background quasars, suggesting a possible universal wind formalism. Under this formalism, we find a clear distinction between ``strong'' and ``weak'' outflows where ``strong'' outflows seem to have tighter correlations with galaxy properties (SFR or galaxy stellar mass) than ``weak'' outflows.
#### The Impact-driven Atmospheric Loss of Super-Earths around Different  Spectral Type Host Stars

 - **Abstract**
 The planet's mass loss is important for the planet's formation and evolution. The radius valley (RV) is believed to be triggered by evaporation-induced mass loss. As an alternative mechanism for the RV, the mass loss of post-impact planets is thoroughly investigated in this work. The impact energy is converted to the planet's internal energy, enhancing its core energy and accelerating mass loss and orbital migration. As the host star changes from K-type to F-type, the planet's mass loss and orbital migration increase. When the initial gas-to-core mass ratio (GCR) is small, the migration efficiency for planets around K-type stars will increase, which helps to suppress mass loss and retain the planet's mass and radius within a specific range. On the contrary, planets around more massive F-type stars experience more substantial mass loss, potentially leading to complete mass loss, and migrate to orbits with longer periods. Our calculation shows that planets around different spectral types of host stars give rise to an RV ranging from 1.3-2.0 $R_{\oplus}$, consistent with the observed range of 1.3-2.6 $R_{\oplus}$. Despite the presence of uncertain parameters, the planetesimal impact can promote the RV establishment for planets around host stars of different spectral types.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detection in the interstellar medium of $N$-cyanomethanimine (H$_2$CNCN), the stable dimer of HCN of highest energy, and the most complex organic molecule identified in space containing the prebiotically relevant NCN backbone. We have identified a plethora of $a$-type rotational transitions with 3 $\leq J_\text{up} \leq$ 11 and $K_\text{a} \leq$ 2 that belong to this species towards the Galactic Center G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud, the only interstellar source showing the three cyanomethanimine isomers (including the $Z$- and $E$- isomers of $C$-cyanomethanimine, HNCHCN). We have derived a total column density for H$_2$CNCN of (2.9$\, \pm \,$0.1)$\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, which translates into a total molecular abundance with respect to H$_2$ of (2.1$\, \pm \,$0.3)$\times$10$^{-11}$. We have also revisited the previous detection of $E$- and $Z$-HNCHCN, and found a total $C/N$-cyanomethanimine abundance ratio of 31.8$\, \pm \,$1.8 and a $Z/E$-HNCHCN ratio of 4.5$\, \pm \,$0.2. While the latter can be explained on the basis of thermodynamic equilibrium, chemical kinetics are more likely responsible for the observed $C/N$-cyanomethanimine abundance ratio, where the gas-phase reaction between methanimine (CH$_2$NH) and the cyanogen radical (CN) arises as the primary formation route.
#### Exploring Universe acceleration through observational constraints via  Hubble parameter reconstruction

 - **Abstract**
 In this article, we introduce an innovative parametric representation of the Hubble parameter, providing a model-independent means to explore the dynamics of an accelerating cosmos. The model's parameters are rigorously constrained through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, leveraging a comprehensive dataset consisting of 31 data points from cosmic chronometers (CC), 1701 updated observations of Pantheon supernovae type Ia (SNeIa), and 6 data points from baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO). Our analysis delves into the behavior of various cosmological parameters within the model, including the transition from a decelerating phase to an accelerating one, as well as the density parameters and the equation of state (EoS) parameter. The outcomes of our investigation reveal that the equation of state parameter aligns with characteristics reminiscent of the phantom model, supporting the prevailing understanding of our universe's current state of acceleration. This research contributes valuable insights into the ongoing cosmic expansion and underscores the utility of our novel parametric approach.
