#### Variation of the high-mass slope of the stellar initial mass function:  Theory meets observations

 - **Abstract**
 We present observational evidence of the correlation between the high-mass slope of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in young star clusters and their stellar surface density, $\sigma_{*}$. When the high-mass end of the IMF is described by a power law of the form $dN/d{\rm log}{M_{*}}\propto M_{*}^{-\Gamma}$, the value of $\Gamma$ is seen to weakly decrease with increasing $\sigma_{*}$, following a $\Gamma=1.31~\sigma_{*}^{-0.095}$ relation. We also present a model that can explain these observations. The model is based on the idea that the coalescence of protostellar cores in a protocluster forming clump is more efficient in high density environments where cores are more closely packed. The efficiency of the coalescence process is calculated as a function of the parental clump properties and in particular the relation between its mass and radius as well as its core formation efficiency. The main result of this model is that the increased efficiency of the coalescence process leads to shallower slopes of the IMF in agreement with the observations of young clusters, and the observations are best reproduced with compact protocluster forming clumps. These results have significant implications for the shape of the IMF in different Galactic and extragalactic environments and have very important consequences for galactic evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent work on the characterization of small exoplanets has allowed us to accumulate growing evidence that the sub-Neptunes with radii greater than $\sim2.5\,R_\oplus$ often host H$_2$/He-dominated atmospheres both from measurements of their low bulk densities and direct detections of their low mean-molecular-mass atmospheres. However, the smaller sub-Neptunes in the 1.5-2.2 R$_\oplus$ size regime are much less understood, and often have bulk densities that can be explained either by the H$_2$/He-rich scenario, or by a volatile-dominated composition known as the "water world" scenario. Here, we report the detection of water vapor in the transmission spectrum of the $1.96\pm0.08$ R$_\oplus$ sub-Neptune GJ9827d obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. We observed 11 HST/WFC3 transits of GJ9827d and find an absorption feature at 1.4$\mu$m in its transit spectrum, which is best explained (at 3.39$\sigma$) by the presence of water in GJ9827d's atmosphere. We further show that this feature cannot be caused by unnoculted star spots during the transits by combining an analysis of the K2 photometry and transit light-source effect retrievals. We reveal that the water absorption feature can be similarly well explained by a small amount of water vapor in a cloudy H$_2$/He atmosphere, or by a water vapor envelope on GJ9827d. Given that recent studies have inferred an important mass-loss rate ($>0.5\,$M$_\oplus$/Gyr) for GJ9827d making it unlikely to retain a H-dominated envelope, our findings highlight GJ9827d as a promising water world candidate that could host a volatile-dominated atmosphere. This water detection also makes GJ9827d the smallest exoplanet with an atmospheric molecular detection to date.

 - **Abstract**
 An intriguing pattern among exoplanets is the lack of detected planets between approximately $1.5$ R$_\oplus$ and $2.0$ R$_\oplus$. One proposed explanation for this "radius gap" is the photoevaporation of planetary atmospheres, a theory that can be tested by studying individual planetary systems. Kepler-105 is an ideal system for such testing due to the ordering and sizes of its planets. Kepler-105 is a sun-like star that hosts two planets straddling the radius gap in a rare architecture with the larger planet closer to the host star ($R_b = 2.53\pm0.07$ R$_\oplus$, $P_b = 5.41$ days, $R_c = 1.44\pm0.04$ R$_\oplus$, $P_c = 7.13$ days). If photoevaporation sculpted the atmospheres of these planets, then Kepler-105b would need to be much more massive than Kepler-105c to retain its atmosphere, given its closer proximity to the host star. To test this hypothesis, we simultaneously analyzed radial velocities (RVs) and transit timing variations (TTVs) of the Kepler-105 system, measuring disparate masses of $M_b = 10.8\pm2.3$ M$_\oplus$ ($ \rho_b = 0.97\pm0.22$ g cm$^{-3}$) and $M_c = 5.6\pm1.2$ M$_\oplus $ ($\rho_c = 2.64\pm0.61$ g cm$^{-3}$). Based on these masses, the difference in gas envelope content of the Kepler-105 planets could be entirely due to photoevaporation (in 76\% of scenarios), although other mechanisms like core-powered mass loss could have played a role for some planet albedos.
