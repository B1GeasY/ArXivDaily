 - **Abstract**
 Our goal is to estimate the total gas mass in the direction of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), quantify the various uncertainties associated, and discuss the implications for the estimates of CR energy densities and dust opacities. The $H_{\rm{I}}$ 21 cm line and the carbon monoxide isotopes ($^{12}\rm{CO}$, $^{13}\rm{CO}$ and $\rm{C}^{18}\rm{O}$) line emission maps are used to derive the total gas column density. The gas in the CMZ is separated from the disk contribution in position and velocity thanks to its different properties in term of velocity dispersion and brightness ratio of CO isotopes. The variations of the $X_{\rm{CO}}$ factors are modelled relying on both theoretical trends from simulations and empirical corrections. We use the new gas column density estimated together with gamma-ray and dust emission measurements to derive the CR energy density and dust opacities, respectively. The $X_{\rm{CO}}$ values in the CMZ range from $(0.32 - 1.37) \ \times$ $10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ km$^{-1}$ s, with a distribution that is highly asymmetric and skewed. The median value is $ \rm{\overline{X}_{CO}^{CMZ}} = 0.39 \ \times$ $10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ km$^{-1}$ s. The total gas mass in the CMZ is estimated to be $2.3_{-0.3}^{+0.3}\times10^{7} \; \rm{M_{\odot}}$ with $\sim 10 \%$ contribution from the atomic phase. Without removing the disk contamination the total mass is about twice higher, and the atomic gas fraction increases to $\sim30\%$. The cosmic-ray (CR) energy density in the CMZ, assuming a 1/r profile, is higher by a factor of two compared to the previous calculations at TeV energies. Using molecular gas tracers which probes only the densest molecular cores leads to an overestimation of the CR energy density, while ignoring the foreground/background contribution leads to an underestimation of the CR energy density in the CMZ.

 - **Abstract**
 Areas of massive star formation are strongly influenced by stellar winds and supernovae, therefore, enhanced turbulent flows are expected. We analyse high-quality Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations of the neutral hydrogen gas content of DDO 43, a relatively nearby irregular dwarf galaxy. The line wings of neutral hydrogen spectral lines, which provide insights into local enhanced velocity dispersion, are investigated together with far-ultraviolet data, tracing emissions from massive star-forming regions. We find very weak correlations with both higher and lower velocity areas.

 - **Abstract**
 We report two anti-reflection (AR) coatings that give better quantum efficiency (QE) than the existing AR coating on the Gaia astrometric field (AF) CCDs. Light being the core of optical astronomy is extremely important for such missions, therefore, the QE of the devices that are used to capture it should be substantially high. To reduce the losses due to the reflection of light from the surface of the CCDs, AR coatings can be applied. Currently, the main component of the Gaia satellite, the AF CCDs use hafnium dioxide (HfO2) AR coating. In this paper, the ATLAS module of the SILVACO software has been employed for simulating and studying the AF CCD pixel structure and several AR coatings. Our findings evidently suggest that zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) and tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) will prove to be better AR coatings for broadband astronomical CCDs in the future and will open new avenues for understanding the evolution of the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Near (~100 pc) and far (~8.7 kpc) relative to the Galactic center, the molecular clouds SgrB2(N) and Orion-KL exhibit different values of the fundamental physical constant mu=m_e/m_p - the electron-to-proton mass ratio. Measured frequency difference between the emission lines of methanol (CH3OH), - J_K_u - J_K_l = 6_3 - 5_2 A+ 542000.981 MHz, 6_3 - 5_2 A- 542081.936 MHz, and 8_0 - 7_-1 E 543076.194 MHz, - observed with the space observatory Herschel toward SgrB2(N) and Orion-KL corresponds to (Sgr-Ori): Delta mu/mu = (-3.7 +/- 0.5)*10^(-7) (1 sigma C.L.). At the same time, comparison of the same methanol lines in Orion-KL with laboratory frequencies shows no significant changes in mu (Ori-lab): Delta mu/mu = (-0.5 +/- 0. 6)*10^(-7), while a comparison between SgrB2(N) and laboratory lines indicates a lower value of mu near the Galactic center (Sgr-lab): Delta mu/mu = (-4.2 +/- 0.7)*10^(-7). The reduced value of mu in SgrB2(N) is not explained by known systematic effects and requires further investigation.

 - **Abstract**
 The long-term evolution of relativistic jets in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), particularly from days to months post-burst, remains a fundamental puzzle in astrophysics. Here, we report our very long baseline interferometry observation of the brightest GRB 221009A from 5 to 26 days post-burst. Combined with released data, we uncover a remarkable two-stage evolution of the jet lateral size. The jet size initially grew slowly but later expanded rapidly, challenging conventional scenarios. The slow-evolving stage provides a robust lower limit on the jet opening angle and direct evidence of jet propagation in the uniform interstellar medium at this period. The synergy analysis of the whole jet size evolution and multi-wavelength emissions uncovers that GRB 221009A harbors an ultra-narrow jet (with a half-opening angle $\simeq$ 0.01-0.03~radian) that propagates through a wind-like medium before encountering the interstellar medium, which finally undergoes lateral spreading after significant deceleration. These findings provide crucial new insights into relativistic jet dynamics and establish GRB 221009A as a unique case study for understanding the complex physics of GRB outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 Mass changes due to strong stellar winds and binary mass transfer have a dramatic impact on the consequent evolution of stars. This is generally not accounted for in population synthesis codes which are built using single star evolution models from full stellar evolution codes. We produce a new grid of models using the 1D stellar evolution code \textit{MESA} which includes models with a range of core mass fractions, at each total stellar mass, evolved from core hydrogen exhaustion to the onset of core helium burning. The model grid is used to produce an interpolation table, designed for use in population synthesis codes such as \textit{binary\_c}. We test the interpolation table with a simple integration algorithm to evaluate its capability of reproducing accurate evolutionary tracks. We test our method for stellar masses in the range $M=1-16~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and show that it successfully reproduces the Hertzpsrung-gap and giant branch lifetime, the core mass at helium ignition and the HR diagram.

 - **Abstract**
 There has been growing evidence that mu and tau neutrinos are noticeably different due to the emergence of muons in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs). Recent theoretical studies also suggest that all flavors of neutrinos and antineutrinos inevitably experience some flavor mixing instabilities including fast neutrino flavor conversions (FFC), which corresponds to one of the collective neutrino oscillations powered by neutrino self-interactions. This represents a need for quantum kinetic treatment in the numerical modeling of neutrino dynamics, which is, however, a formidable computational challenge. In this paper, we present an approximate method to predict asymptotic states of FFC without solving a quantum kinetic equation under a three-flavor framework, in which mu and tau neutrino distributions are not necessarily identical to each other. The approximate method is developed based on a Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) relaxation time prescription, capable of capturing essential features of mixing competitions among three different flavor-coherent states. Our proposed scheme is computationally inexpensive and easy to implement in any classical neutrino transport scheme.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-metallicity stars preserve the signatures of the first stellar nucleosynthesis events in the Galaxy, as their surface abundances reflect the composition of the interstellar medium from which they were born. Aside from primordial Big Bang nucleosynthesis, massive stars, due to their short lifetimes, dominate the ejecta into the interstellar medium of the early Galaxy. Most of them will end as core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions, and typical ejected abundance distributions, e.g. in terms of the alpha-element-to-Fe ratios, reflect these contributions. Essentially all CCSNe contribute 56Fe. Therefore, low-metallicity stars can be used to test whether the abundances of any other elements are correlated with those of Fe, i.e. whether these elements have been co-produced in the progenitor sources or if they require either a different or additional astrophysical origin(s). The present analysis focuses on stars with [Fe/H]<-2, as they probe the earliest formation phase of the Galaxy when only one or very few nucleosynthesis events had contributed their ejecta to the gas from which the lowest metallicity stars form. This was also the era before low and intermediate mass stars (or type Ia supernovae) could contribute any additional heavy elements. Following earlier works into the origin of heavy r-process elements [1], we extend the present study to examine Pearson and Spearman correlations of Fe with Li, Be, C, N, Na, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, Zn, Ge, Se, Sr, Zr, Ba, Ce, Sm, Eu, Yb, Lu, Hf, Os, Ir, Pb, Th, and U, using high-resolution stellar abundance data from the SAGA [2] and JINA [3] databases. The main goal is to identify which of the observed elements (i) may have been co-produced with Fe in (possibly a variety of) CCSNe, and which elements require (ii) either a completely different, or (iii) at least an additional astrophysical origin.
#### Making sense of the spectral line profiles of Betelgeuse and other Red SuperGiants

 - **Abstract**
 Spectropolarimetry of atomic lines in the spectra of Betelgeuse, and other Red SuperGiants (RSG), presents broad line profiles in linear polarization, but narrow profiles in intensity. Recent observations of the Red SuperGiant RW Cep show, on the other hand, broad intensity profiles, comparable to those in linear polarization. This observation hints that this difference in the Stokes Q/U and I profile widths noted in many RSG is just a temporary situation of the atmosphere of a given star. We propose an explanation for both cases based on the presence of strong velocity gradients larger than the thermal broadening of the spectral line. Using analytical but very simple radiative transfer we can compute intensity line profiles in such scenarios. We find that they qualitatively match the observed broadenings: large gradients are required for the narrow profiles of Betelgeuse, small gradients for the broad profiles of RW Cep. Profile bisectors are also reasonably well explained by this scenario in spite of the simple radiative transfer treatment. These results give a comprehensive explanation of both intensity and polarisation profiles. They provide also comfort to the approximationof a single-scattering event used in explaining the observed linear polarization in the inference of images of the photosphere of Betelgeuse and other Red SuperGiants as RW Cep, $\mu$ Cep and CE Tau. The atmospheres of Red SuperGiants appear to be able, perhaps cyclically, to either produce large velocity gradients that prevent photospheric plasma from reaching the upper atmosphere and that must hinder large events of mass loss, either to leave vertical movements unchanged, letting plasma raising, escaping gravity and forming large dust clouds in the circumstellar environement. The origin of the velocity gradient and its modulation within the atmosphere remains an open question.

 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs are failed stars with very low mass (13 to 75 $M_J$), and an effective temperature lower than 2500 K. Thus, they play a key role in understanding the gap in the mass function between stars and planets. However, due to their faint nature, previous searches are inevitably limited to the solar neighbourhood (20 pc). To improve our knowledge of the low mass part of the initial stellar mass function and the star formation history of the Milky Way, it is crucial to find more distant brown dwarfs. Using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) COSMOS-Web data, this study seeks to enhance our comprehension of the physical characteristics of brown dwarfs situated at a distance of kpc scale. The exceptional sensitivity of the JWST enables the detection of brown dwarfs that are up to 100 times more distant than those discovered in the earlier all-sky infrared surveys. The large area coverage of the JWST COSMOS-Web survey allows us to find more distant brown dwarfs than earlier JWST studies with smaller area coverages. To capture prominent water absorption features around 2.7 $\mu$m, we apply two colour criteria, F115W-F277W+1<F277W-F444W and F277W-F444W>0.9. We then select point sources by CLASS_STAR, FLUX_RADIUS, and SPREAD_MODEL criteria. Faint sources are visually checked to exclude possibly extended sources. We conduct SED fitting and MCMC simulations to determine their physical properties and associated uncertainties. Our search reveals 25 T-dwarf and 2 Y-dwarf candidates, more than any previous JWST brown dwarf searches. They are located from 0.3 kpc to 4 kpc away from the Earth. The cumulative number count of our brown dwarf candidates is consistent with the prediction from a standard double exponential model. Three of our brown dwarf candidates were detected by HST, with transverse velocities $12\pm5$ km s$^{-1}$, $12\pm4$ km s$^{-1}$, and $17\pm6$ km s$^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 For monitoring the night sky conditions, wide-angle all-sky cameras are used in most astronomical observatories to monitor the sky cloudiness. In this manuscript, we apply a deep-learning approach for automating the identification of precipitation clouds in all-sky camera data as a cloud warning system. We construct our original training and test sets using the all-sky camera image archive of the Iranian National Observatory (INO). The training and test set images are labeled manually based on their potential rainfall and their distribution in the sky. We train our model on a set of roughly 2445 images taken by the INO all-sky camera through the deep learning method based on the EfficientNet network. Our model reaches an average accuracy of 99\% in determining the cloud rainfall's potential and an accuracy of 96\% for cloud coverage. To enable a comprehensive comparison and evaluate the performance of alternative architectures for the task, we additionally trained three models LeNet, DeiT, and AlexNet. This approach can be used for early warning of incoming dangerous clouds toward telescopes and harnesses the power of deep learning to automatically analyze vast amounts of all-sky camera data and accurately identify precipitation clouds formations. Our trained model can be deployed for real-time analysis, enabling the rapid identification of potential threats, and offering a scaleable solution that can improve our ability to safeguard telescopes and instruments in observatories. This is important now that numerous small and medium-sized telescopes are increasingly integrated with smart control systems to reduce manual operation.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-mass stellar and substellar companions are indispensable objects for verifying evolutionary models that transition from low-mass stars to planets. Their formation is likely also affected by the surrounding stellar environment. The Fornax-Horologium (FH) association is a recently classified young association in the solar neighbourhood with a dissolving open cluster in its centre. It has not been searched widely for substellar companions and exoplanets with direct imaging. We search for companions of stars in the FH and investigate the formation and evolution of companions during the expansion and dissolution of a star cluster. We conduct a direct-imaging survey of 49 stars in FH with VLT/SPHERE. We present HD 24121B, a companion at the hydrogen-burning limit that orbits star HD 24121 in the core cluster of the FH. The companion is located at a projected angular separation of 2.082 $\pm$ 0.004 arcsec from the central star and has contrasts of $\Delta$H2 = 5.07 $\pm$ 0.05 mag and $\Delta$H3= 4.98 $\pm$ 0.05 mag. We estimate a photometric mass of 74.9 $\pm$ 7.5 $M_J$ for HD 24121B, which places it at the boundary of brown dwarfs and low-mass stars. It is a new benchmark object for evolutionary models at the hydrogen-burning boundary, especially at the age of 30 - 40 Myr. Orbital fitting with joint Gaia and SPHERE relative astrometry found a high eccentricity for HD 24121B. This suggests that it may have undergone dynamic scattering. Future chemical composition measurements such as high-resolution spectroscopic observations will provide more clues on its formation history.
#### Systematic bias in dark siren statistical methods and its impact on Hubble constant measurement

 - **Abstract**
 The advent of the multimessenger cosmology marked by the detection of GW170817, gravitational waves from compact objects at cosmological distances demonstrated Standard Sirens as a relevant cosmological probe. In the absence of an electromagnetic counterpart identification, GWs carry valuable information through the dark siren approach, where the source redshift is estimated using galaxy catalogs of potential hosts within the localization volume. However, the dark siren analysis can be affected by galaxy catalog incompleteness at the limits of gravitational-wave detectability, potentially introducing biases in the constraints on cosmological parameters. Focusing on GWs from binary black holes detected by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration, we explore the possible systematic biases in the measurement of the Hubble constant. These biases may arise from 1) the incompleteness of catalogs due to the apparent magnitude thresholds of optical telescope sensitivity, and 2) the use of incorrect weighting schemes (using star formation or stellar mass as tracers of the host galaxy) for each potential host. We found that an unbiased estimate of $H_0$ can be obtained when the corrected weighting scheme is applied to a complete or volume-limited catalog. The results using stellar mass as a tracer indicate that a percent-level measurement of $H_0$, with a precision of approximately 3%, can be achieved with 100 binary black hole detections by the LVK at O4 and O5 sensitivity. The O5 run provides a slight improvement, reducing the $H_0$ uncertainty by 0.07 km/s/Mpc compared to the O4-like configuration. This precision is achievable by using a complete galaxy catalog that covers the 90% of the localisation probability for each GW detection, with A$_{90\%}$<10 deg$^2$. The $H_0$ precision increases to approximately 6% when it is assumed that every galaxy has an equal probability of being the host.
