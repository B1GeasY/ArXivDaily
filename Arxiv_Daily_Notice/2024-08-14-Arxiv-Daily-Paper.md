 - **Abstract**
 We present a population-level analysis of the dayside thermal emission spectra of 19 planets observed with Hubble WFC3 and Spitzer IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 microns, spanning equilibrium temperatures 1200-2700 K and 0.7-10.5 Jupiter masses. We use grids of planet-specific 1D, cloud-free, radiative-convective-thermochemical equilibrium models (1D-RCTE) combined with a Bayesian inference framework to estimate atmospheric metallicity, the carbon-to-oxygen ratio, and day-to-night heat redistribution. In general, we find that the secondary eclipse data cannot reject the physics encapsulated within the 1D-RCTE assumption parameterized with these three variables. We find a large degree of scatter in atmospheric metallicities, with no apparent trend, and carbon-to-oxygen ratios that are mainly consistent with solar or subsolar values but do not exhibit population agreement. Together, these indicate either (1) formation pathways vary over the hot and ultra-hot Jupiter population and/or (2) more accurate composition measurements are needed to identify trends. We also find a broad scatter in derived dayside temperatures that do not demonstrate a trend with equilibrium temperature. Like with composition estimates, this suggests either significant variability in climate drivers over the population and/or more precise dayside temperature measurements are needed to identify a trend. We anticipate that 1D-RCTE models will continue to provide valuable insights into the nature of exoplanet atmospheres in the era of JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 Electromagnetic follow-up observations of gravitational wave events offer critical insights and provide significant scientific gain from this new class of astrophysical transients. Accurate identification of gravitational wave candidates and rapid release of sky localization information are crucial for the success of these electromagnetic follow-up observations. However, searches for gravitational wave candidates in real time suffer a non-negligible false alarm rate. By leveraging the sky localization information and other metadata associated with gravitational wave candidates, GWSkyNet, a machine learning classifier developed by Cabero et al. (2020), demonstrated promising accuracy for the identification of the origin of event candidates. We improve the performance of the classifier for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's fourth observing run by reviewing and updating the architecture and features used as inputs by the algorithm. We also retrain and fine-tune the classifier with data from the third observing run. To improve the prospect of electromagnetic follow-up observations, we incorporate GWSkyNet into LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's low-latency infrastructure as an automatic pipeline for the evaluation of gravitational wave alerts in real time. We test the readiness of the algorithm on a LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA mock data challenge campaign. The results show that by thresholding on the GWSkyNet score, noise masquerading as astrophysical sources can be rejected efficiently and the majority of true astrophysical signals correctly identified.

 - **Abstract**
 Filament eruptions and coronal mass ejections are physical phenomena related to magnetic flux ropes carrying electric current. A magnetic flux rope is a key structure for solar eruptions, and when it carries a southward magnetic field component when propagating to the Earth. It is the primary driver of strong geomagnetic storms. As a result, developing a numerical model capable of capturing the entire progression of a flux rope, from its inception to its eruptive phase, is crucial for forecasting adverse space weather. The existence of such flux ropes is revealed by the presence of sigmoids in active regions or hot channels by observations from space and ground instruments. After proposing cartoons in 2D, potential, linear, non-linear-force-free-field (NLFFF) and non-force-free-field (NFFF) magnetic extrapolations, 3D numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation models were developed, first in a static configuration and later dynamic data-driven MHD models using high resolution observed vector magnetograms. This paper reviews a few recent developments in data-driven mode, such as the time-dependent magneto-frictional (TMF) and thermodynamic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. Hereafter, to demonstrate the capacity of these models to reveal the physics of observations, we present the results for three events explored in our group: 1. the eruptive X1.0 flare on 28 October 2021; 2. the filament eruption on 18 August 2022; and 3. the confined X2.2 flare on 6 September 2017. These case studies validate the ability of data-driven models to retrieve observations, including the formation and eruption of flux ropes, 3D magnetic reconnection, CME three-part structures and the failed eruption. Based on these results, we provide some arguments for the formation mechanisms of flux ropes, the physical nature of the CME leading front, and the constraints of failed eruptions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-frequency polarimetric study for the quasar 1604+159. The source was observed at the $L$ band with the American Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and the $L$, $X$, and $U$ bands with the Very Large Array (VLA). These observations provide different resolutions from mas to arcsec, enabling us to probe the morphology and magnetic field from tens of parsec to hundreds of kilo-parsec scale. We detect a symmetrical Fanaroff-Riley-Class-I-like structure. The source has several lobes and bulges, forming a cocoon shape. The polarization is normal to the edges of the structure with high fractional polarization up to $\sim 60\%$. Two hotspots are observed at the eastern and western sides of the source, located symmetrically relative to the core. The flux density ratio ($>1.5$) between the two hotspots suggests the Doppler beaming effect exists at a large scale. The polarized emission in the hotspots also shows a symmetrical structure with an oblique direction from the jet direction. In general, the jet propagates in a collimating structure with several bends. Polarization is also detected perpendicular to the local jet from $\sim$100 mas to $\sim$ 1 arcsec. The jet shows strong polarized intensity and high fractional polarization at the bending edges. We discuss the possible origins of the observed structure and magnetic field.
#### ASASSN-21js: A multi-year transit of a ringed disc

 - **Abstract**
 The early-type star ASASSN-21js started to fade in 2021, as was detected by the All Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, undergoing a multi-year eclipse that is still underway. We interpret this event as being due to a structured disc of material transiting in front of the star. The disc is in orbit around a substellar object with the mass and luminosity of a brown dwarf or smaller. We want to determine the expected duration and ending date of the eclipse. We modelled a tilted and inclined azimuthally symmetric ring system around an unseen companion and calculated the resulting time-varying light curve as the object transited in front of the star. We made an initial estimate of the ring parameters and used these as inputs to an MCMC algorithm to determine the geometric properties of the rings with associated uncertainties. The model most consistent with the light curve to date is a two-ring system at high inclination with respect to the line of sight that has a semi-major axis of 71.6 stellar radii. With an estimate of the stellar radius, the transverse velocity is around 0.7 km/s, which if bound to the star is an orbit with a semi-major axis of around 13000 au, placing it in the Oort cloud of the parent star. The transit is ongoing and will finish around MJD 61526 (May 1 2027). We encourage the community to continue observing this object in order to understand its properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive star-forming regions (MSFRs) are commonly associated with hub-filament systems (HFSs) and sites of cloud-cloud collision (CCC). Recent observational studies of some MSFRs suggest a possible connection between CCC and the formation of HFSs. To understand this connection, we analyzed the magneto-hydrodynamic simulation data from Inoue et al. (2018). This simulation involves the collision of a spherical turbulent molecular cloud with a plane-parallel sea of dense molecular gas at a relative velocity of about 10 km/s. Following the collision, the turbulent and non-uniform cloud undergoes shock compression, rapidly developing filamentary structures within the compressed layer. We found that CCC can lead to the formation of HFSs, which is a combined effect of turbulence, shock compression, magnetic field, and gravity. The collision between the cloud components shapes the filaments into a cone and drives inward flows among them. These inward flows merge at the vertex of the cone, rapidly accumulating high-density gas, which can lead to the formation of massive star(s). The cone acts as a mass-collecting machine, involving a non-gravitational early process of filament formation, followed by gravitational gas attraction to finalize the HFS. The gas distribution in the position-velocity (PV) and position-position spaces highlights the challenges in detecting two cloud components and confirming their complementary distribution if the colliding clouds have a large size difference. However, such CCC events can be confirmed by the PV diagrams presenting gas flow toward the vertex of the cone, which hosts gravitationally collapsing high-density objects, and by the magnetic field morphology curved toward the direction of the collision.
#### Identification and distance measurement of dust clouds at high latitude by a clustering hierarchical algorithm

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalog of dust clouds at high Galactic latitude based on the Planck 857 GHz dust emission data. Using a clustering hierarchical algorithm, 315 dust cloud at high Galactic latitudes are identified. Additionally, using the optical and ultraviolet extinction of 4 million and 1 million stars, respectively, provided by Sun et al., we derive the distances and physical properties for 190 high Galactic latitude dust clouds and the ultraviolet excess ratios for 165 of them. Through the study of color excess ratios, this work confirms that molecular clouds with large Galactic distances and low extinction likely have a higher proportion of small-sized dust grains. In addition, clouds with well-defined distances in the catalog are used to trace the local bubble, showing good consistency with the boundary of the local bubble from the literature.
