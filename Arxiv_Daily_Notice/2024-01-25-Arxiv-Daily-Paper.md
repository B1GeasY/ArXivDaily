 - **Abstract**
 Hot Jupiters are among the best-studied exoplanets, but it is still poorly understood how their chemical composition and cloud properties vary with longitude. Theoretical models predict that clouds may condense on the nightside and that molecular abundances can be driven out of equilibrium by zonal winds. Here we report a phase-resolved emission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b measured from 5-12 $\mu$m with JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). The spectra reveal a large day-night temperature contrast (with average brightness temperatures of 1524$\pm$35 and 863$\pm$23 Kelvin, respectively) and evidence for water absorption at all orbital phases. Comparisons with three-dimensional atmospheric models show that both the phase curve shape and emission spectra strongly suggest the presence of nightside clouds which become optically thick to thermal emission at pressures greater than ~100 mbar. The dayside is consistent with a cloudless atmosphere above the mid-infrared photosphere. Contrary to expectations from equilibrium chemistry but consistent with disequilibrium kinetics models, methane is not detected on the nightside (2$\sigma$ upper limit of 1-6 parts per million, depending on model assumptions).

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae are candidate sites for the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process). We explore the effects of enrichment from $r$-process nuclei on the light-curves of hydrogen-rich supernovae (SNe IIP) and assess the detectability of these signatures. We modify the radiation transport code $\texttt{SNEC}$ to include the approximate effects of opacity and radioactive heating from $r$-process elements in the SN ejecta. We present models spanning a range of total $r$-process masses $M_{\rm r}$ and their assumed radial distribution within the ejecta, finding that $M_{\rm r} \gtrsim 10^{-2} M_\odot$ is sufficient to induce appreciable differences in their light-curves as compared to ordinary SNe IIP (without any $r$-process elements). The primary photometric signatures of $r$-process enrichment include a shortening of the plateau phase, coinciding with the hydrogen-recombination photosphere retreating to the $r$-process-enriched layers, and a steeper post-plateau decline associated with a reddening of the SN colors. We compare our $r$-process-enriched models to ordinary IIP models and observational data, showing that yields of $M_{\rm r} \gtrsim 10^{-2} M_\odot$ are potentially detectable across several of the metrics used by transient observers, provided that the $r$-process rich layers are mixed $\gtrsim$ halfway to the ejecta surface. This detectability threshold can roughly be reproduced analytically using a two-zone ("kilonova within a supernova") picture. Assuming that a small fraction of SNe produce a detectable $r$-process yield $M_{\rm r} \gtrsim 10^{-2}M_\odot$, and respecting constraints on the total Galactic production rate, we estimate that $\gtrsim 10^{3}-10^4$ SNe need be observed to find one $r$-enriched event, a feat that may become possible with the Vera Rubin Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 The detailed design and operation of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's EBIT are described for the first time, including recent design upgrades that have led to improved system stability and greater user control, increasing the scope of possible experiments. Measurements of emission from highly charged Ar were taken to determine the spatial distribution of the ion cloud and electron beam. An optical setup consisting of two lenses, a narrow band filter, and a CCD camera was used to image visible light, while an X-ray pinhole and CCD camera were used to image X-rays. Measurements were used to estimate an effective electron density of 1.77 x 10$^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Additionally, observations of X-ray emission from background EBIT gases were measured with a Silicon Lithium detector. Measurements indicate the presence of Ba and Si, which are both easily removed by dumping the trap every 2 s or less.
#### An Extremely Young Protostellar Core, MMS 1/ OMC-3: Episodic Mass  Ejection History Traced by the Micro SiO Jet

 - **Abstract**
 We present ${\sim}0.2$ arcsec ($\sim$80 au) resolution observations of the CO (2-1) and SiO (5-4) lines made with the Atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array toward an extremely young intermediate-mass protostellar source (t$_{\rm dyn}<$1000 years), MMS 1 located in the Orion Molecular Cloud-3 region. We have successfully imaged a very compact CO molecular outflow associated with MMS 1, having deprojected lobe sizes of $\sim$18000 au (red-shifted lobe) and $\sim$35000 au (blue-shifted lobe). We have also detected an extremely compact ($\lesssim$1000 au) and collimated SiO protostellar jet within the CO outflow. The maximum deprojected jet speed is measured to be as high as 93 km s$^{-1}$. The SiO jet wiggles and displays a chain of knots. Our detection of the molecular outflow and jet is the first direct evidence that MMS 1 already hosts a protostar. The position-velocity diagram obtained from the SiO emission shows two distinct structures: (i) bow-shocks associated with the tips of the outflow, and (ii) a collimated jet, showing the jet velocities linearly increasing with the distance from the driving source. Comparisons between the observations and numerical simulations quantitatively share similarities such as multiple-mass ejection events within the jet and Hubble-like flow associated with each mass ejection event. Finally, while there is a weak flux decline seen in the 850 $\mu$m light curve obtained with JCMT/SCUBA 2 toward MMS 1, no dramatic flux change events are detected. This suggests that there has not been a clear burst event within the last 8 years.

 - **Abstract**
 Although red clump stars function as reliable standard candles, their surface characteristics (i.e. T$_{\text{eff}}$, log~$g$, and [Fe/H]) overlap with those of red giant branch stars, which are not standard candles. Recent results have revealed that spectral features containing carbon (e.g. CN molecular bands) carry information correlating with the ''gold-standard'' asteroseismic classifiers that distinguish red clump from red giant branch stars. However, the underlying astrophysical processes driving the correlation between these spectroscopic and asteroseismic quantities in red giants remain inadequately explored. This study aims to enhance our understanding of this ''spectro-seismic'' effect, by refining the list of key spectral features predicting red giant evolutionary state. In addition, we conduct further investigation into those key spectral features to probe the astrophysical processes driving this connection. We employ the data-driven The Cannon algorithm to analyse high-resolution ($R\sim80,000$) Veloce spectra from the Anglo-Australian Telescope for 301 red giant stars (where asteroseismic classifications from the TESS mission are known for 123 of the stars). The results highlight molecular spectroscopic features, particularly those containing carbon (e.g. CN), as the primary indicators of the evolutionary states of red giant stars. Furthermore, by investigating CN isotopic pairs (that is, $^{12}$C$^{14}$N and $^{13}$C$^{14}$N) we find statistically significant differences in the reduced equivalent widths of such lines, suggesting that physical processes that change the surface abundances and isotopic ratios in red giant stars, such as deep mixing, are the driving forces of the ''spectro-seismic'' connection of red giants.
#### Moist Convective Storms on Saturn

 - **Abstract**
 Convective storms (CS) on Saturn appear as bright clouds, irregular in shape and rapidly changing over time, accompanied by lightning phenomena. They cover a wide range of size scales, from 500 km or less and up to sizes that encircle the planet. In this chapter we focus on medium or synoptic-scale events (typical sizes 2,000 - 7,000 km) and planetary-scale major storms known as Great White Spots (GWS). In general, the storms emerge in westward jets and in the peak of the strong eastward equatorial jet. They have been observed preferentially in the northern hemisphere and seem to occur in the same latitude in intervals of 30 and 60 years coinciding with the times of maximum insolation within the seasonal cycle. Moist convection models locate the origin of the storms in the water clouds (at about 10 bars of pressure) and to some extent in ammonia clouds, and their thermodynamics explain the possible periodicity of the phenomena. Once triggered, the storms grow and expand, and their interaction with the zonal wind system gives rise to anticyclonic ovals and to disturbances that propagate zonally covering an entire latitude band in the case of the GWS.
#### Two high-amplitude $δ$ Scuti-$γ$ Doradus hybrids constrained  by the radial fundamental p and equally spaced g modes

 - **Abstract**
 Based on 2-minute cadence TESS data, we investigate pulsations of TIC 65138566 and TIC 139729335 and discover them to be two new HADS stars with equally spaced g modes. We recognize the radial fundamental mode $f_1$ = 18.3334 c/d and the first overtone $f_3$ = 23.6429 c/d for TIC 65138566, and identify the highest peak $f_1$ = 19.0955 c/d as the radial fundamental mode for TIC 139729335. For g modes, both stars display a regular period spacing of 2413 s. Through detailed seismological analysis, we deduce that these period spacing patterns correspond to modes with $\ell$ = 1. Moreover, our analysis reveals that with the increase in masses and metallicities, the star should display a higher degree of evolution to match a specific period spacing $\Pi_0$. Conversely, the star should have a lower extent of evolution to match the radial fundamental mode. These two contradictory behaviors allow us to precisely obtain stellar physical parameters. TIC 65138566 and TIC 139729335 are determined to be two main sequence stars that have almost the same range of masses and metallicities, with $M$ = 1.36 $\pm$ 0.06 $M_{\odot}$ and $Z$ = 0.005 $\pm$ 0.002. The hydrogen abundance in the core of TIC 65138566 is estimated to be about 0.28, while TIC 139729335 has a slightly higher value of around 0.31. Finally, we suggest that the HADS $\delta$ Scuti-$\gamma$ Doradus star TIC 308396022 is a main sequence star with $M$ = 1.54 $\pm$ 0.08 $M_{\odot}$, $Z$ = 0.007 $\pm$ 0.001, and $X_{\rm c}$ = 0.18 $\pm$ 0.02.
#### candl: Cosmic Microwave Background Analysis with a Differentiable  Likelihood

 - **Abstract**
 We present candl, an automatically differentiable python likelihood for analysing Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectrum measurements. candl is powered by JAX, which makes it fast and easy to calculate derivatives of the likelihood. This facilitates, for example, robust Fisher matrices without finite-difference methods. We show the benefits of candl through a series of example calculations, covering forecasting, robustness tests, and gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. These also include optimising the band power bin width to minimise parameter errors of a realistic mock data set. Moreover, we calculate the correlation of parameter constraints from correlated and partially overlapping subsets of the SPT-3G 2018 $TT/TE/EE$ data release. In a traditional analysis framework, these tasks are slow and require careful fine-tuning to obtain stable results. As such, a fully differentiable pipeline allows for a higher level of scrutiny; we argue that this is the paradigm shift required to leverage incoming data from ground-based experiments, which will significantly improve the cosmological parameter constraints from the Planck mission. candl comes with the latest primary and lensing power spectrum data from the South Pole Telescope and Atacama Cosmology Telescope collaborations and will be used as part of the upcoming SPT-3G $TT/TE/EE$ and $\phi\phi$ data releases. Along with the core code, we release a series of auxiliary tools, which simplify common analysis tasks and interface the likelihood with other cosmological software. candl is pip-installable and publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/Lbalkenhol/candl .
#### Towards the IR Detection of Carbonic Acid: Absorption and Emission  Spectra

 - **Abstract**
 With the recent radioastronomical detection of cis-trans-carbonic acid (H$_2$CO$_3$) in a molecular cloud toward the galactic center, the more stable but currently unobserved cis-cis conformer is shown here to have strong IR features. While the higher-energy cis-trans-carbonic acid was detected at millimeter and centimeter wavelengths, owing to its larger dipole moment, the vibrational structure of cis-cis-carbonic acid is more amenable to its observation at micron wavelengths. Even so, both conformers have relatively large IR intensities, and some of these fall in regions not dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Water features may inhibit observation near the 2.75 $\mu$m hydride stretches, but other vibrational fundamentals and even overtones in the 5.5 $\mu$m to 6.0 $\mu$m range may be discernible with JWST data. This work has employed high-level, accurately benchmarked quantum chemical anharmonic procedures to compute exceptionally accurate rotational spectroscopic data compared to experiment. Such performance implies that the IR absorption and even cascade emission spectral features computed in this work should be accurate and will provide the needed reference for observation of either carbonic acid conformer in various astronomical environments.
