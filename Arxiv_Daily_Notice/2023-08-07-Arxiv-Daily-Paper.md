 - **Abstract**
 Using $N$-body simulations, we demonstrate that satellite dwarf galaxy pairs which undergo significant mixing ($\sim 6$ Gyr) can have their respective most bound particles separated great distances upon subsequently merging with a more massive host. This may provide an explanation as to the origin of the complex globular cluster NGC 2149, which is found within the tail of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy, yet separated from its central remnant by over 100 kpc. Dynamical investigations could support the chemical evidence which already points to the NGC 2419 being a nuclear star cluster. Motivated by the distinct nature of NGC 2419, we run a suite of simulations whereby an initial pre-infall merger of two satellites is followed by a post-infall merger of the remnant into a MW-like host potential. We present a striking example from our suite in this work, in which this separation is reproduced by the most bound particles of the two pre-infall satellites. Additionally, this double merger scenario can induce unusual on-sky features in the tidal debris of the post-infall merger, such as clouds, overdensities, and potentially new arms that could resemble the bifurcation observed in Sagittarius.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Potentially hazardous asteroids (PHA) in Earth-crossing orbits pose a constant threat to life on Earth. Several mitigation methods have been proposed, and the most feasible technique appears to be the disintegration of the impactor and the generation of a fragment cloud by explosive penetrators at interception. Mitigation analyses, however neglect the effect of orbital dynamics on fragments trajectory. Aims: We aim at studying the effect of orbital dynamics of the impactor's cloud on the number of fragments that hit the Earth assuming different interception dates. The effect of self-gravitational cohesion and the axial rotation of the impactor are also investigated. Methods: The orbits of 10^5 fragments are computed with a high-precision direct N-body integrator of the 8th order, running on GPUs. We consider orbital perturbations from all large bodies in the Solar System and the self-gravity of the cloud fragments. Results: Using a series of numerical experiments, we show that orbital shear causes the fragment cloud to adopt the shape of a triaxial ellipsoid. The shape and alignment of the triaxial ellipsoid are strongly modulated by the cloud's orbital trajectory, and hence the impact cross-section of the cloud with respect to the Earth. Therefore, the number of fragments hitting the Earth is strongly influenced by the orbit of the impactor and the time of interception. A minimum number of impacts occurs for a well-defined orientation of the impactor rotational axis, depending on the date of interception. Conclusions: To minimise the lethal consequences of an PHA's impact, a well-constrained interception timing is necessary. Too early interception may not be ideal for PHAs in the Apollo or Aten groups. The best time to intercept PHA is when it is at the pericentre of its orbit.
#### Ultracool Dwarfs Observed with the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph:  Equatorial Latitudes in L Dwarf Atmospheres are Cloudier

 - **Abstract**
 We report direct observational evidence for a latitudinal dependence of dust cloud opacity in ultracool dwarfs, indicating that equatorial latitudes are cloudier than polar latitudes. These results are based on a strong positive correlation between the viewing geometry and the mid-infrared silicate absorption strength in mid-L dwarfs using mid-infrared spectra from the Spitzer Space Telescope and spin axis inclination measurements from available information in the literature. We confirmed that the infrared color anomalies of L dwarfs positively correlate with dust cloud opacity and viewing geometry, where redder objects are inclined equator-on and exhibit more opaque dust clouds while dwarfs viewed at higher latitudes and with more transparent clouds are bluer. These results show the relevance of viewing geometry to explain the appearance of brown dwarfs and provide insight into the spectral diversity observed in substellar and planetary atmospheres. We also find a hint that dust clouds at similar latitudes may have higher opacity in low-surface gravity dwarfs than in higher-gravity objects.
#### The Ultraviolet to Mid-infrared Extinction Law of the Taurus Molecular  Cloud Based on the Gaia DR3, GALEX, APASS, Pan-STARRS1, 2MASS, and WISE  Surveys

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02156
 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar dust extinction law is essential for interpreting observations. In this work, we investigate the ultraviolet (UV)--mid-infrared (IR) extinction law of the Taurus molecular cloud and its possible variations. We select 504,988 dwarf stars (4200 K < Teff < 8000 K) and 4,757 giant stars (4200 K < Teff < 5200 K) based on the stellar parameters of Gaia DR3 as tracers. We establish the Teff--intrinsic color relations and determine the intrinsic color indices and color excesses for different types of stars. In the determination of color excess ratios (CERs), we analyze and correct the curvature of CERs and derive the UV--mid-IR CERs of 16 bands. We consider different effective wavelengths for different types of stars when converting CERs to relative extinction, and obtain the extinction law with a better wavelength resolution. In addition, we analyze the possible regional variation of extinction law and derive the average extinction law of Rv=3.13+-0.32 for the Taurus molecular cloud. Only 0.9% of subregions have deviations >3sigma, indicating limited regional variation in the extinction law. We also discuss the effect of Gaia Teff overestimation on the determination of the Taurus extinction law and find that the effect is negligible.
#### Surface Diffusion of Carbon Atoms as a Driver of Interstellar Organic  Chemistry

 - **Abstract**
 Many interstellar complex organic molecules (COMs) are believed to be produced on the surfaces of icy grains at low temperatures. Atomic carbon is considered responsible for the skeletal evolution processes, such as C-C bond formation, via insertion or addition reactions. Before reactions, C atoms must diffuse on the surface to encounter reaction partners; therefore, information on their diffusion process is critically important for evaluating the role of C atoms in the formation of COMs. In situ detection of C atoms on ice was achieved by a combination of photostimulated desorption and resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization methods. We found that C atoms weakly bound to the ice surface diffused approximately above 30 K and produced C2 molecules. The activation energy for C-atom surface diffusion was experimentally determined to be 88 meV (1,020 K), indicating that the diffusive reaction of C atoms is activated at approximately 22 K on interstellar ice. The facile diffusion of C at T > 22 K atoms on interstellar ice opens a previously overlooked chemical regime where the increase in complexity of COMs as driven by C atoms. Carbon addition chemistry can be an alternative source of chemical complexity in translucent clouds and protoplanetary disks with crucial implications in our current understanding on the origin and evolution of organic chemistry in our Universe.
#### Open superclusters I: The most populated primordial groups of open  clusters in the third quadrant of the Galactic disc
 - **Authors:** Juan Casado, Yasser Hendy

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02279
 - **Abstract**
 An open supercluster (OSC) is defined as a cluster of at least six open clusters (OCs) born from the same giant molecular cloud (GMC). We survey the recent catalogs of OCs based on Gaia data and relevant literature to find 17 OSCs of the third galactic quadrant, along with 190 likely members of them. OSCs are frequent enough to be considered an extra class of objects in the hierarchy of star formation. Some of these supersystems are new and most of them contain more members than previously thought. The detailed study of some OSCs has leaded to the discovery of four new young clusters that are members of them, named Casado-Hendy 2 to 5. In certain instances, subgroups with distinct PMs or 3D positions have been found within an OSC, suggesting the presence of multiple generations of stars formed from several bursts of star formation within the same GMC. OSCs are typically unbound and tend to disintegrate on timescales of 0.1 Gyr. The present results support the Primordial Group hypothesis (Casado 2022) and suggest that globular clusters are not formed from the accretion of open superclusters, at least in the local Universe at late times.
