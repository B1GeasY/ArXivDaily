 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical compact objects, viz., white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes, are the remnants of stellar deaths at the end of their life cycles. They are ideal testbeds for various fundamental physical processes under extreme conditions that are unique in nature. Observational radio astronomy with uGMRT and OORT facilities has led to several important breakthroughs in studies of different kinds of pulsars and their emission mechanisms. On the other hand, accretion processes around compact objects are at the core of Indian astronomy research. In this context, AstroSat mission revolutionized spectro-temporal observations and measurements of accretion phenomena, quasi-periodic oscillations, and jet behaviour in binary systems hosting compact objects. Moreover, recently launched XPoSat mission is set to provide an impetus to these high-energy phenomena around compact objects by enabling us to conduct polarization measurements in the X-ray band. Further, during the past decade, numerous gravitational wave signals have been observed from coalescing black holes and neutron stars in binary systems. Recent simultaneous observation of the GW170817 event in both gravitational waves and electromagnetic channels has ushered in the era of multi-messenger astronomy. In the future, synergistic efforts among several world-class observational facilities, e.g., LIGO-India, SKA, TMT, etc., within the Indian astrophysics community will provide a significant boost to achieve several key science goals that have been delineated here. In general, this article plans to highlight scientific projects being pursued across Indian institutions in this field, the scientific challenges that this community would be focusing on, and the opportunities in the coming decade. Finally, we have also mentioned the required resources, both in the form of infrastructural and human resources.
#### Magnetic dynamos powered by white dwarf superficial convection

 - **Abstract**
 When the effective temperature of a cooling white dwarf $T_{\rm eff}$ drops below the ionization limit, it develops a surface convection zone that may generate a magnetic field $B$ through the dynamo mechanism. We revisit the surface dynamo theory systematically using detailed stellar evolution computations, as well as a simple analytical model that tracks the expansion of the convection zone. The magnetic field reaches a maximum of several kG (for a hydrogen atmosphere) shortly after a convection zone is established at a cooling time $t=t_{\rm conv}$. The field then declines as $B\propto T_{\rm eff}\propto t^{-7/20}$ until the convective envelope couples to the degenerate core at $t=t_{\rm coup}$. We compare the onset of convection $t_{\rm conv}\propto M^{25/21}$ to the crystallization of the white dwarf's core $t_{\rm cryst}\propto M^{-5/3}$, and find that in the mass range $0.5\,{\rm M}_\odot<M<0.9\,{\rm M}_\odot$ the order of events is $t_{\rm conv}<t_{\rm cryst}<t_{\rm coup}$. Specifically, surface dynamos are active for a period $\Delta t\approx t_{\rm cryst}-t_{\rm conv}$ of about a Gyr (shorter for higher masses), before the convection zone is overrun by a stronger magnetic field emanating from the crystallizing core. Our predicted magnetic fields are at the current detection limit, and we do not find any observed candidates that fit the theory. None the less, surface dynamos may be an inevitable outcome of white dwarf cooling, significantly affecting white dwarf accretion and seismology.

 - **Abstract**
 Analysis of ion-kinetic instabilities in solar wind plasmas is crucial for understanding energetics and dynamics throughout the heliosphere, as evident from spacecraft observations of complex ion velocity distribution functions (VDFs) and ubiquitous ion-scale kinetic waves. In this work, we explore machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) classification models to identify unstable cases of ion VDFs driving kinetic waves. Using 34 hybrid particle-in-cell simulations of kinetic protons and $\alpha$-particles initialized using plasma parameters derived from solar wind observations, we prepare a dataset of nearly 1600 VDFs representing stable/unstable cases and associated plasma and wave properties. We compare feature-based classifiers applied to VDF moments, such as Support Vector Machine and Random Forest, with DL convolutional neural networks (CNN) applied directly to VDFs as images in the gyrotropic velocity plane. The best-performing classifier, Random Forest, has an accuracy of $0.96\pm0.01$, and a true skill score of $0.89\pm0.03$, with the majority of missed predictions made near stability thresholds. We study how the variations of the temporal derivative thresholds of anisotropies and magnetic energies and sampling strategies for simulation runs affect classification. CNN-based models have the highest accuracy of $0.88\pm0.18$ among all considered if evaluated on the runs entirely not used during the model training. The addition of the $E_{\perp}$ power spectrum as an input for the ML models leads to the improvement of instability analysis for some cases. The results demonstrate the potential of ML and DL for the detection of ion-scale kinetic instabilities using spacecraft observations of solar wind and magnetospheric plasmas.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the thermal and turbulence properties of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) is essential for analyzing their evolution and interactions with the surrounding medium. This study explores these characteristics across different regions of two distinct ICMEs observed at 1 AU, utilizing in-situ measurements from the Wind spacecraft. The polytropic indices, Gamma_e for electrons and Gamma_p for protons) reveal significant deviations from adiabatic expansion, suggesting sustained heating mechanisms within the ICMEs even at 1AU. The effective polytropic index (Gamma_eff) of the magnetic ejecta (ME) in both ICME1 and ICME2 is found to be near-isothermal (Gamma_eff = 0.88 and 0.76), aligning with measurements near the Sun, highlighting consistent heating across heliospheric distances. Spectral analysis at the inertial scale reveals Kolmogorov-like turbulence in the fast ICME1's ME, while the ME of the slower ICME2 exhibits less developed turbulence with a shallower spectral index (alpha_B). The turbulence analysis in the dissipation scale indicates that the ME of slower ICME2 is less affected by the ambient medium than the faster ICME2. The MEs of both ICMEs show magnetic compressibility much smaller than unity (C_B < 1), suggesting dominant Alfvenic fluctuations in the MEs. Notably, the partial variance of increments (PVI) method identifies more intermittent structures, such as current sheets and reconnection sites, in the sheath and post-ICME regions. Higher PVI values correlate with regions of increased electron and proton temperature (for the sheath region), as well as higher C_B values, highlighting their role in local energy dissipation. These results underscore the importance of ongoing heating and turbulence processes in shaping the evolution of ICMEs.

 - **Abstract**
 Planetary nebulae (PNe) are pivotal for advancing our knowledge of stellar evolution and galactic chemical enrichment. Recent progress in surveys and data analysis has revolutionized PN research, leading to the discovery of new objects and deeper insights into their properties. We have devised a novel photometric selection method, integrating GAIA and Pan-STARRS photometry, to identify compact PN candidates. This approach utilizes color-color diagrams, specifically (G-g) versus (GBP-GRP) and (G-r) versus (GBP-GRP), as primary criteria for candidate selection. The subsequent verification step involves confirming these candidates through LAMOST spectroscopic data. By cross-referencing a comprehensive dataset of PNe, GAIA, Pan-STARRS, and LAMOST DR7 spectra, we explore the potential of our approach and the crucial role played by these surveys in PN research. The LAMOST spectra provide compelling evidence supporting our selection criteria, especially for compact PNe characterized by strong emission lines and low continuum. Applying these criteria to a catalog of emission line objects, we have selected a PN candidate. Detailed analysis of its LAMOST spectrum unveiled classical Balmer emission lines and high-ionization lines (He II, [Ar V], [Ar III], [Ne III]), characteristic of high-ionization PNe, without low-excitation lines. Using the photoionization code Cloudy, our modeling revealed parameters including an ionizing source temperature of 180x10^3 K, luminosity around 3400 Lsun, and gas abundances encompassing various elements. Comparing the PNe evolution track, the progenitor star was estimated to have a mass of 2 Msun. Our findings show strong promise for separating compact PNe from other objects and provide a robust framework for further exploration of these surveys in the context of planetary nebulae.

 - **Abstract**
 The Universe's magnetogenesis can be investigated with radio observations of cosmic filaments, where the information on the initial magnetic field seeds is expected to be preserved in time. In this work, we update the comparison between recent observational results in filaments with the predictions from recent cosmological simulations to check whether one of them is favoured. The radio probes we use are the rotation measure (RM) of filaments as a function of the redshift ($z$), stacking of synchrotron emission from filaments, and the RM radial profile away from galaxy groups. The first two probes favour the presence of a dominant primordial magnetic field component and disfavour a sole astrophysical scenario, the third probe does not yet give an unambiguous outcome. We also estimate the average field strength in filaments. Independently of the scenario and the shape of the astrophysical component RM, it is in the range 10--60 nG at $z=0$, while, when restricted to the model that gives the best match to the simulations, it gives $43\pm 7$ nG, with an astrophysical component RM rapidly decreasing with the redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 Most massive stars will interact with a binary companion during their lifetimes. These interactions can remove the hydrogen-rich envelope, producing intermediate-mass ($\sim$2-8 M$_\odot$) and helium-rich stars. These "stripped stars" are predicted to emit predominantly in the ultraviolet (UV) and can therefore be identified via a UV excess provided they are not outshone by their companion. However, despite their importance to binary evolution, supernovae, and ionizing feedback, few stripped stars have been confirmed. This is likely due to the scarcity of wide-field, high angular resolution, UV surveys of stellar populations with reliable distances and extinction estimates. To address this, we present the Stripped-Star Ultraviolet Magellanic Clouds Survey (SUMS) catalog. We use the Tractor forward modeling software to perform PSF photometry on 2,420 Swift-UVOT images of the LMC and SMC. The resulting public catalog contains 734,869 sources in three UV filters to a depth of $\sim$20 Vega mag. We perform validation tests on the photometry pipeline and highlight the catalog's broad applicability. We then identify sources with excess UV light compared to main-sequence stars and apply a series of quality cuts. From this, we identify 522 candidate stripped stars in the LMC and 298 in the SMC. We assess the potential contamination from other UV excess systems and argue the dominant uncertainty to be dust: early main-sequence stars can mimic the colors of stripped star binaries when extinction is overcorrected. This survey lays the groundwork for the first systematic census of stripped stars and opens new windows into binary evolution and massive star populations.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting anomalies in radio astronomy is challenging due to the vast amounts of data and the rarity of labeled anomalous examples. Addressing this challenge requires efficient methods capable of identifying unusual radio galaxy morphologies without relying on extensive supervision. This work introduces an innovative approach to anomaly detection based on morphological characteristics of the radio sources using trainable COSFIRE (Combination of Shifted Filter Responses) filters as an efficient alternative to complex deep learning methods. The framework integrates COSFIRE descriptors with an unsupervised Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm to identify unusual radio galaxy morphologies. Evaluations on a radio galaxy benchmark data set demonstrate strong performance, with the COSFIRE-based approach achieving a geometric mean (G-Mean) score of 79%, surpassing the 77% achieved by a computationally intensive deep learning autoencoder. By characterizing normal patterns and detecting deviations, this semi-supervised methodology overcomes the need for anomalous examples in the training set, a major limitation of traditional supervised methods. This approach shows promise for next-generation radio telescopes, where fast processing and the ability to discover unknown phenomena are crucial.
#### Cloud and Haze Parameterization in Atmospheric Retrievals: Insights from Titan's Cassini Data and JWST Observations of Hot Jupiters

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Before JWST, telescope observations were not sensitive enough to constrain the nature of clouds in exo-atmospheres. Recent observations, however, have inferred cloud signatures as well as haze-enhanced scattering slopes motivating the need for modern inversion techniques and a deeper understanding of the JWST information content. Aims: We aim to investigate the information content of JWST exoplanet spectra. We particularly focus on designing an inversion technique able to handle a wide range of cloud and hazes. Methods: We build a flexible aerosol parameterization within the TauREx framework, enabling us to conduct atmospheric retrievals of planetary atmospheres. The method is evaluated on available Cassini occultations of Titan. We then use the model to interpret the recent JWST data for the prototypical hot Jupiters HAT-P-18 b, WASP-39 b, WASP-96 b, and WASP-107 b. In parallel, we perform complementary simulations on controlled scenarios to further understand the information content of JWST data and provide parameterization guidelines. Results: Our results use free and kinetic chemistry retrievals to extract the main atmospheric properties of key JWST exoplanets, including their molecular abundances, thermal structures, and aerosol properties. In our investigations, we show the need for a wide wavelength coverage to robustly characterize clouds and hazes-which is necessary to mitigate biases arising from our lack of priors on their composition-and break degeneracies with atmospheric chemical composition. With JWST, the characterization of clouds and hazes might be difficult due to the lack of simultaneous wavelength coverage from visible to mid-infrared by a single instruments and the likely presence of temporal variability between visits (from e.g., observing conditions, instrument systematics, stellar host variability, or planetary weather).
#### Magnetothermal evolution of neutron star cores in the `weak-coupling' regime: implications of ambipolar diffusion for the quiescent X-ray luminosity of magnetars

 - **Abstract**
 The high quiescent X-ray luminosity observed in some magnetars is widely attributed to the decay and evolution of their ultra-strong magnetic fields. Several dissipation mechanisms have been proposed, each operating with different efficiencies depending on the region of the star. In this context, ambipolar diffusion, i.e., the relative motion of charged particles with respect to neutrons in the neutron star core, has been proposed as a promising candidate due to its strong dependence on magnetic field strength and its capacity to convert magnetic energy into heat. We perform axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic simulations to study the long-term magnetic evolution of a NS core composed of normal (non-Cooper paired) matter under the influence of ambipolar diffusion. The core is modeled as a two-fluid system consisting of neutrons and a charged-particle fluid (protons and electrons), coupled to the magnetic field. Simulations are performed both at constant and variable temperatures. In the latter case, a strategy that decouples the magnetic and thermal evolution is employed, enabling efficient thermal modeling across a range of initial magnetic field strengths. At constant temperature, we obtained the expected result where neutrons reach diffusive equilibrium, the Lorentz force is balanced by chemical potential gradients of charged particles, and the magnetic field satisfies a non-linear Grad-Shafranov equation. When thermal evolution is included, fields $B \gtrsim 5 \times 10^{15} \,\text{G}$ can balance ambipolar heating and neutrino cooling, delaying the evolution over $\sim 10^{3} \,[B/(5 \times 10^{15}\,\text{G})]^{-6/5}$ yr. Although the surface luminosity is enhanced compared to passive cooling, the heating from ambipolar diffusion alone is insufficient to fully explain the persistent X-ray emission observed in magnetars.
#### Resistive Collapse of 2D Non-rotating Magnetized Isothermal Toroids: Formation of Pseudodisks

 - **Abstract**
 The collapse of singular magnetized toroids (Li & Shu 1996) is a natural representation of an early phase in star formation, bridging the prestellar and protostellar phases of the collapse of molecular cloud cores. We revisit the collapse study of Allen et al. (2003b), now with explicit nonideal MHD (Ohmic diffusivity $\eta$) and higher resolution using a code able to cover a broader range of the magnetization parameter $H_0$. Galli-Shu equatorial pseudodisks form for all values of $H_0$ and $\eta$, and the asymptotic central mass growth rate is in the scale $\dot{M}_*\sim(a^3/G)(1+H_0)$, where $a$ is the isothermal sound speed, consistent with previous results and predictions. The explicit Ohmic diffusivity makes the field line structure less radial than in previous work, connecting the pseudodisk more effectively to its surroundings. Matter can fall efficiently onto the pseudodisk surfaces, forming oblique shocks, where shock heating and large density gradients raise the possibility of rich astrochemistry. Pseudodisk size and structure are influenced by magnetic diffusivity. Force and velocity ratios were computed to explore the magnetic support within the pseudodisk and its induced slowdown in infall velocity. Magnetic diffusivity was measured to control the strength of these effects and their location within the pseudodisk. The dependence of the field line configurations, pseudodisk structure, and velocity ratios on magnetic diffusivity has observable consequences for collapsing envelopes.
#### Emergence of new oscillation modes in dark matter admixed neutron stars

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter admixed neutron stars provide a promising avenue for observationally probing the dark matter characteristic. In this study, we examine non-radial oscillations in neutron stars containing self-interacting dark matter, which interacts with normal matter exclusively via gravity. To achieve this, we derive a new set of perturbation equations for a multi-fluid system under the Cowling approximation. Using these equations, we analyze the oscillation spectra and identify additional modes associated with dark matter, alongside those of normal matter. We find that the frequency behavior becomes more intricate with increasing self-coupling strength of dark matter, particularly as the stellar structure transitions between dark core and dark halo configurations, depending on the total stellar mass. Nevertheless, we find that in the dark core structure, the fundamental ($f$) mode frequencies associated with dark matter exceed those of normal matter, at least when the central energy densities of both fluids are equal. Furthermore, we find that the $f$-mode frequencies associated with normal matter in dark core configurations adhere to a universal relation between the mass-scaled frequency and stellar compactness.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new simulations of the formation and evolution of the first star-forming cloud within a massive minihalo of mass of $1.05 \times 10^7\, M_{\odot}$, carried out using the GIZMO code with detailed modeling of primordial gas cooling and chemistry. Unlike previous studies that simulated the formation of the first stars within a smaller cosmological boxsize of $\sim 1-2$ Mpc, our work adopts initial conditions from the large-scale cosmological simulations, IllustrisTNG spanning $\sim 50$ Mpc to study the formation of primordial clouds that give birth to the first stars. We increase the original resolution of IllustrisTNG by a factor of $\sim10^5$ using a particle-splitting technique, achieving an extremely high resolution that allows us to resolve turbulence driven by gravitational collapse during early structure formation. We find that strong supersonic turbulence with a characteristic Mach number of $\sim 5.2$ naturally develops within the collapsing halo. This turbulence efficiently stirs the gas, promoting fragmentation of the star-forming cloud into multiple dense clumps. Among them, we identify a gravitationally bound core with a mass of $8.07\,M_{\odot}$ and a size of $0.03$ pc, which exceeds its local Jeans mass and is on the verge of collapsing into a star. Our results indicate that supersonic turbulence may be common in primordial halos and can play a crucial role in cloud-scale fragmentation, potentially lowering the characteristic mass scale of the first stars.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we perform a model-agnostic reconstruction of the cosmic expansion history by combining DESI-DR2 BAO and DES-SN5YR data, with a focus on geometric determination of characteristic redshifts where notable tensions in the expansion rate are found to emerge. Employing Gaussian process regression alongside knot-based spline techniques, we reconstruct cosmic distances and their derivatives to pinpoint these characteristic redshifts and infer $E(z)$. Our analysis reveals significant deviations of approximately 4 to 5$\sigma$ from the Planck 2018 $\Lambda$CDM predictions, particularly pronounced in the redshift range $z \sim 0.35-0.55$. These anomalies are consistently observed across both reconstruction methods and combined datasets, indicating robust late-time departures that could signal new physics beyond the standard cosmological framework. The joint use of BAO and SN probes enhances the precision of our constraints, allowing us to isolate these deviations without reliance on specific cosmological assumptions. Our findings underscore the role of characteristic redshifts as sensitive indicators of expansion rate anomalies and motivate further scrutiny with forthcoming datasets from DESI-5YR BAO, Euclid, and LSST. These future surveys will tighten constraints and help distinguish whether these late-time anomalies arise from new fundamental physics or unresolved systematics in the data.

 Novel studies are presented demonstrating that the data of ESA's XMM-Newton mission are efficiently used by an engaged and productive community. 87% of the available time budget during the reference period 2000-2024 of 556Ms was used in at least one of 8486 publications (84% of 16894 observations) with a re-use of a factor up to 15 in dedicated publications. The duration between observations and first publication peaks around 2 years with a second peak at 3 years. The publication rate remains stable at ~400 refereed articles per year. Since 2010, the annual number of first-time as well as last-time authors has remained constant at ~100 authors per year yielding ~4300 scientists engaged in research utilising XMM-Newton data including 570 lead (first) authors. We find 51% of first authors to have published for one year, 24% were active for up to six years, and 25% are permanently active yielding a core community of ~120 scientists. The considerable number of time-limited activities may indicate a high level of utilisation within the context of university education. All studied trends indicate a vital community with positive perspectives to continue their active interest in XMM-Newton for the future.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of supermassive black holes is an open question that has been explored considering gas- and collision-based formation channels to explain the high number of quasars observed in the early Universe. According to numerical simulations, supermassive stars can be formed in atomic cooling halos when protostars reach accretion rates greater than $\sim 10^{-2}~\mathrm{M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}}$ and fragmentation is inhibited on parsec scales. It remains uncertain, however, whether fragmentation on smaller scales leads to the formation of a star cluster instead of a supermassive star in the presence of possible cooling mechanisms. We explored the formation of a central massive object through collisions and the accretion of Population III stars in a primordial gas cloud in a gravitationally unstable system by varying the gas temperature and the degree of gravitational instability. We performed multiphysics simulations in the AMUSE framework with a hydrodynamical gas treatment through Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics and $N$-body dynamics for the protostars represented through sink particles. Our results show that central massive objects with masses $\sim 10^4~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ can be formed by accretion and collisions at different temperatures and that the most massive object can reach efficiencies of $\sim 0.61$ for atomic cooling conditions and $\sim 0.95$ for more unstable conditions. We observe a quasi-disk formation for warmer temperatures and a higher contribution through collisions to the mass of a central massive object. Our results show that the embedded cluster is in a supercompetitive accretion regime in which it obtains mass by accretion that is regulated by self-gravity. Our results suggest that in more unstable conditions with lower gas temperatures, a more massive supermassive black hole seed can form.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae undergoing a first-order quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase transition experience the collapse of the central proto-neutron star that leads to a second bounce. This event is accompanied by the release of a second neutrino burst. Unlike the first stellar core bounce neutrino burst which consists exclusively of electron neutrinos, the second burst is dominated by electron antineutrinos. Such a condition makes QCD supernovae an ideal site for the occurrence of fast neutrino flavor conversion (FFC), which can lead to rapid flavor equilibration and significantly impact the related neutrino signal. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of the conditions for fast flavor instability (FFI) around and after the second neutrino burst in a QCD phase transition supernova model launched from a 25~$M_\odot$ progenitor mass. We evaluate the relevant instability criteria and find two major phases of FFC. The first phase is closely associated with the collapse and the rapidly expanding shock wave, which is a direct consequence of the proto-neutron star collapse due to the phase transition. The second phase takes place a few milliseconds later when electron degeneracy is restored near the proto-neutron star surface. We also characterize the growth rate of FFI and estimate its impact on the evolution of the neutrino flavor content. The potential observational consequences on neutrino signals are evaluated by comparing a scenario assuming complete flavor equipartition with other scenarios without FFC. Finally, we investigate how FFC may influences $r$-process nucleosynthesis associated with QCD phase transition driven supernova explosions.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos from supernovae, especially those emitted during the late phase of core collapse, are essential for understanding the final stages of massive star evolution. We have been dedicated to developing methods for the analysis of neutrinos emitted during the late phase and observed at Super-Kamiokande (SK). Our previous studies have successfully demonstrated the potential of various analysis methods in extracting essential physical properties; however, the lack of background consideration has limited their practical application. In this study, we address this issue by incorporating a realistic treatment of the experimental signal and background events with the on-going SK experiment. We therefore optimize our analysis framework to reflect realistic observational conditions, including both signal and background events. Using this framework we study several long-time supernova models, simulating the late phase neutrino observation in SK and focusing in particular on the identification of the last observed event. We discuss the possibility of model discrimination methods using timing information from this last observed event.

 - **Abstract**
 Nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer calculations of red-supergiant and He-star explosions are presented, extending previous work to focus on the infrared emission from atoms and ions in the ejecta during the nebular-phase (i.e., ~200 to ~500d) -- molecules and dust are ignored. We cover non-rotating, solar-metallicity progenitors spanning an initial mass between 10 and about 40Msun, and exploding as Type II or Ibc supernovae (SNe). Both photometrically and spectroscopically, the SN II models evolve distinctly from the SN Ibc models, primarily because of the greater ejecta kinetic-energy-to-mass ratio in the latter, which leads to a greater gamma-ray escape together with a lower density and a higher ionization in our H-deficient ejecta. Type II SN models remain optically luminous at all times, whereas SN Ibc models progressively brighten in the infrared (which holds 80% of their luminosity at 500d), causing strong infrared lines such as [NeII]12.81mic or [NiII]6.634mic to evolve essentially at constant luminosity. We find that the strength of [NeII]12.81mic correlates with progenitor mass but with additional strong sensitivity to, for example, ejecta ionization -- this line radiates alone up to 20% of the SN luminosity after ~300d in our SN Ibc models. The numerous infrared Ni lines are found to be good tracers of the material that underwent explosive nucleosynthesis and can thus be used to constrain the level of 56Ni mixing in core-collapse SNe. The evolution of the integrated flux in infrared Fe and Co lines shows much diversity, which compromises their use as diagnostic of the 56Ni-decay power source in our models. Future spectroscopic observations of core-collapse SNe by the JWST will provide unprecedented information on the emission from atoms and ions in their ejecta, delivering critical constraints on the inner workings of massive star explosions.

 - **Abstract**
 New extragalactic measurements of the cloud population-averaged star formation (SF) efficiency per freefall time $\rm\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ from PHANGS show little sign of theoretically predicted dependencies on cloud-scale virial level or velocity dispersion. We explore ways to bring theory into consistency with observations, highlighting systematic variations in internal density structure that must happen together with an increase in virial level typical towards galaxy centers. To introduce these variations into conventional turbulence-regulated SF models we adopt three adjustments motivated by the host galaxy's influence on the cloud-scale: we incorporate self-gravity and a gas density distribution that contains a broad power-law (PL) component and resembles the structure observed in local resolved clouds, we let the internal gas kinematics include motion in the background potential and let this regulate the onset of self-gravitation, and we assume that the gas density distribution is in a steady-state for only a fraction of a freefall time. The combined result is a strong reduction to $\rm\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ predicted in multi-freefall (MFF) scenarios compared to purely lognormal probability density functions and variations that are tied to the PL slope $\alpha$. The $\alpha$ needed to match PHANGS $\rm\epsilon_{\rm ff}$'s vary systematically with environment in the sense that gas sitting furthest from virial balance contains more gas at high density. With this `galaxy regulation' behavior included, our `self-gravitating' sgMFF models function similar to the original, roughly `virialized cloud' single-freefall models. However, outside disks with their characteristic regulation, the flexible MFF models may be better suited.

 We carried out the near-infrared ($JHK_{\rm s}$) imaging polarimetric observation with the polarimeter SIRPOL on the Infrared Survey Facility (IRSF) 1.4 m telescope and [CII] line mapping observation with a Fabry-Pérot spectrometer on board a 100-cm TIFR balloon-borne far-infrared telescope toward NGC 6334, and revealed the relationship between the plane-of-sky (POS) magnetic fields and [CII] emission lines to investigate the star formation in the molecular cloud. The polarization vector map shows that the POS magnetic fields are approximately perpendicular to the main filament elongation of NGC 6334. On the other hand, the POS magnetic fields tend to be parallel or random for the other filaments in NGC 6334. The [CII] emission shows a distribution well aligned with the main filament. Strong [CII] emission is also seen in the hub-filament system. Since the main filament is sandwiched between two HII regions, it is most likely that gas is efficiently accreting from the shells of the HII regions along the magnetic field resulting in active star formation. This is consistent with the NGC 6334 being bright in [CII] emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Cyanopolyynes, a family of nitrogen containing carbon chains, are common in the interstellar medium and possibly form the backbone of species relevant to prebiotic chemistry. Following their gas phase formation, they are expected to freeze out on ice grains in cold interstellar regions. In this work we present the hydrogenation reaction network of isolated HC_{3}N, the smallest cyanopolyyne, that consists over-a-barrier radical-neutral reactions and barrierless radical-radical reactions. We employ density functional theory, coupled cluster and multiconfigurational methods to obtain activation and reaction energies for the hydrogenation network of HC_{3}N. This work explores the reaction network of the isolated molecule and constitutes a preview on the reactions occurring on the ice grain surface. We find that the reactions where the hydrogen atom adds to the carbon chain at carbon atom opposite of the cyano-group give the lowest and most narrow barriers. Subsequent hydrogenation leads to the astrochemically relevant vinyl cyanide and ethyl cyanide. Alternatively, the cyano-group can hydrogenate via radical-radical reactions, leading to the fully saturated propylamine. These results can be extrapolated to give insight into the general reactivity of carbon chains on interstellar ices.
#### Bursty or heavy? The surprise of bright Population III systems in the Reionization era

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of the first, so-called Population III (Pop III), stars has for long remained largely unconstrained. However, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) finally opened new concrete prospects for their detection during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), notably providing promising observational constraints on the Pop III ultra-violet luminosity function (UVLF) at $z \sim 6.5$. These preliminary data hint towards an unexpected population of UV-bright Pop III sources, which challenges the prevailing view that Pop III star formation is confined to molecular-cooling mini-halos. Here we show that there are two families of models that can explain these surprising observations, either by allowing for late-time Pop III formation within massive, atomic-cooling halos (with halo masses up to $M_\mathrm{up}^\mathrm{III} \gtrsim 10^{10.5} ~\mathrm{M_\odot}$) or by invoking a highly bursty Pop III star-formation activity (with a stochasticity parameter $\sigma_\mathrm{UV}^\mathrm{III} \gtrsim 1.5$). In these scenarios Pop III systems would have to be either heavier or burstier than usually assumed, underscoring the need to reconsider common assumptions about Pop III star-formation sites, and the potential implications of JWST candidates for current and future observations.
