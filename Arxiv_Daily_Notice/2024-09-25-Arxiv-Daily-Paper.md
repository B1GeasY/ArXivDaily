 - **Abstract**
 The clusters Abell 2061 and Abell 2067 in the Corona Borealis supercluster have been studied at different radio frequencies and are both known to host diffuse radio emission. The aim of this work is to investigate the radio emission in between them, suggested by low resolution observations. We analyse deep LOFAR HBA observations at 144 MHz to follow up on the possible intercluster filament suggested by previous 1.4 GHz observations. We investigate the radial profiles and the point-to-point surface brightness correlation of the emission in A2061 with radio and Xray observations, to describe the nature of the diffuse emission. We report the detection of diffuse radio emission on 800 kpc scale, more extended than previously known, reaching beyond the radio halo in A2061 towards A2067 and over the separation outside the two clusters R500 radii. We confirm the presence of a radio halo in A2061, while do not find evidence of diffuse emission in A2067. The surface brightness profile from the centre of A2061 shows an excess of emission with respect to the azimuthally averaged radio halo profile and X-ray background. We explore three different dynamical scenario to explain the nature of the diffuse emission. We analyse a trail of emission of 760 kpc between the radio halo and radio relic in A2061. This pre merger system closely resembles the two other cluster pairs where radio bridges connecting the radio halos on Mpc scales have been detected. The diffuse emission extends beyond each cluster R500 radius but in this unique case, the absence of the radio halo in A2067 is likely the reason for the observed 'gap' between the two systems. However, the point-to-point correlation results are challenging to explain. The classification of the emission remains unclear, and detailed spectral analysis and further Xray observations are required to understand the origin of the diffuse emission.
#### Dusty substructures induced by planets in ALMA disks: how dust growth and dynamics changes the picture

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary disks exhibit a rich variety of substructure in millimeter continuum emission, often attributed to unseen planets. As these planets carve gaps in the gas, dust particles can accumulate in the resulting pressure bumps, forming bright features in the dust continuum. We investigate the role of dust dynamics in the gap-opening process with 2D radiation hydrodynamics simulations of planet--disk interaction and a two-population dust component modeled as a pressureless fluid. We consider the opacity feedback and backreaction due to drag forces as mm grains accumulate in pressure bumps at different stages of dust growth. We find that dust dynamics can significantly affect the resulting substructure driven by the quasi-thermal-mass planet with $M_p/M_\star=10^{-4}$. Opacity feedback causes nonaxisymmetric features to become more compact in azimuth, whereas the drag-induced backreaction tends to dissolve nonaxisymmetries. For our fiducial model, this results in multiple concentric rings of dust rather than the expected vortices and corotating dust clumps found in models without dust feedback. A higher coagulation fraction disproportionately enhances the effect of dust opacity feedback, favoring the formation of crescents rather than rings. Our results suggest that turbulent diffusion is not always necessary to explain the rarity of observed nonaxisymmetric features, and that incorporating dust dynamics is vital for interpreting the observed substructure in protoplanetary disks. We also describe and test the implementation of the publicly-available dust fluid module in the PLUTO code.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents VARnet, a capable signal processing model for rapid astronomical timeseries analysis. VARnet leverages wavelet decomposition, a novel method of Fourier feature extraction via the Finite-Embedding Fourier Transform (FEFT), and deep learning to detect faint signals in light curves, utilizing the strengths of modern GPUs to achieve sub-millisecond single-source runtime. We apply VARnet to the NEOWISE Single-Exposure Database, which holds nearly 200 billion apparitions over 10.5 years of infrared sources on the entire sky. This paper devises a pipeline in order to extract variable candidates from the NEOWISE data, serving as a proof of concept for both the efficacy of VARnet and methods for an upcoming variability survey over the entirety of the NEOWISE dataset. We implement models and simulations to synthesize unique light curves to train VARnet. In this case, the model achieves an F1 score of $0.91$ over a 4-class classification scheme on a validation set of real variable sources present in the infrared. With $\sim2000$ points per light curve on a GPU with 22GB of VRAM, VARnet produces a per-source processing time of $<53\mu s$. We confirm that our VARnet is sensitive and precise to both known and previously undiscovered variable sources. These methods prove promising for a complete future survey of variability with WISE, and effectively showcase the power of the VARnet model architecture.

 - **Abstract**
 The Polstar small explorer concept is for an ultraviolet (UV) spectropolarimetry space telescope mission with a focus on massive star astrophysics. The instrument waveband will be from 115 nm - 286 nm for spectroscopy and 122 nm - 286 nm for polarimetry. All 4 Stokes parameters, IQUV, will be measured at a resolving power of R=20,000 (15 km/s velocity resolution). The telescope aperture will be 40 cm with an effective area of about 22 cm^2 at a reference wavelength of 150 nm. The thrust of the science goals will be to determine the astrophysics of angular momentum exchange and transport, and consequences for massive star properties and evolution. This includes the effects of rapid to critical rotation for individual stars (magnetic and non-magnetic), and the effects of mass transfer for massive binaries, including identification of stripped core stars. If selected by the NASA/SMEX program, Polstar would launch around 2031 and observe ~300 stars to achieve science goals. The mission will include a Guest Observer program to advance discovery in other areas of astrophysics.
#### Revisiting the Local Interstellar Radiation Field using Gaia DR3

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Dust grains in the interstellar medium are heated by the integrated radiation from stars in the Milky Way. A knowledge of the Local Interstellar Radiation Field (LISRF) is thus necessary to interpret observations of dust emission in the infrared and constrain (some of) the properties of interstellar grains. The LISRF representation most widely used in dust modelling still dates back to the seminal works of Mezger et al. (1982) and Mathis et al. (1983). Aims: A new version of the LISRF is presented, starting from the photometry of the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) and revisiting available data, among which observations from the Pioneer 10 and 11 probes. Methods: The LISRF contribution by direct starlight is estimated in the Gaia bands by summing fluxes of all stars in DR3; the LISRF is extrapolated from the optical to the ultraviolet and near-infrared, using the astrophysical parameters provided by DR3 for a subsample of Gaia stars; the correlation between dust emission at 100 um and residual diffuse emission in the Pioneer and other available maps is exploited to derive the contribution of dust-scattered starlight to the LISRF. Results: The new LISRF is significantly redder and emits ~30% more energy than the old model. The old LISRF is almost a factor two lower in the near-infrared, while in the optical it accounts only for direct starlight. For |b|<50 degree, diffuse starlight contributes on average to ~25% of the total radiation, 3x more than what predicted by literature estimates at high Galactic latitude. Conclusions: The new LISRF can modify the predicted mid-infrared dust emission beyond the uncertainties normally assumed between dust models and observational constraints; these differences should be taken into account to redefine the properties of small grains and of the carriers of the mid-infrared emission bands.
#### Gaia BH1 and BH2 - Evolutionary Models with Overshooting of the Black Hole Progenitors within the Present-Day Binary Separation

 - **Abstract**
 Three black holes (BHs) in wide binaries - Gaia BH1, BH2 and BH3 - were recently discovered. The likely progenitors of the BHs were massive stars that experienced a supergiant phase, reaching radii of ~1000 Rsun, before collapsing to form the BH. Such radii are difficult to accommodate with the present-day orbits of BH1 and BH2 - with semi-major axes of 1.4 and 3.7 au, respectively. In this letter, we show that the maximal radii of the supergiants are not necessarily so large, and realistic stellar evolution models, with some assumed overshooting above the convective core into the radiative stellar envelope, produce substantially smaller maximal radii. The limited expansion of supergiants is consistent with the empirical Humphreys-Davidson limit - the absence of red supergiants above an upper luminosity limit, notably lower than the highest luminosity of main-sequence stars. We propose that the evolution that led to the formation of Gaia BH1 and BH2 simply did not involve an expansion to the cool supergiant phase.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we explore a novel framework for explaining the mass and radius relationships of observed neutron stars by considering strange stars (SSs) admixed with mirror dark matter (MDM). We develop a theoretical model that incorporates non-commutative algebra to describe the interactions between ordinary strange quark matter (SQM) and MDM, which are predicted to form compact objects that could explain recent astrophysical data, including observations of PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0437-4715, and the central compact object in HESS J1731-347. Notably, we demonstrate that the exotic mass-radius measurement of XTE J1814-338 can be explained by the presence of a mirror SS with an ordinary SQM core. In contrast to other explanations based on boson stars, our SS+MDM model offers a natural explanation for this system. We provide detailed mass-radius comparisons with observational data and discuss future observations that could test the predictions of our model, offering new insights into neutron star structure and the role of dark matter in compact objects.

 - **Abstract**
 CORSIKA 8 is a new framework for simulations of particle cascades in air and dense media implemented in modern C++17, based on past experience with existing codes, in particular CORSIKA 7. The flexible and modular structure of the project allows the development of independent modules that can produce a fully customizable particle shower simulation. The radio module in particular is designed to treat the electric field calculation and its propagation through complex media to each observer location in an autonomous and flexible way. It already allows for the simultaneous simulation of the radio emission calculated with two independent time-domain formalisms, the "Endpoint formalism" as previously implemented in CoREAS and the "ZHS" algorithm as ported from ZHAireS. The design acts as the baseline interface for current and future development for the simulation of radio emission from particle showers in standard and complex scenarios, such as cross-media showers penetrating from air into ice. In this work, we present the design and implementation of the radio module in CORSIKA 8, along with validation studies and a direct comparison of the radio emission from air showers simulated with CORSIKA 8, CORSIKA 7 and ZHAireS. We also present the impact of simulation details such as the step size of simulated particle tracks on radio-emission simulations and perform a direct comparison of the "Endpoints" and "ZHS" formalisms for the same underlying air showers. Finally, we present an in-depth comparison of CORSIKA 8 and CORSIKA 7 for optimum simulation settings and discuss the relevance of observed differences in light of reconstruction efforts for the energy and mass of cosmic rays.
#### JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS). HH 211: the textbook case of a protostellar jet and outflow

 - **Abstract**
 We use the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and its Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) (5-28 um), to study the embedded HH 211 flow. We map a 0.95'x0.22' region, covering the full extent of the blue-shifted lobe, the central protostellar region, and a small portion of the red-shifted lobe. The jet driving source is not detected even at the longest mid-IR wavelengths. The overall morphology of the flow consists of a highly collimated jet, mostly molecular (H2, HD) with an inner atomic ([FeI], [FeII], [SI], [NiII]) structure. The jet shocks the ambient medium, producing several large bow-shocks, rich in forbidden atomic and molecular lines, and is driving an H2 molecular outflow, mostly traced by low-J, v=0 transitions. Moreover, 0-0 S(1) uncollimated emission is also detected down to 2"-3" (~650-1000 au) from the source, tracing a cold (T=200-400 K), less dense and poorly collimated molecular wind. The atomic jet ([FeII] at 26 um) is detected down to ~130 au from source, whereas the lack of H2 emission close to the source is likely due to the large visual extinction. Dust continuum-emission is detected at the terminal bow-shocks, and in the blue- and red-shifted jet, being likely dust lifted from the disk. The jet shows an onion-like structure, with layers of different size, velocity, temperature, and chemical composition. Moreover, moving from the inner jet to the outer bow-shocks, different physical, kinematic and excitation conditions for both molecular and atomic gas are observed. The jet mass-flux rate, momentum, and momentum flux of the warm H2 component are up to one order of magnitude higher than those inferred from the atomic jet component. Our findings indicate that the warm H2 component is the primary mover of the outflow, namely it is the most significant dynamical component of the jet, in contrast to jets from more evolved YSOs, where the atomic component is dominant.

 - **Abstract**
 A hadron-quark phase transition (PT) may trigger supernova explosions during stellar core collapse. However, both success and failure have occurred in previous attempts to explode dying stars via this mechanism. We systematically explore the outcomes of the PT-induced collapse of proto-compact stars (PCSs), with spherically symmetric general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and a controlled series of hybrid equations of state. Our results reveal the dependence of successful and failed explosions on the PT and quark matter characteristics. A small portion ($\sim\!0.04\%\!-\!1\%$) of the released binding energy $\Delta E_B$ transforms into the diagnostic explosion energy $E_{\rm exp,diag}$, which saturates at $\sim\!6\times10^{51}\,\rm{erg}$ near the black hole formation. We draw the phase diagrams for the possible fates of supernova explosions driven by hadron-quark PTs, where the control parameters are the onset density, energy gap of the PT, and the quark matter speed of sound. Our findings can be used to guide further investigations on PT-driven core-collapse supernovae and help identify hadron-quark PT-induced PCS collapse from future observations.
#### Extreme Weather Variability on Hot Rocky Exoplanet 55 Cancri e Explained by Magma Temperature-Cloud Feedback

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of the ultra-short period rocky exoplanet 55 Cancri e (55 Cnc e) indicate that the planet's dayside infrared radiation fluctuates by a factor of at least six on sub-weekly timescales, for unknown reasons. We propose a feedback mechanism where increased reflective clouds cool surface magma, subsequently reducing cloud formation, which may offer a potential explanation for these phenomena. In this mechanism, under less cloudy conditions, stellar radiation heats the surface magma, causing it to release more silicate vapor, which then condenses to form reflective clouds. Once formed, these clouds reduce stellar insolation at the surface, leading to surface cooling, which in turn reduces vapor supply, decreasing cloudiness. A time lag between the temperature increase of surface magma and the subsequent increase in cloudiness (likely due to lagged atmospheric transport of cloud-forming vapor) enables self-sustained oscillations in surface temperature and cloud reflectivity. These oscillations manifest as variations in both the emitted thermal radiation and the reflected stellar radiation, causing variability in secondary eclipse depths across different wavelengths without significantly affecting the transit depth. Using a simple model, we find that diverse planetary parameters can reproduce the observations. Additionally, we demonstrate that secondary eclipse depths at different wavelengths can oscillate out of phase, consistent with recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope. Finally, we discuss observational strategies to test this proposed mechanism on 55 Cancri e. If confirmed, observable ocean-atmosphere dynamics on exoplanets would open a new window into the composition, evolution, and fate of rocky planet volatiles.
