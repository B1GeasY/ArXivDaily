 - **Abstract**
 Eruptive mass loss in massive stars is known to occur, but the mechanism(s) are not yet well-understood. One proposed physical explanation appeals to opacity-driven super-Eddington luminosities in stellar envelopes. Here, we present a 1D model for eruptive mass loss and implement this model in the MESA stellar evolution code. The model identifies regions in the star where the energy associated with a locally super-Eddington luminosity exceeds the binding energy of the overlaying envelope. The material above such regions is ejected from the star. Stars with masses $10-100~M_\odot$ at solar and SMC metallicities are evolved through core helium burning, with and without this new eruptive mass-loss scheme. We find that eruptive mass loss of up to $\sim10^{-2}~M_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ can be driven by this mechanism, and occurs in a vertical band on the HR diagram between $3.5 \lesssim \log(T_\mathrm{eff}/\mathrm{K}) \lesssim 4.0$. This predicted eruptive mass loss prevents stars of initial masses $\gtrsim20~M_\odot$ from evolving to become red supergiants, with the stars instead ending their lives as blue supergiants, and therefore offers a possible explanation for the observed lack of red supergiants in that mass regime.

 - **Abstract**
 Two main mechanisms have classically been proposed for the formation of runaway stars. The binary supernova scenario (BSS) suggests that a massive star in a binary explodes as a supernova, ejecting its companion. The dynamical ejection scenario suggests that a star is ejected through a strong dynamical encounter between multiple stars. We propose a third mechanism for the formation of runaway stars: the sub-cluster ejection scenario (SCES), where an infalling sub-cluster of stars is ejected out of the cluster by a slingshot interaction with the contracting gravitational potential of the assembling cluster. We demonstrate the SCES in a star-by-star simulation of a young massive cluster forming from a $10^6\rm~M_\odot$ gas cloud using the Torch framework. This star cluster forms hierarchically through a sequence of sub-cluster mergers, determined by the initial turbulent, spherical initial conditions of the gas. We find that these mergers drive the formation of runaway stars in our model. Late-forming sub-clusters fall into the central potential, where they are ejected on a slingshot trajectory, forming groups of runaway stars that are distributed highly anisotropically. Runaways formed by the same SCES share similar ages, velocities, and ejection directions. Surveying observations, we identify several SCES candidate groups with anisotropic ejection directions. The SCES is capable of producing runaway binaries: two wide dynamical binaries in infalling sub-clusters were tightened through ejection. This allows for another velocity kick via subsequent BSS, which is a promising avenue for producing hypervelocity stars unbound to the Galaxy. The SCES occurs when sub-cluster formation is resolved. We expect non-spherical initial gas distributions to increase runaway star numbers. The observation of groups of runaway stars formed via SCES thus reveals the assembly history of their natal clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-wavelength polarimetry and radio observations of Swift J1727.8-1613 at the beginning of its recent 2023 outburst suggested the presence of a bright compact jet aligned in the north-south direction, which could not be confirmed without high angular resolution images. Using the Very Long Baseline Array and the Long Baseline Array, we imaged Swift J1727.8-1613, during the hard/hard-intermediate state, revealing a bright core and a large, two-sided, asymmetrical, resolved jet. The jet extends in the north-south direction, at a position angle of $-0.60\pm0.07°$ East of North. At 8.4 GHz, the entire resolved jet structure is $\sim110 (d/2.7\,\text{kpc})/\sin i$ AU long, with the southern approaching jet extending $\sim80 (d/2.7\,\text{kpc})/\sin i$ AU from the core, where $d$ is the distance to the source and $i$ is the inclination of the jet axis to the line of sight. These images reveal the most resolved continuous X-ray binary jet, and possibly the most physically extended continuous X-ray binary jet ever observed. Based on the brightness ratio of the approaching and receding jets, we put a lower limit on the intrinsic jet speed of $\beta\geq0.27$ and an upper limit on the jet inclination of $i\leq74°$. In our first observation we also detected a rapidly fading discrete jet knot $66.89\pm0.04$ mas south of the core, with a proper motion of $0.66\pm0.05$ mas hour$^{-1}$, which we interpret as the result of a downstream internal shock or a jet-ISM interaction, as opposed to a transient relativistic jet launched at the beginning of the outburst.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe the space observatory architecture and mission design of the SALTUS mission, a NASA Astrophysics Probe Explorer concept. SALTUS will address key far-infrared science using a 14-m diameter <45 K primary reflector (M1) and will provide unprecedented levels of spectral sensitivity for planet, solar system, and galactic evolution studies, and cosmic origins. Drawing from Northrop Grumman's extensive NASA mission heritage, the observatory flight system is based on the LEOStar-3 spacecraft platform to carry the SALTUS Payload. The Payload is comprised of the inflation control system (ICS), Sunshield Module (SM), Cold Corrector Module (CCM), Warm Instrument Electronics Module, and Primary Reflector Module (PRM). The 14-m M1 is an off-axis inflatable membrane radiatively cooled by a two-layer sunshield (~1,000 m2 per layer). The CCM corrects for residual aberration from M1 and delivers a focused beam to two instruments - High Resolution Receiver (HiRX) and SAFARI-Lite. The CCM and PRM reside atop a truss-based composite deck which also provides a platform for the attitude control system. The 5-year mission lifetime is driven by a two-consumable architecture: the propellant system and the ICS. The Core Interface Module (CIM), a multi-faceted composite truss structure, provides a load path with high stiffness, mechanical attachment, and thermal separation between the Payload and spacecraft. The SM attaches outside the CIM with its aft end integrating directly to the bus. The spacecraft maintains an attitude off M1's boresight with respect to the Sun line to facilitate the <45 K thermal environment. SALTUS will reside in a Sun-Earth halo L2 orbit with a maximum Earth slant range of 1.8 million km thereby reducing orbit transfer delta-v. The instantaneous field of regard provides two continuous 20-deg viewing zones around the ecliptic poles resulting in full sky coverage in six months.

 - **Abstract**
 H$\alpha$ emission is a clear indicator of circumstellar activity in Be stars, historically employed to assess the classical Be star (CBe) population in young open clusters (YOCs). The YOC NGC330 in the Small Magellanic Cloud exhibits a large known fraction of {CBe} stars and was selected for a pilot study to establish a comprehensive methodology for identifying H$\alpha$ emitters in the Magellanic Clouds, encompassing the entire B-type spectral range. Using the SOAR Adaptative Module Imager (SAMI), we investigated the stellar population of NGC330 using multi-band BVRI+H$\alpha$ imaging. We identified H$\alpha$ emitters within the entire V-band range covered by SAMI/SOAR observations ($V\lesssim22$), comprising the complete B-type stellar population and offering a unique opportunity to explore the Be phenomenon across all spectral sub-classes. The stellar radial distribution shows a clear bimodal pattern between the most massive (B5 or earlier) and the lower-mass main-sequence objects (later than B6) within the cluster. The former is concentrated towards the cluster center (showing a dispersion of $\sigma=4.26\pm0.20$ pc), whereas the latter extends across larger radii ($\sigma=10.83\pm0.65$ pc), indicating mass stratification within NGC330. The total fraction of emitters is $4.4\pm0.5\%$, notably smaller than previous estimates from flux- or seeing-limited observations. However, a higher fraction of H$\alpha$ emitters is observed among higher-mass stars ($32.8\pm3.4\%$) than within lower-mass ($4.4\pm0.9\%$). Consequently, the putative CBe population exhibits distinct dynamical characteristics compared to the bulk of the stellar population in NGC330. These findings highlight the significance of the current observations in providing a complete picture of the CBe population in NGC330.

          Chemical evolution of the Galactic bulge with different stellar populations

 - **Abstract**
 The metallicity distribution function (MDF) of the Galactic bulge features a multi-peak shape, with a metal-poor peak at [Fe/H]=-0.3 dex and a metal-rich peak at [Fe/H]=+0.3 dex. This bimodality is also seen in [alpha/Fe] versus [Fe/H] ratios, indicating different stellar populations in the bulge. We aim to replicate the observed MDF by proposing a scenario where the metal-poor bulge stars formed in situ during an intense star formation burst, while the metal-rich stars formed during a second burst and/or were accreted from the inner Galactic disk due to a growing bar. We used a chemical evolution model that tracks various chemical species with detailed nucleosynthesis, focusing on Fe production from both Type Ia supernovae and massive stars, including rotating massive stars with varying velocities. Our model also accounts for gas infall, outflow, and the effect of stellar migration. Results are compared to 13,000 stars from the SDSS/APOGEE survey within 3.5 kpc of the Galactic center. Our model successfully reproduces the double-peak shape of the bulge MDF and the alpha-element abundance trends relative to Fe by assuming (i) a multi-burst star formation history with a 250 Myr quenching of the first burst and (ii) stellar migration from the inner disk due to a growing bar. We estimate that about 40% of the bulge-bar's stellar mass originates from the inner disk. Nucleosynthesis models that assume either no rotation for massive stars or a rotational velocity distribution favoring slow rotation at high metallicities best match the observed MDF and [alpha/Fe] and [Ce/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance patterns.

 - **Abstract**
 We report high-frequency pulsations in WR135 from short cadence optical photometric and spectroscopic time series surveys. The harmonics up to $6^{th}$ order are detected from the integrated photometric flux variation while the comparatively weaker $8^{th}$ harmonic is detected from the varying strengths of the least blended emission lines. We investigate the atmospheric stratification of the stellar winds of WR135 using a radiative transfer modeling code, CMFGEN, and find the physical conditions that can support the propagation of such pulsations. From our study, we find that the sub-sonic layers of the atmosphere are close to the Eddington limit and are launched by the Fe-opacity. While the outer optically thin super-sonic winds ($\tau_{ross}$=0.1-0.01) are driven by the He II and C IV opacities. The stratified winds above the sonic point undergo velocity perturbation that can lead to clumps. We find that the optically thin supersonic winds ($\tau_{ross}$=0.1-0.01) contain dense smaller clumps (f=0.2-0.3) that oscillate under the higher-order harmonics of the pulsation. These clumps grow larger (f=0.1), dominate the outer stellar winds ($\tau_{ross}$=0.01-0.001), and oscillate under the lower-order harmonics.

 - **Abstract**
 Partially ionised plasmas (PIP) constitute an essential ingredient of our plasma universe. Historically, the physical effects associated with partial ionisation were considered in astrophysical topics such as the interstellar medium, molecular clouds, accretion disks and, later on, in solar physics. PIP can be found in layers of the Sun's atmosphere as well as in solar structures embedded within it. As a consequence, the dynamical behaviour of these layers and structures is influenced by the different physical effects introduced by partial ionisation. Here, rather than considering an exhaustive discussion of partially ionised effects in the different layers and structures of the solar atmosphere, we focus on solar prominences. The reason is that they represent a paradigmatic case of a partially ionised solar plasma, confined and insulated by the magnetic field, constituting an ideal environment to study the effects induced by partial ionisation. We present the current knowledge about the effects of partial ionisation in the global stability, mass cycle and dynamics of solar prominences. We revise the identified observational signatures of partial ionisation in prominences. We conclude with prospects for PIP research in prominences, proposing the path for advancing in the prominence modelling and theory and using new and upcoming instrumentation.

 Sub-Neptunes with $2-3R_\oplus$ are intermediate in size between rocky planets and Neptune-sized planets. The orbital properties and bulk compositions of transiting sub-Neptunes provide clues to the formation and evolution of close-in small planets. In this paper, we present the discovery and follow-up of four sub-Neptunes orbiting M dwarfs (TOI-782, TOI-1448, TOI-2120, and TOI-2406), three of which were newly validated by ground-based follow-up observations and statistical analyses. TOI-782 b, TOI-1448 b, TOI-2120 b, and TOI-2406 b have radii of $R_\mathrm{p} = 2.740^{+0.082}_{-0.079}\,R_\oplus$, $2.769^{+0.073}_{-0.068}\,R_\oplus$, $2.120\pm0.067\,R_\oplus$, and $2.830^{+0.068}_{-0.066}\,R_\oplus$ and orbital periods of $P = 8.02$, $8.11$, $5.80$, and $3.08$\,days, respectively. Doppler monitoring with Subaru/InfraRed Doppler instrument led to 2$\sigma$ upper limits on the masses of $<19.1\ M_\oplus$, $<19.5\ M_\oplus$, $<6.8\ M_\oplus$, and $<15.6\ M_\oplus$ for TOI-782 b, TOI-1448 b, TOI-2120 b, and TOI-2406 b, respectively. The mass-radius relationship of these four sub-Neptunes testifies to the existence of volatile material in their interiors. These four sub-Neptunes, which are located above the so-called ``radius valley'', are likely to retain a significant atmosphere and/or an icy mantle on the core, such as a water world. We find that at least three of the four sub-Neptunes (TOI-782 b, TOI-2120 b, and TOI-2406 b) orbiting M dwarfs older than 1 Gyr, are likely to have eccentricities of $e \sim 0.2-0.3$. The fact that tidal circularization of their orbits is not achieved over 1 Gyr suggests inefficient tidal dissipation in their interiors.

          Constraints on the (re-)orientation of star-disk systems through infall

 - **Abstract**
 It has been consensus that star-disk systems accrete most of their mass and angular momentum during the collapse of a prestellar core, such that the rotational direction of a system is equivalent to the net rotation of the core. Recent results, however, indicate that stars experience post-collapse or late infall, during which the star and its disk is refreshed with material from the protostellar environment through accretion streamers. Apart from adding mass to the star-disk system, infall potentially supplies a substantial amount of angular momentum as the infalling material is initially not bound to the collapsing prestellar core. We investigate the orientation of infall on star-disk systems by analyzing the properties of accreting tracer particles in 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations of a molecular cloud that is (4 pc)$^3$ in volume. In contrast to the traditional picture, where the rotational axis is inherited from the collapse of a coherent pre-stellar core, the orientation of star-disk systems can change substantially during the accretion process. In agreement with previous results that show larger contributions of late infall for increasing stellar masses, infall is more likely to lead to a prolonged change in orientation for stars of higher final mass. On average, brown dwarfs and very low mass stars are more likely to form and accrete all of their mass as part of a multiple system, while stars with final masses above a few 0.1 M$_{\odot}$ are more likely to accrete part of their mass as single stars. Finally, we find an overall trend: the post-collapse accretion phase is more anisotropic than the early collapse phase. This result is consistent with a scenario, where mass accretion from infall occurs via infalling streamers along a preferred direction, while the initial collapse is less anisotropic albeit the fact that material is funneled through accretion channels.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. As a new growing field, exocartography aims to map the surface features of exoplanets that are beyond the resolution of traditional observing techniques. While photometric approaches have been discussed extensively, polarimetry has received less attention despite its promising prospects. Aims. We demonstrate that the limb polarization of an exoplanetary atmosphere offers valuable insights into its cloud cover distribution. Specifically, we determine an upper limit for the polarimetric precision, which is required to extract information about the latitudinal cloud cover of temperate Jovian planets for scenarios of observations with and without host stars. Methods. To compute the scattered stellar radiation of an exoplanetary atmosphere and to study the polarization at various planetary phase angles, we used the three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer code POLARIS. Results. When the planetary signal can be measured separately from the stellar radiation, information about the latitudinal cloud cover for polar cap models is accessible at polarimetric sensitivities of $0.1$ %. In contrast, a precision of about $10^{-3}$ ppm is required when the stellar flux is included to gain this information.

          No signature of the birth environment of exoplanets from their host stars' Mahalanobis phase space

 - **Abstract**
 The architectures of extrasolar planetary systems often deviate considerably from the ``standard" model for planet formation, which is largely based on our own Solar System. In particular, gas giants on close orbits are not predicted by planet formation theory and so some process(es) are thought to move the planets closer to their host stars. Recent research has suggested that Hot Jupiter host stars display a different phase space compared to stars that do not host Hot Jupiters. This has been attributed to these stars forming in star-forming regions of high stellar density, where dynamical interactions with passing stars have perturbed the planets. We test this hypothesis by quantifying the phase space of planet-hosting stars in dynamical N-body simulations of star-forming regions. We find that stars that retain their planets have a higher phase space than non-hosts, regardless of their initial physical density. This is because an imprint of the kinematic substructure from the regions birth is retained, as these stars have experienced fewer and less disruptive encounters than stars whose planets have been liberated and become free-floating. However, host stars whose planets remain bound but have had their orbits significantly altered by dynamical encounters are also primarily found in high phase space regimes. We therefore corroborate other research in this area which has suggested the high phase space of Hot Jupiter host stars is not caused by dynamical encounters or stellar clustering, but rather reflects an age bias in that these stars are (kinematically) younger than other exoplanet host stars.

          Expanded Sample of Small Magellanic Cloud Ultraviolet Dust Extinction Curves: Correlations between the 2175 A bump, q_pah, UV extinction shape, and N(HI)/A(V)

 - **Abstract**
 The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) shows a large variation in ultraviolet (UV) dust extinction curves, ranging from Milky Way-like (MW) to significantly steeper curves with no detectable 2175 A bump. This result is based on a sample of only nine sightlines. From HST/STIS and IUE spectra of OB stars, we have measured UV extinction curves along 32 SMC sightlines where eight of these curves were published previously. We find 16 sightlines with steep extinction with no detectable 2175 A bump, four sightlines with MW-like extinction with a detectable 2175 A bump, two sightlines with fairly flat UV extinction and weak/absent 2175 A bumps, and 10 sightlines with unreliable curves due to low SMC dust columns. Our expanded sample shows that the sightlines with and without the 2175 A bump are located throughout the SMC and not limited to specific regions. The average extinction curve of the 16 bumpless sightlines is very similar to the previous average based on four sightlines. We find no correlation between dust column and the strength of the 2175 A bump. We test the hypothesis that the 2175 A bump is due to the same dust grains that are responsible for the mid-infrared carbonaceous (PAH) emission features and find they are correlated, confirming recent work in the MW. Overall, the slope of the UV extinction increases as the amplitudes of the 2175 A bump and far-UV curvature decrease. Finally, the UV slope is correlated with $N(HI)/A(V)$ and the 2175 A bump and nonlinear far-UV rise amplitudes are anti-correlated with $N(HI)/A(V)$.

 - **Abstract**
 Nearby associations of stars which are coeval are important benchmark laboratories because they provide robust measurements of stellar ages. The study of such coeval groups makes it possible to better understand star formation by studying the initial mass function, the binary fraction or the circumstellar disks of stars, to determine how the initially dense populations of young stars gradually disperse to form the field population, and to shed light on how the properties of stars, exoplanets and substellar objects evolve with distinct snapshots along their lifetime. The advent of large-scale missions such as Gaia is reshaping our understanding or stellar kinematics in the Solar neighborhood and beyond, and offers the opportunity to detect a large number of loose, coeval stellar associations for the first time, which evaded prior detection because of their low density or the faintness of their members. In parallel, advances in detection and characterization of exoplanets and substellar objects are starting to unveil the detailed properties of extrasolar atmospheres, as well as population-level distributions in fundamental exoplanet properties such as radii, masses, and orbital parameters. Accurate ages are still sparsely available to interpret the evolution of both exoplanets and substellar objects, and both fields are now ripe for detailed age investigations because we are starting to uncover ever-closer low-density associations that previously escaped detection, as well as exoplanets and ever lower-mass members of more distant open clusters and star-forming regions. In this paper, we review some recent advances in the identification and characterization of nearby associations, the methods by which stellar ages are measured, and some of the direct applications of the study of young associations such as the emergent field of isolated planetary-mass objects.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an alternative model of unusual type-IIP SN 2018gj. Despite the short plateau and early gamma-rays escape seeming to favor low-mass ejecta, our hydrodynamic model requires a large ejected mass (about 23 Msun). The high ejecta velocity, we find from hydrogen lines in early spectra, is among crucial constraints on the hydrodynamic model. We recover the wind density that rules out a notable contribution of the circumstellar interaction to the bolometric luminosity. The early radioactive gamma-rays escape is found to be due to the high velocity of Ni-56, whereas the asymmetry of the H-alpha emission is attributed to the asymmetry of the Ni-56 ejecta. The available sample of type-IIP supernovae studied hydrodynamically in a uniform way indicates that the asymmetry of the Ni-56 ejecta is probably their intrinsic property. Hydrogen lines in the early spectra of SN 2018gi and SN 2020jfo are found to imply a clumpy structure of the outer ejecta. With two already known similar cases of SN 2008in and SN 2012A we speculate that the clumpiness of the outer ejecta is inherent to type-IIP supernovae related to the red supergiant explosion.

 - **Abstract**
 We advocate for a new paradigm of cosmological likelihood-based inference, leveraging recent developments in machine learning and its underlying technology, to accelerate Bayesian inference in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we combine (i) emulation, where a machine learning model is trained to mimic cosmological observables, e.g. CosmoPower-JAX; (ii) differentiable and probabilistic programming, e.g. JAX and NumPyro, respectively; (iii) scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques that exploit gradients, e.g. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo; and (iv) decoupled and scalable Bayesian model selection techniques that compute the Bayesian evidence purely from posterior samples, e.g. the learned harmonic mean implemented in harmonic. This paradigm allows us to carry out a complete Bayesian analysis, including both parameter estimation and model selection, in a fraction of the time of traditional approaches. First, we demonstrate the application of this paradigm on a simulated cosmic shear analysis for a Stage IV survey in 37- and 39-dimensional parameter spaces, comparing $\Lambda$CDM and a dynamical dark energy model ($w_0w_a$CDM). We recover posterior contours and evidence estimates that are in excellent agreement with those computed by the traditional nested sampling approach while reducing the computational cost from 8 months on 48 CPU cores to 2 days on 12 GPUs. Second, we consider a joint analysis between three simulated next-generation surveys, each performing a 3x2pt analysis, resulting in 157- and 159-dimensional parameter spaces. Standard nested sampling techniques are simply not feasible in this high-dimensional setting, requiring a projected 12 years of compute time on 48 CPU cores; on the other hand, the proposed approach only requires 8 days of compute time on 24 GPUs. All packages used in our analyses are publicly available.
