#### Title:
          Is the low-energy tail of shock-accelerated protons responsible for over-ionized plasma in supernova remnants?

 - **Abstract**
 Over-ionized, recombining plasma is an emerging class of X-ray bright supernova remnants (SNRs). This unique thermal state where the ionization temperature ($T_{\rm z}$) is significantly higher than the electron temperature ($T_{\rm e}$) is not expected from the standard evolution model assuming a point explosion in a uniform interstellar medium, requiring a new scenario for the dynamical and thermal evolution. A recently proposed idea attributes the over-ionization state to additional ionization contribution from the low-energy tail of shock-accelerated protons. However, this new scenario has been left untested, especially from the atomic physics point of view. We report calculation results of the proton impact ionization rates of heavy-element ions in ejecta of SNRs. We conservatively estimate the requirement for accelerated protons, and find that their relative number density to thermal electrons needs to be higher than $5~(T_{\rm e}/{\rm 1~keV})\%$ in order to explain the observed over-ionization degree at $T_{\rm z}/T_{\rm e} \ge 2$ for K-shell emission. We conclude that the proton ionization scenario is not feasible because such a high abundance of accelerated protons is prohibited by the injection fraction from thermal to non-thermal energies, which is expected to be $\sim 1\%$ at largest.

 - **Abstract**
 At high redshifts ($z\gtrsim12$), the relative velocity between baryons and dark matter (the so-called streaming velocity) significantly affects star formation in low-mass objects. Streaming substantially reduces the abundance of low-mass gas objects while simultaneously allowing for the formation of supersonically-induced gas objects (SIGOs) and their associated star clusters outside of dark matter halos. Here, we present a study of the population-level effects of streaming on star formation within both halos and SIGOs in a set of simulations with and without streaming. Notably, we find that streaming actually enhances star formation within individual halos of all masses at redshifts between $z=12$ and $z=20$. This is demonstrated both as an increased star formation rate per object as well as an enhancement of the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation for objects with streaming. We find that our simulations are consistent with some observations at high redshift, but on a population level, they continue to under-predict star formation relative to the majority of observations. However, simulations of overdense regions (both with and without streaming) agree with observations, suggesting a strategy for extracting information about the overdensity and streaming velocity in a given survey volume in future observations.
#### Title:
          First detection of X-ray pulsations and spectrum of the high Galactic latitude pulsar PSR J0837-2454 and direct Urca cooling implications

 - **Abstract**
 PSR J0837-2454 is a young 629 ms radio pulsar whose uncertain distance has important implications. A large distance would place the pulsar far out of the Galactic plane and suggest it is the result of a runaway star, while a short distance would mean the pulsar is extraordinarily cold. Here we present further radio observations and the first deep X-ray observation of PSR J0837-2454. Data from the Parkes Murriyang telescope show flux variations over short and long timescales and also yield an updated timing model, while the position and proper motion (and, less strongly, parallax) of the pulsar are constrained by a number of low-significance detections with the Very Long Baseline Array. XMM-Newton data enable detection of X-ray pulsations for the first time from this pulsar and yield a spectrum that is thermal and blackbody-like, with a cool blackbody temperature ~70 eV or atmosphere temperature ~50 eV, as well as a small hotspot. The spectrum also indicates the pulsar is at a small distance of <~1 kpc, which is compatible with the marginal VLBA parallax constraint that favours a distance of >~330 pc. The low implied X-ray luminosity (~3x10^31 erg s^-1 at 0.9 kpc) suggests PSR J0837-2454 has a mass high enough that fast neutrino emission from direct Urca reactions operates in this young star and points to a nuclear equation of state that allows for direct Urca reactions at the highest densities present in neutron star cores.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the nature of the luminous 1991T-like supernovae is of great importance to supernova cosmology as they are likely to have been more common in the early universe. In this paper we explore the observational properties of 1991T-like supernovae to study their relationship to other luminous, slow-declining Type~Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). From the spectroscopic and photometric criteria defined in Phillips et al. (1992), we identify 17 1991T-like supernovae from the literature. Combining these objects with ten 1991T-like supernovae from the Carnegie Supernova Project-II, the spectra, light curves, and colors of these events, along with their host galaxy properties, are examined in detail. We conclude that 1991T-like supernovae are closely related in essentially all of their UV, optical, and near-infrared properties -- as well as their host galaxy parameters -- to the slow-declining subset of Branch core-normal supernovae and to the intermediate 1999aa-like events, forming a continuum of luminous SNe Ia. The overriding difference between these three subgroups appears to be the extent to which $^{56}$Ni mixes into the ejecta, producing the pre-maximum spectra dominated by Fe III absorption, the broader UV light curves, and the higher luminosities that characterize the 1991T-like events. Nevertheless, the association of 1991T-like SNe with the rare Type Ia CSM supernovae would seem to run counter to this hypothesis, in which case 1991T-like events may form a separate subclass of SNe Ia, possibly arising from single-degenerate progenitor systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations have suggested that the first stars in the universe often form as binary or multiple systems. However, previous studies typically overlooked the potential influence of magnetic fields during this process, assuming them to be weak and minimally impactful. Emerging theoretical investigations, however, propose an alternative perspective, suggesting that turbulent dynamo effects within first-star forming clouds can generate strong magnetic fields. In this study, we perform three-dimensional ideal magnetohydrodynamics simulations, starting from the gravitational collapse of a turbulent cloud core to the early accretion phase, where disk fragmentation frequently occurs. Our findings reveal that turbulent magnetic fields, if they reach an equipartition level with turbulence energy across all scales during the collapse phase, can significantly affect the properties of the multiple systems. Specifically, both magnetic pressure and torques contribute to disk stabilization, leading to a reduction in the number of fragments, particularly for low-mass stars. Additionally, our observations indicate the launching of protostellar jets driven by magnetic pressure of toroidal fields, although their overall impact on star formation dynamics appears to be minor. Given the case with which seed magnetic fields amplify to the full equipartition level, our results suggest that magnetic fields likely play a significant role in shaping the initial mass function of the first stars, highlighting the importance of magnetic effects on star formation in the early universe.

          Particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification by relativistic shocks in inhomogeneous media

 - **Abstract**
 Particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification in relativistic shocks propagating in inhomogeneous media are investigated by three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations and test-particle simulations. The MHD simulations show that the interaction between the relativistic shock and dense clumps amplifies the downstream magnetic field to the value expected from observations of the gamma-ray burst. The test-particle simulations in the electromagnetic field given by the MHD simulation show that particles are accelerated by the downstream turbulence and the relativistic shock. We provide the injection energy to the shock acceleration in this system. If the amplitude of upstream density fluctuations is sufficiently large, low-energy particles are initially accelerated to the injection energy by the downstream turbulence and then rapidly accelerated to higher energies by the relativistic shock. Therefore, the density fluctuation significantly affects particle acceleration in the relativistic shock.

          Self-Gravitational Dynamics Within the Inner Oort Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of the Inner Oort Cloud (IOC) - a vast halo of icy bodies residing far beyond Neptune's orbit - is an expected outcome of the solar system's primordial evolution within a stellar cluster. Recent models have shown that the process of early planetesimal capture within the trans-Neptunian region may have been sufficiently high for the cumulative mass of the Cloud to approach several Earth masses. In light of this, here we examine the dynamical evolution of the IOC, driven by its own self-gravity. We show that the collective gravitational potential of the IOC is adequately approximated by the Miyamoto-Nagai model, and use a semi-analytic framework to demonstrate that the resulting secular oscillations are akin to the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai resonance. We verify our results with direct $N$-body calculations, and examine the effects of IOC self-gravity on the long-term behavior of the solar system's minor bodies using a detailed simulation. Cumulatively, we find that while the modulation of perihelion distances and inclinations can occur within an observationally relevant range, the associated timescales vastly surpass the age of the sun, indicating that the influence of IOC self-gravity on the architecture of the solar system is negligible.

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroseismology offers a profound window into stellar interiors and has emerged as a pivotal technique in exoplanetary research. This study harnesses the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observations to reveal, for the first time, the asteroseismic oscillations of four exoplanet-hosting stars. Through meticulous analysis, we extracted their asteroseismic signatures, enabling the precise determination of stellar masses, radii, luminosities, and surface gravities. These parameters exhibit markedly reduced uncertainties compared to those derived from spectroscopic methods. Crucially, the exoplanets orbiting these stars were initially identified via radial velocity measurements. The refinement of host stellar masses necessitates a corresponding adjustment in planetary characteristics. Employing asteroseismology, we recalibrated the exoplanets' minimum masses and semi-major axes - a novel approach in the field. For instance, the exoplanet HD 5608 b's minimum mass, denoted as Msini, was ascertained to be 1.421 +/- 0.091 M_J through the integration of asteroseismic and radial velocity data. Similarly, two planets within the 7 CMa system yielded Msini values of 1.940 +/- 0.064 MJ and 0.912 +/- 0.067 M_J, respectively. Two planets in HD 33844 system presented Msini figures of 1.726 +/- 0.145 M_J and 1.541 +/- 0.182 M_J, while the HIP 67851 system's planets registered Msini at 1.243 +/- 0.139 M_J and a notably higher 5.387 +/- 0.699 M_J. This investigation extends beyond mere parameter refinement; it underscores the synergy between asteroseismology and exoplanetology, yielding unprecedented precision in system metrics. Focusing on quartet of K-type giants in advanced evolutionary phases, our work positions these systems as invaluable astrophysical laboratories, offering insights into the potential trajectory of our own solar system's fate.

          Blowin' in the non-isothermal wind: core-powered mass loss with hydrodynamic radiative transfer

 - **Abstract**
 The mass loss rates of planets undergoing core-powered escape are usually modeled using an isothermal Parker-type wind at the equilibrium temperature, $T_\mathrm{eq}$. However, the upper atmospheres of sub-Neptunes may not be isothermal if there are significant differences between the opacity to incident visible and outgoing infrared radiation. We model bolometrically-driven escape using aiolos, a hydrodynamic radiative-transfer code that incorporates double-gray opacities, to investigate the process's dependence on the visible-to-infrared opacity ratio, $\gamma$. For a value of $\gamma \approx 1$, we find that the resulting mass loss rates are well-approximated by a Parker-type wind with an isothermal temperature $T = T_\mathrm{eq}/2^{1/4}$. However, we show that over a range of physically plausible values of $\gamma$, the mass loss rates can vary by orders of magnitude, ranging from $10^{-5} \times$ the isothermal rate for low $\gamma$ to $10^5 \times$ the isothermal rate for high $\gamma$. The differences in mass loss rates are largest for small planet radii, while for large planet radii, mass loss rates become nearly independent of $\gamma$ and approach the isothermal approximation. We incorporate these opacity-dependent mass loss rates into a self-consistent planetary mass and energy evolution model and show that lower/higher $\gamma$ values lead to more/less hydrogen being retained after core-powered mass loss. In some cases, the choice of opacities determines whether or not a planet can retain a significant primordial hydrogen atmosphere. The dependence of escape rate on the opacity ratio may allow atmospheric escape observations to directly constrain a planet's opacities and therefore its atmospheric composition.

          Star formation in the high-extinction Planck cold clump PGCC G120.69+2.66

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the star formation occurring in the Planck Galactic cold clump PGCC 120.69+2.66. Near-infrared JHKs images and K-band spectroscopy obtained with NOTCam at the Nordic Optical Telescope complemented with archive data are used to study the stellar content. In addition, millimetre line CO and CS spectra were obtained with the Onsala 20 m telescope, and sub-millimetre continuum SCUBA archive data are used to characterise the host molecular cloud. We identify a molecular cloud core traced by CO and CS emission at a distance of 1.1 kpc. In the region studied, we identify 5 submm continuum cores. Embedded in and around these dense submm cores, we find 38 young stellar objects, classified as 9 Class I, 8 Class II, and 21 near-IR excess or variability sources, accompanied by bipolar nebulosities and signs of protostellar jets. Furthermore, a very bright and reddened source is found towards this molecular cloud core. Even though its location appears to suggest its association to the star formation region, its infrared spectral type is compatible with a red supergiant, hidden behind 36 mag of visual extinction.
