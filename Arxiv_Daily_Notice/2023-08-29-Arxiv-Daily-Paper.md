 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse explosions of massive stars leave behind neutron stars, with a known diversity that includes the "Central Compact Objects" (CCOs). Typified by the neutron star discovered near the centre of the Cas A supernova remnant (SNR), CCOs have been observed to shine only in X-rays. To address their supernova progenitors, we perform a systematic study of SNRs that contain a CCO and display X-ray emission from their shock-heated ejecta. We make use of X-ray data primarily using the Chandra X-ray observatory, complemented with XMM-Newton. This study uses a systematic approach to the analysis of each SNR aimed at addressing the supernova progenitor as well as the explosion properties (energy and ambient density). After fitting for the ejecta abundances estimated from a spatially resolved spectroscopic study, we compare the data to six nucleosynthesis models making predictions on supernova ejecta yields in core-collapse explosions. We find that the explosion models commonly used by the astrophysics community do not match the ejecta yields for any of the SNRs, suggesting additional physics, e.g. multi-dimensional explosion models or updated progenitor structures, are required. Overall we find low-mass ($\leq$25 solar masses) progenitors among the massive stars population and low-energy explosions ($<$10$^{51}$ ergs). We discuss degeneracies in our model fitting, particularly how altering the explosion energy affects the estimate of the progenitor mass. Our systematic study highlights the need for improving on the theoretical models for nucleosynthesis predictions as well as for sensitive, high-resolution spectroscopy observations to be acquired with next-generation X-ray missions.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma rays from HESS J1849$-$000, a middle-aged TeV pulsar wind nebula (PWN), are observed by the Tibet air shower array and the muon detector array. The detection significance of gamma rays reaches $4.0\, \sigma$ and $4.4\, \sigma$ levels above 25 TeV and 100 TeV, respectively, in units of Gaussian standard deviation $\sigma$. The energy spectrum measured between $40\, {\rm TeV} < E < 320\, {\rm TeV}$ for the first time is described with a simple power-law function of ${\rm d}N/{\rm d}E = (2.86 \pm 1.44) \times 10^{-16}(E/40\, {\rm TeV})^{-2.24 \pm 0.41}\, {\rm TeV}^{-1}\, {\rm cm}^{-2}\, {\rm s}^{-1}$. The gamma-ray energy spectrum from the sub-TeV ($E < 1\, {\rm TeV}$) to sub-PeV ($100\, {\rm TeV} < E < 1\, {\rm PeV}$) ranges including the results of previous studies can be modeled with the leptonic scenario, inverse Compton scattering by high-energy electrons accelerated by the PWN of PSR J1849$-$0001. On the other hand, the gamma-ray energy spectrum can also be modeled with the hadronic scenario in which gamma rays are generated from the decay of neutral pions produced by collisions between accelerated cosmic-ray protons and the ambient molecular cloud found in the gamma-ray emitting region. The cutoff energy of cosmic-ray protons $E_{\rm p\, cut}$, cut is estimated at ${\rm log}_{10}(E_{\rm p,\, cut}/{\rm TeV}) = 3.73^{+2.98}_{-0.66}$, suggesting that protons are accelerated up to the PeV energy range. Our study thus proposes that HESS J1849$-$000 should be further investigated as a new candidate for a Galactic PeV cosmic-ray accelerator, PeVatron.
#### HI in Molecular Clouds: Irradiation by FUV plus Cosmic Rays

 - **Abstract**
 We extend the analytic theory presented by Sternberg et al. 2014 and Bialy \& Sternberg (2016) for the production of atomic hydrogen (HI) via FUV photodissociation at the boundaries of dense interstellar molecular (H$_2$) clouds, to also include the effects of penetrating (low-energy) cosmic-rays for the growth of the total HI column densities. We compute the steady-state abundances of the HI and H$_2$ in one-dimensional gas slabs in which the FUV photodissociation rates are reduced by depth-dependent H$_2$ self-shielding and dust absorption, and in which the cosmic-ray ionization rates are either constant or reduced by transport effects. The solutions for the HI and H$_2$ density profiles and the integrated HI columns, depend primarily on the ratios $I_{\rm UV}/Rn$ and $\zeta/Rn$, where $I_{\rm UV}$ is the intensity of the photodissociating FUV field, $\zeta$ is the H$_2$ cosmic-ray ionization rate, $n$ is the hydrogen gas density, and $R$ is the dust-surface H$_2$ formation rate coefficient. We present computations for a wide range of FUV field strengths, cosmic-ray ionization rates, and dust-to-gas ratios. We develop analytic expressions for the growth of the HI column densities. For Galactic giant molecular clouds (GMCs) with multiphased (warm/cold) HI envelopes, the interior cosmic-ray zones will dominate the production of the HI only if $\zeta \gtrsim 4.5\times 10^{-16} \times (M_{\rm GMC}/10^6 \ M_{\odot})^{-1/2}$~s$^{-1}$, where $M_{\rm GMC}$ is the GMC mass, and including attenuation of the cosmic-ray fluxes. For most Galactic GMCs and conditions, FUV photodissociation dominates over cosmic-ray ionization for the production of the HI column densities. Furthermore, the cosmic-rays do not affect the HI-to-H$_2$ transition points.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar lines observed toward stellar targets change slowly over long timescales, mainly due to the proper motion of the background target relative to the intervening clouds. On longer timescales, the cloud's slowly changing physical and chemical conditions can also cause variation. We searched for systematic variations in the absorption profiles of the diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) and interstellar atomic and molecular lines by comparing the high-quality data set from the ESO diffuse interstellar bands extensive exploration survey (EDIBLES) to older archival observations, bridging typical timescales of 10 years with a maximum timescale of 22 years. We found good archival observations for 64 EDIBLES targets. Our analysis focused on 31 DIBs, 7 atomic, and 5 molecular lines. We considered various systematic effects and applied a robust Bayesian test to establish which absorption features could display significant variations. While systematic effects greatly complicate our search, we find evidence for variations in the profiles of the $\lambda\lambda$4727 and 5780 DIBs in a few sightlines. Toward HD~167264, we find a new \ion{Ca}{i} cloud component that appears and becomes stronger after 2008. The same sightline furthermore displays marginal but systematic changes in the column densities of the atomic lines originating from the leading cloud component in the sightline. Similar variations are seen toward HD~147933. Our high-quality spectroscopic observations and archival data show that it is possible to probe interstellar time variations on time scales of typically a decade. Even though systematic uncertainties, as well as the generally somewhat lower quality of older data, complicate matters, we can conclude that time variations can be made visible, both in atomic lines and DIB profiles for a few targets, but that generally, these features are stable along many lines of sight.
#### JWST Observations of the Extraordinary GRB 221009A Reveal an Ordinary  Supernova Without Signs of $r$-Process Enrichment in a Low-Metallicity Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 Identifying the astrophysical sites of the $r$-process, one of the primary mechanisms by which heavy elements are formed, is a key goal of modern astrophysics. The discovery of the brightest gamma-ray burst of all time, GRB 221009A, at a relatively nearby redshift, presented the first opportunity to spectroscopically test the idea that $r$-process elements are produced following the collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars. Here we present spectroscopic and photometric $\textit{James Webb Space Telescope}$ (JWST) observations of GRB 221009A obtained $+168$ and $+170$ rest-frame days after the initial gamma-ray trigger, and demonstrate they are well-described by a supernova (SN) and power-law afterglow, with no evidence for an additional component from $r$-process emission, and that the SN component strongly resembles the near-infrared spectra of previous SNe, including SN 1998bw. We further find that the SN associated with GRB 221009A is slightly fainter than the expected brightness of SN 1998bw at this phase, concluding that the SN is therefore not an unusual GRB-SN. We infer a nickel mass of $\approx0.09$ M$_{\odot}$, consistent with the lack of an obvious SN detection in the early-time data. We find that the host galaxy of GRB 221009A has a very low metallicity of $\approx0.12$ Z$_{\odot}$ and our resolved host spectrum shows that GRB 221009A occurred in a unique environment in its host characterized by strong H$_2$ emission lines consistent with recent star formation, which may hint at environmental factors being responsible for its extreme energetics.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the APOGEE survey we conducted a search for carbon-deficient red giants (CDGs). We found 103 new CDGs, increasing the number in the literature by more than a factor of 3. CDGs are very rare, representing $0.03$~per cent of giants. They appear as an extended tail off the normal carbon distribution. We show that they are found in all components of the Galaxy, contrary to previous findings. The location of CDGs in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD) shows that they are primarily intermediate-mass stars ($2-4~\rm{M}_{\odot}$). Their extended distribution may indicate that CDGs can also sometimes have $M < 2.0~\rm{M}_{\odot}$. We attempted to identify the evolutionary phases of the CDGs using stellar model tracks. We found that the bulk of the CDGs are likely in the subgiant branch or red clump phase, whereas other CDGs may be in the red giant branch or early asymptotic giant branch phases. Degeneracy in the HRD makes exact identification difficult. We examined their C, N, and O compositions and confirmed previous studies showing that the envelope material has undergone extensive hydrogen burning through the CN(O) cycle. The new-CDGs have [C+N+O/Fe] that generally sum to zero, indicating that they started with scaled-solar composition. However, the previously known-CDGs generally have [C+N+O/Fe$] > 0.0$, indicating that some He-burning products were added to their envelopes. As to the site(s) in which this originally occurred, we do not find a convincing solution.
#### Identification of the simplest sugar-like molecule glycolaldehyde  towards the hot molecular core G358.93-0.03 MM1

 - **Abstract**
 Glycolaldehyde (CH$_{2}$OHCHO) is the simplest monosaccharide sugar in the interstellar medium, and it is directly involved in the origin of life via the 'RNA world' hypothesis. We present the first detection of glycolaldehyde (CH$_{2}$OHCHO) towards the hot molecular core G358.93-0.03 MM1 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). The calculated column density of CH$_{2}$OHCHO towards G358.93-0.03 MM1 is (1.52$\pm$0.9)$\times$10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ with an excitation temperature of 300$\pm$68.5 K. The derived fractional abundance of CH$_{2}$OHCHO with respect to H$_{2}$ is (4.90$\pm$2.92)$\times$10$^{-9}$, which is consistent with that estimated by existing two-phase warm-up chemical models. We discuss the possible formation pathways of CH$_{2}$OHCHO within the context of hot molecular cores and hot corinos and find that CH$_{2}$OHCHO is likely formed via the reactions of radical HCO and radical CH$_{2}$OH on the grain surface of G358.93-0.03 MM1.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87* and Sgr A* strongly suggests the presence of supermassive black hole at their respective cores. In this work, we use the semi-analytic Radiatively Inefficient Accretion Flows (RIAF) model to investigate the resulting images of Joshi-Malafarina-Narayan (JMN-1) naked singularity and the Schwarzschild BH. We aim at choosing the JMN-1 naked singularity model and compare the synchrotron images with the Schwarzschild solution to search any distinct features which can distinguish the two objects and find alternative to the black hole solution. We perform general relativistic ray-tracing and radiative transfer simulations using Brahma code to generate synchrotron emission images utilising thermal distribution function for emissivity and absorptivity. We investigate effects in the images by varying inclination angle, disk width and frequency. The shadow images simulated by the JMN-1 model closely resemble those generated by the Schwarzschild black hole. When we compare these images, we find that the disparities between them are minimal. We conduct simulations using various plasma parameters, but the resulting images remain largely consistent for both scenarios. This similarity is evident in the horizontal cross-sectional brightness profiles of the two instances. Notably, the JMN-1 model exhibits slightly higher intensity in comparison to the Schwarzschild black hole. We conclude that JMN-1 presents itself as a viable substitute for the black hole scenario. This conclusion is not solely grounded in the fact that they are indistinguishable from their respective shadow observations, but also in the consideration that JMN-1 emerges as an end state of a continual gravitational collapse. This paradigm not only allows for constraints on spacetime but also provides a good probe for the nature of the central compact object.
#### The puzzling properties of the MACS1149-JD1 galaxy at z=9.11

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze new JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec data on the redshift 9.11 galaxy MACS1149-JD1. Our NIRCam imaging data reveal that JD1 comprises three spatially distinct components. Our spectroscopic data indicate that JD1 appears dust-free but is already enriched, $12 + \log {\rm (O/H) } = 7.875^{+0.042}_{-0.045}$. We also find that the Carbon and Neon abundances in JD1 are below the solar abundance ratio. Particularly the Carbon under-abundance is suggestive of recent star formation where Type~II supernovae have already enriched the ISM in Oxygen but intermediate mass stars have not yet enriched the ISM in Carbon. A recent burst of star formation is also revealed by the star formation history derived from NIRCam photometry. Our data do not reveal the presence of a significant amount of old populations, resulting in a factor of $\sim7\times$ smaller stellar mass than previous estimates. Thus, our data support the view that JD1 is a young object.
