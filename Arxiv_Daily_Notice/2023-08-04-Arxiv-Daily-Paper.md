 - **Abstract**
 We present a comparison of the Milky Way's star formation rate (SFR) surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) obtained with two independent state-of-the-art observational methods. The first method infers $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ from the observations of the dust thermal emission from interstellar dust grains in far infrared wavelengths registered in the Herschel Infrared Galactic Plane Survey (Hi-GAL), as presented in Elia et al. (2022). The second method obtains $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ by modeling the current population of O-, B-, and A-type stars in a 6 kpc $\times$ 6 kpc area around the Sun, as presented in Zari et al. (2023). We found an agreement between the two methods within a factor of two for the mean SFRs and the SFR surface density profiles. Given the broad differences between the observational techniques and the independent assumptions in the methods to compute the SFRs, this agreement constitutes a significant advance in our understanding of the star formation of our Galaxy and implies that the local SFR has been roughly constant over the past 10 Myr.

 - **Abstract**
 The dominant formation mechanism of brown dwarfs and planetary mass objects in star-forming regions is presently uncertain. Do they form like stars, via the collapse and fragmentation of cores in Giant Molecular clouds, or do they form like planets in the discs around stars and are ejected via dynamical interactions? In this paper, we quantify the spatial distribution of substellar objects in NGC1333, in particular focusing on planetary-mass objects that have been the target of recent deep imaging observations. We find that these objects have a spatial distribution that is indistinguishable from the stars, and more massive brown dwarfs. We also analyse N-body simulations and find that a population of ejected planets would have a significantly different spatial and kinematic distribution to stars, and brown dwarfs that also formed through gravitational collapse and fragmentation. We therefore conclude that the low-mass substellar objects in NGC1333 formed more like stars than planets, although we predict that a population of hitherto undetected ejected planetary mass objects may be lurking in this, and other star-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) Molecular lines are commonly detected towards protostellar sources. However, to get a better understanding of the chemistry of these sources we need unbiased molecular surveys over a wide frequency range for as many sources as possible to shed light on the origin of this chemistry, particularly any influence from the external environment. We present results from the PILS-Cygnus survey of ten intermediate- to high-mass protostellar sources in the nearby Cygnus-X complex, through high angular resolution interferometric observations over a wide frequency range. Using the Submillimeter Array (SMA), a spectral line survey of ten sources was performed in the frequency range 329-361 GHz, with an angular resolution of $\sim$1\farcs5, ($\sim$2000 AU, source distance of 1.3 kpc). Spectral modelling was performed to identify molecular emission and determine column densities and excitation temperatures for each source. We detect CH$_3$OH towards nine of the ten sources, CH$_3$OCH$_3$ and CH$_3$OCHO towards three sources, and CH$_3$CN towards four sources. Towards five sources the chemistry is spatially differentiated (different species peak at different positions and are offset from the peak continuum emission). The chemical properties of each source do not correlate with their position in the Cygnus-X complex, nor do the distance or direction to the nearest OB associations. However, the five sources located in the DR21 filament do appear to show less line emission compared to the five sources outside the filament. This work shows how important wide frequency coverage observations are combined with high angular resolution observations for studying the protostellar environment. Based on the ten sources observed here, the external environment appears to only play a minor role in setting the chemical environment on these small scales ($<$ 2000 AU).
#### Cloud reflection modelling for impact flashes on Jupiter: A new  constraint on the bulk properties of the impact objects

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate optical characteristics of flashes caused by impacting meter- to decameter-sized outer solar system objects on Jupiter and contributions of reflected light from surface clouds at visible wavelengths to estimate more accurate bulk parameters such as the luminous energy of the flash, the kinetic energy, the mass, and the size of the impact object. Based on the results of recent reflectivity studies of the Jovian surface, we develop a cloud reflection model that calculates the contribution of the reflected light relative to that directly from the flash. We compare the apparent luminous energy of the previously reported flashes with the expected cloud reflection contributions to obtain their revised bulk parameters. We found that the cloud reflection contributions can be up to 200% of the flux directly from the flash and thus can be the most significant uncertainty in the measurement of the bulk parameters. The reflection contributions strongly depend on wavelength. With our cloud reflection correction, the revised bulk parameters of the previously reported flashes are obtained. Our cloud reflection correction provides a better understanding of the properties of impacting objects on Jupiter and is crucial for ongoing detailed investigations using high-sensitivity and multi-wavelength observation systems such as PONCOTS. It will also be useful for understanding other optical transients in Jupiter's upper atmosphere, such as the recently discovered sprite-like events.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive investigation of HI (super)clouds, molecular clouds (MCs), and star formation in the Carina spiral arm of the outer Galaxy. Utilizing HI4PI and CfA CO survey data, we identify HI clouds and MCs based on the ($l$, ${v_\mathrm{LSR}}$) locations of the Carina arm. We analyzed 26 HI clouds and 48 MCs. Most of the identified HI clouds are superclouds, with masses exceeding $10^6~{\mathrm{M_\odot}}$. We find that 15 of these superclouds have associated MC(s) with ${M_\mathrm{HI}} \gtrsim 10^6~{\mathrm{M_\odot}}$ and ${\Sigma_\mathrm{HI+H_2}} \gtrsim$ 50 ${\mathrm{M_\odot}} \rm pc^{-2}$. Our virial equilibrium analysis suggests that these CO-bright HI clouds are gravitationally bound or marginally bound. We report an anti-correlation between molecular mass fractions and Galactocentric distances, and a correlation with total gas surface densities. Nine CO-bright HI superclouds are associated with HII regions, indicating ongoing star formation. We confirm the regular spacing of HI superclouds along the spiral arm, which is likely due to some underlying physical process, such as gravitational instabilities. We observe a strong spatial correlation between HII regions and MCs, with some offsets between MCs and local HI column density peaks. Our study reveals that in the context of HI superclouds, the star formation rate surface density is independent of HI and total gas surface densities but positively correlates with molecular gas surface density. This finding is consistent with both extragalactic studies of the resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and local giant molecular clouds study of Lada et al. (2013), emphasizing the crucial role of molecular gas in regulating star formation processes.
#### Turbulence measurements in the neutral ISM from Hi-21 cm  emission-absorption spectra

 - **Abstract**
 We study the correlation between the non-thermal velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm nth}$) and the length-scale (L) in the neutral interstellar medium (ISM) using a large number of Hi gas components taken from various published Hi surveys and previous Hi studies. We notice that above the length-scale ($L$) of 0.40 pc, there is a power-law relationship between $\sigma_{\rm nth}$ and $L$. However, below 0.40 pc, there is a break in the power-law, where $\sigma_{\rm nth}$ is not significantly correlated with $L$. It has been observed from the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method that for the dataset of $L > 0.40$ pc, the most probable values of intensity ($A$) and power-law index ($p$) are 1.14 and 0.55 respectively. Result of $p$ suggests that the power-law is steeper than the standard Kolmogorov law of turbulence. This is due to the dominance of clouds in the cold neutral medium. This is even more clear when we separate the clouds into two categories: one for $L$ is > 0.40 pc and the kinetic temperature ($T_k$ ) is < 250 K, which are in the cold neutral medium (CNM) and for other one where L is > 0.40 pc and T k is between 250 K and 5000 K, which are in the thermally unstable phase (UNM). Most probable values of $A$ and $p$ are 1.14 and 0.67 respectively in the CNM phase and 1.01 and 0.52 respectively in the UNM phase. A greater number of data points is effective for the UNM phase in constructing a more accurate estimate of $A$ and $p$, since most of the clouds in the UNM phase lie below 500 K. However, from the value of $p$ in the CNM phase, it appears that there is a significant difference from the Kolmogorov scaling, which can be attributed to a shock-dominated medium.
#### Interacting supernovae from wide massive binary systems

 - **Abstract**
 Many supernovae (SNe) imply an interaction of the SN ejecta with matter (CSM) surrounding the progenitor star. This suggests that many massive stars may undergo various degrees of envelope stripping shortly before exploding, and produce a considerable diversity in their pre-explosion CSM properties. We explore a generic set of ~100 detailed massive binary evolution models to characterize the amount of envelope stripping and the expected CSM configurations. Our binary models were computed with the MESA stellar evolution code, considering an initial primary star mass of 12.6 Msun, and focus on initial orbital periods above 500 d. We compute these models up to the time of the primary's iron core collapse. We find that Roche lobe overflow often leads to incomplete stripping of the mass donor, resulting in a large variety of pre-SN envelope masses. Many of our models' red supergiant (RSG) donors undergo core collapse during Roche lobe overflow, with mass transfer and thus system mass loss rates of up to 0.01 Msun/yr at that time. The corresponding CSM densities are similar to those inferred for Type IIn SNe like 1998S. In other cases, the mass transfer turns unstable, leading to a common envelope phase at such late time that the mass donor explodes before the common envelope is fully ejected or the system has merged. We argue that this may cause significant pre-SN variability, as for example in SN 2020tlf. Other models suggest a common envelope ejection just centuries before core collapse, which may lead to the strongest interactions, as in superluminous Type IIn SNe like 1994W, or 2006gy. Wide massive binaries offer a natural framework to understand a broad range of hydrogen-rich interacting SNe. On the other hand, the flash features observed in many Type IIP SNe, like in SN 2013fs, may indicate that RSGs are more extended than currently assumed.
#### Observational Implications of OJ 287's Predicted 2022 Disk Impact in the  Black Hole Binary Model

 - **Abstract**
 We present a summary of the results of the OJ 287 observational campaign, which was carried out during the 2021/2022 observational season. This season is special in the binary model because the major axis of the precessing binary happens to lie almost exactly in the plane of the accretion disc of the primary. This leads to pairs of almost identical impacts between the secondary black hole and the accretion disk in 2005 and 2022. In 2005, a special flare called "blue flash" was observed 35 days after the disk impact, which should have also been verifiable in 2022. We did observe a similar flash and were able to obtain more details of its properties. We describe this in the framework of expanding cloud models. In addition, we were able to identify the flare arising exactly at the time of the disc crossing from its photo-polarimetric and gamma-ray properties. This is an important identification, as it directly confirms the orbit model. Moreover, we saw a huge flare that lasted only one day. We may understand this as the lighting up of the jet of the secondary black hole when its Roche lobe is suddenly flooded by the gas from the primary disk. Therefore, this may be the first time we directly observed the secondary black hole in the OJ 287 binary system.
#### HST-1 as a Window to the Energetics of the Jet Spine of M87

 - **Abstract**
 A new interpretation of the optical knot in the jet of M87, HST-1, is presented. High sensitivity 22 GHz Very Large Array images locate HST-1 to within 6 mas of the jet axis immediately upstream. 1.7 GHz Very Long Baseline Array images of a bright flare in 2005 indicates that the preponderance of emission in the early stages originates in an elongated region that is tilted $12.5^{\circ}$ from the jet axis. The superluminal motion, shape, location and the large jet-aligned optical/UV polarization suggest an identification with the putative relativistic spine of the jet. As such, energy flux estimates for HST-1, $\sim 870$ mas from the nucleus, published in 2006 indicate that the central engine injected $Q_{\rm{spine}}\approx 2.5 \times 10^{41}\rm{ergs/s}$ into the base of the spine $\sim 200$ years earler. Furthermore, previous studies reveal a tubular protonic jet on sub-mas scales that envelopes a low luminosity core, presumably the faint spine base. It was estimated that the central engine injected $Q_{\rm{tubular\,jet}}\approx 6.1\times 10^{41}\rm{ergs/s}$ $\sim 1.5$ years earlier. If one component of the jet is inherently more powerful, a firm constraint on total jet power in the recent past exists. If the emitted jet is inherently dominated by the spine (tubular jet) then the total bilaterally symmetric jet power emitted from the central engine was $<4Q_{\rm{spine}}\approx 1.0 \times 10^{42}\rm{ergs/s}$ ($< 4Q_{\rm{tubular\,jet}}\approx 2.4\times 10^{42}\rm{ergs/s}$) $\sim 200$ ($\sim 1.5$) years earlier. Assuming a nearly constant central engine injected jet power for $\sim 200$ years indicates a total jet power of $\lesssim 2\times 10^{42}$ ergs/s in epochs of modern observation or $\lesssim 3.5\%$ jet production efficiency for an accretion rate of 0.001$M_{\odot}$/yr.
