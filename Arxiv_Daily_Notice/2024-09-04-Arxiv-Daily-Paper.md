 - **Abstract**
 Extended Ly$\alpha$ emission is routinely found around single quasars (QSO) across cosmic time. However, few studies have investigated how such emission changes in fields with physically associated QSO pairs, which should reside in dense environments and are predicted to be linked through intergalactic filaments. We present VLT/MUSE snapshot observations (45 min./source) to unveil extended Ly$\alpha$ emission on scales of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) around the largest sample of physically associated QSO pairs to date, encompassing 8 pairs (14 observed QSOs) at $z$~3 with $i$-band magnitude between 18 and 22.75. The pairs are either at close (~50-100 kpc, 5 pairs) or wide (~450-500 kpc, 3 pairs) separation with velocity differences of $\Delta$v < 2000 km s$^{-1}$. We detect extended emission around 12 of the 14 targeted QSOs and investigate the luminosity, size, kinematics and morphology of these Ly$\alpha$ nebulae. On average, they span 90 kpc and are 2.8 $\times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ bright. Irrespective of the QSOs' projected distance, the nebulae often (~45 %) extend toward the other QSO in the pair, leading to asymmetric emission whose flux-weighted centroid is at an offset position from any QSO location. We show that large nebulae are preferentially aligned with the large-scale structure as traced by the two QSOs, and conclude that the cool gas (10$^4$ K) in the CGM traces well the direction of cosmic web filaments. Additionally, the radial profile of the Ly$\alpha$ surface brightness around QSO pairs can be described by a power law with a shallower slope (~$-1.6$) with respect to single QSOs (~$-2$), indicative of increased CGM densities out to large radii and/or enhanced contribution from the intergalactic medium (IGM). The sample presented in this study contains excellent targets for ultra-deep observations to directly study filamentary IGM structures in emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Characterization of search selection effects comprises a core element of gravitational-wave data analysis. Knowledge of selection effects is needed to predict observational prospects for future surveys and is essential in the statistical inference of astrophysical source populations from observed catalogs of compact binary mergers. Although gravitational-wave selection functions can be directly measured via injection campaigns -- the insertion and attempted recovery of simulated signals added to real instrumental data -- such efforts are computationally expensive. Moreover, the inability to interpolate between discrete injections limits the ability to which we can study narrow or discontinuous features in the compact binary population. For this reason, there is a growing need for alternative representations of gravitational-wave selection functions that are computationally cheap to evaluate and can be computed across a continuous range of compact binary parameters. In this paper, we describe one such representation. Using pipeline injections performed during Advanced LIGO & Advanced Virgo's third observing run (O3), we train a neural network emulator for $P(\mathrm{det}|\theta)$, the probability that given a compact binary with parameters is successfully detected, averaged over the course of O3. The emulator captures the dependence of $P(\mathrm{det}|\theta)$ on binary masses, spins, distance, sky position, and orbital orientation, and it is valid for compact binaries with components masses between $1$--$100\,M_\odot$. We test the emulator's ability to produce accurate distributions of detectable events, and demonstrate its use in hierarchical inference of the binary black hole population.

 - **Abstract**
 Here we critically examine the geophysical and geochemical properties of the Moon in order to identify the extent to which dynamical scenarios satisfy these observations. New joint inversions of existing lunar geophysical data (mean mass, moment of inertia, and tidal response) assuming a laterally- and vertically homogeneous lunar mantle show that, in all cases, a core with a radius of 300$\pm$20 km ($\sim$0.8 to 1.5 % the mass of the Moon) is required. However, an Earth-like Mg# (0.89) in the lunar mantle results in core densities (7800$\pm$100 kg/m$^3$) consistent with that of Fe-Ni alloy, whereas FeO-rich compositions (Mg# = 0.80--0.84) require lower densities (6100$\pm$800 kg/m$^3$). Geochemically, we use new data on mare basalts to reassess the bulk composition of the Moon for 70 elements, and show that the lunar core likely formed near 5 GPa, 2100 K and $\sim$1 log unit below the iron-wüstite buffer. Moreover, the Moon is depleted relative to the Earth's mantle in elements with volatilities higher than that of Li, with this volatile loss likely having occurred at low temperatures (1400$\pm$100 K), consistent with mass-dependent stable isotope fractionation of moderately volatile elements (e.g., Zn, K, Rb). The identical nucleosynthetic (O, Cr, Ti) and radiogenic (W) isotope compositions of the lunar and terrestrial mantles, strongly suggest the two bodies were made from the same material, rather than from an Earth-like impactor. Rb-Sr in FANs and Lu-Hf and Pb-Pb zircon ages point Moon formation close to $\sim$4500 Ma. Taken together, there is no unambiguous geochemical or isotopic evidence for the role of an impactor in the formation of the Moon, implying perfect equilibration between the proto-Earth and Moon-forming material or alternative scenarios for its genesis.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the cold gas phase in a low metallicity starburst generated in a high-resolution hydrodynamical simulation of a gas-rich dwarf galaxy merger as part of the GRIFFIN project. The simulations resolve (4 M$_\odot$ gas phase mass resolution, $\sim$ 0.1 pc spatial resolution) the multi-phase interstellar medium with a non-equilibrium chemical heating/cooling network at temperatures below $10^4$ K. Massive stars are sampled individually and interact with the ISM through the formation of HII regions and supernova explosions. In the extended starburst phase, the ISM is dominated by cold ($T_\mathrm{gas} < 300$ K) filamentary clouds with self-similar internal structures. The clouds have masses of $10^{2.6}$ - $10^{5.6}$ M$_\odot$ with a power law mass function, $dN/dM \propto M^\alpha$ with $\alpha = -1.78 (\pm 0.08)$. They also follow the Larson relations, in good agreement with observations. We trace the lifecycle of the cold clouds and find that they follow an exponential lifetime distribution and an e-folding time of $\sim$ 3.5 Myr. Clouds with peak masses below $10^4$ M$_\odot$ follow a power law relation with their average lifetime $\tau_\mathrm{life} \propto M^{0.3}_\mathrm{max}$ which flattens out for higher cloud masses at $ < 10$ Myr. A similar relation exists between cloud size at peak mass and lifetime. This simulation of the evolution of a realistic galactic cold cloud population supports the rapid formation and disruption of star-forming clouds by stellar radiation and supernovae on a timescale less than 10 Myr.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic variance on the star formation history may lead to bias to the merger rate density estimation of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers by the compact binary population synthesis. In this paper, we take the advantage of the large boxsize of the Millennium Simulation combined with the semi-analytic galaxy formation model GABE, and the parameterized population binary star evolution (BSE) model to examine how much effect will the cosmic variance introduce on the estimation of merger rate density of BNS mergers. We find that for sub-box size of $100\rm Mpc$ and $200\rm Mpc$, the variance of merger rate density $\sigma_{\rm R}/\rm R$ at different redshift is about $23\%-35\%$ and $13\%-20\%$ respectively. On one hand, as for the variance of the detection rate on BNS mergers with current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detector network, this value is very small $\lesssim 10\%$, which indicates ignoring the cosmic variance is reasonable for estimating the merger rate density from current LVK observation. On the other hand, with next-generation gravitational wave detectors, it is possible to localize BNS mergers within sub-boxes possessing length of $\rm 40 Mpc$ for source redshift $z_{s}<0.2$. In such a small box, the cosmic variance of the merger rate density is significant, i.e., the value of $\sigma_{\rm R}/\rm R$ is about $\sim 55\%$. This hints that estimating the merger rate density of BNS in different sky areas may provide useful information on the cosmic variance.

 - **Abstract**
 The periodic coronal rain and in-phase radiative intensity pulsations have been observed in multiple wavelengths in recent years. However, due to the lack of three-dimensional coronal magnetic fields and thermodynamic data in observations, it remains challenging to quantify the coronal heating rate that drives the mass cycles. In this work, based on the MURaM code, we conduct a three-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulation spanning from the convective zone to the corona, where the solar atmosphere is heated self-consistently through dissipation resulting from magneto-convection. For the first time, we model the periodic coronal rain in an active region. With a high spatial resolution, the simulation well resembles the observational features across different extreme ultraviolet wavelengths. These include the realistic interweaving coronal loops, periodic coronal rain and periodic intensity pulsations, with two periods of 3.0~h and 3.7~h identified within one loop system. Moreover, the simulation allows for a detailed three-dimensional depiction of coronal rain on small scales, revealing adjacent shower-like rain clumps $\sim500$~km in width and showcasing their multi-thermal internal structures. We further reveal that these periodic variations essentially reflect the cyclic energy evolution of the coronal loop under thermal non-equilibrium state. Importantly, as the driver of the mass circulation, the self-consistent coronal heating rate is considerably complex in time and space, with hour-level variations in one order of magnitude, minute-level bursts, and varying asymmetry reaching ten times between footpoints. This provides an instructive template for the ad hoc heating function, and further enhances our understanding of the coronal heating process.

 - **Abstract**
 How and where the first generation of inner solar system planetesimals formed remains poorly understood. Potential formation regions are the silicate condensation line and water-snowline of the solar protoplanetary disk. Whether the chemical compositions of these planetesimals align with accretion at the silicate condensation line (water-free and reduced) or water-snowline (water-bearing and oxidized) is, however, unknown. Here we use Fe/Ni and Fe/Co ratios of magmatic iron meteorites to quantify the oxidation states of the earliest planetesimals associated with non-carbonaceous (NC) and carbonaceous (CC) reservoirs, representing the inner and outer solar system, respectively. Our results show that the earliest NC planetesimals contained substantial amounts of oxidized Fe in their mantles (3-19 wt% FeO). In turn, we argue that this required the accretion of water-bearing materials into these NC planetesimals. The presence of substantial quantities of moderately and highly volatile elements in their parent cores is also inconsistent with their accretion at the silicate condensation line and favors instead their formation at or beyond the water-snowline. Similar oxidation states in the early-formed parent bodies of NC iron meteorites and those of NC achondrites and chondrites with diverse accretion ages suggests that the formation of oxidized planetesimals from water-bearing materials was widespread in the early history of the inner solar system.

 - **Abstract**
 Most exoplanets with a few Earth radii are more inflated than bare-rock planets with the same mass, indicating a substantial volatile amount. Neither the origin of the volatiles nor the planet's bulk composition can be constrained from the mass-radius relation alone, and the spectral characterization of their atmospheres is needed to solve this degeneracy. Previous studies showed that chemical interaction between accreted volatile and possible molten rocky surface (i.e., magma ocean) can greatly affects the atmospheric composition. However, a variety in the atmospheric compositions of such planets with different properties remains elusive. In this work, we examine the dependence of atmospheric H, O, and C on planetary parameters (atmospheric thickness, planetary mass, equilibrium temperature, and magma properties such as redox state) assuming nebula gas accretion on an Earth-like core, using an atmosphere-magma chemical equilibrium model. Consistent with previous work, we show that atmospheric $\rm H_{2}O$ fraction on a fully molten rocky interior with an Earth-like redox state is on the order of $10^{-2}$-$10^{-1}$ regardless of other planetary parameters. Despite the solubility difference between H- and C-bearing species, C/H increases only a few times above the nebula value except for atmospheric pressure $\lesssim$1000 bar and $\rm H_{2}O$ fraction $\gtrsim$10\%. This results in a negative O/H-C/O trend and depleted C/O below one-tenth of the nebula gas value under an oxidized atmosphere, which could provide a piece of evidence of rocky interior and endogenic water. We also highlight the importance of constraints on the high-pressure material properties for interpreting the magma-atmospheric interaction of inflated planets.

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) Together with gravity, turbulence, and stellar feedback, magnetic fields (B-fields) are thought to play a critical role in the evolution of molecular clouds and star formation processes. We aim to map the morphology and measure the strength of B-fields of the nearby molecular cloud, rho Ophiuchus-A ($\rho$ Oph-A), and then to understand the role of B-fields in regulating star formation and shaping the cloud. We have analyzed the far-infrared (FIR) polarization of thermal dust emission observed by SOFIA/HAWC$+$ at 89 and 154 $\mu$m toward the densest part of $\rho$ Oph-A, which is irradiated by the nearby B3/4 star, Oph-S1. The cloud exhibits well-ordered B-fields with magnetic orientations mainly perpendicular to the ridge of the cloud toward the densest region and B-field strengths are in the range of 0.2-2.5 mG, using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. The B-fields are strongest at the densest part of the cloud, which is associated with the starless core SM1, and decreases toward the outskirts of the cloud. By calculating the map of the mass-to-flux ratio, Alfvén Mach number, and plasma $\beta$ parameter in $\rho$ Oph-A, we find that the cloud is predominantly magnetically sub-critical, sub-Alfvénic, which implies that the cloud is supported by strong B-fields that dominate over gravity, turbulence, and thermal gas energy. Measured B-field strengths at two densest subregions using other methods that account for the compressible mode are relatively lower than that measured with the DCF method but do not significantly change our conclusions on the roles of B-fields relative to gravity and turbulence on star formation. A virial analysis suggests that the cloud is gravitationally unbound. We find that B-fields are sufficiently strong to support the cloud against radiative feedback and to regulate the shape of the cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation in the central molecular zone (CMZ) is suppressed with respect to that of the Galactic disk, and this is likely related to its high turbulent environment. This turbulence impedes the potential detection of prestellar cores. We present the temperature, density, and spatial structure of the CMZ molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027, which has been proposed to host a prestellar cluster in the Sgr B2 region. We analysed multiple HC$_{3}$N rotational transitions that were observed with the IRAM 30m, APEX, Yebes 40m, and GBT radio telescopes, together with SMA+APEX spatially resolved maps. The spectral shape of HC$_{3}$N lines shows three velocity components: a broad component with a line width of 23 km s$^{-1}$ (C1), and two narrow components with line widths of 7.2 and 8.8 km s$^{-1}$ (C2 and C3). This suggests that a fraction of the molecular gas in this cloud is undergoing turbulence dissipation. From a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis we have found H$_{2}$ densities of 2$\times$10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, 5$\times$10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, and 4$\times$10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$ and kinetic temperatures of 140 K, 30 K, and 80 K for C1, C2, and C3, respectively. The spatially resolved maps confirm that the colder and high-density condensations C2 and C3, which peak in the 70-85 km s$^{-1}$ velocity range, are embedded in a more diffuse and warmer gas (C1). The larger-scale structure of the Sgr B2 region shows a hole at 40-50 km s$^{-1}$ that is likely due to a small cloud that shocked the Sgr B2 region and is spatially related with a massive cloud at 60-80 km s$^{-1}$. We propose that the impacting small cloud sequentially triggered the formation of Sgr B2(M), (N), and (S) and the condensations in G+0.693-0.027 during its passage. Based on the analysis of the masses of the two condensations and on the virial parameters, C2 might expand, while C3 might further fragment or collapse.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar active regions (ARs) are often surrounded by dark large areas of reduced emission compared to the quiet Sun, observed at various wavelengths corresponding to chromosphere, transition region (TR) and corona, and known as Dark Halos (DHs). DHs have been insufficiently studied, and the mechanisms behind their darker emission remain unclear. This study aims to investigate for the first time the fine structure of a DH observed by the EUV High Resolution Imager (HRI$_{EUV}$) onboard the ESA's Solar Orbiter (SO) mission and its appearance in the TR. We utilized the extensive 1-hour dataset from SO on 19 March 2022, which includes high-resolution observations of NOAA 12967 and part of the surrounding DH. We analyzed the dynamics of the HRI$_{EUV}$ DH fine structure and its appearance in the HRI$_{Ly\alpha}$ image and the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) Ly$\beta$, C III, N VI, O VI and Ne VIII lines, which sample the TR in the logT (K) $\sim$ 4.0 - 5.8 range. This analysis was complemented with a simultaneous B$_{LOS}$ magnetogram taken by the High Resolution Telescope (HRT). We report the presence of a peculiar fine structure which is not observed in the quiet Sun, characterized by combined bright EUV bundles and dark regions, arranged and interconnected in such a way that they cannot be clearly separated. They form a spatial continuum extending approximately radially from the AR core, suggesting a deep connection between the DH and the AR. Additionally, we find that the bright EUV bundles are observed in all the SPICE TR lines and the HRI$_{Ly\alpha}$ band and present photospheric B$_{LOS}$ footprints in the HRT magnetogram. This spatial correlation indicates that the origin of the 174 Å DH may lie in the low atmosphere, i.e. photosphere/chromosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery and characterization of a transiting sub-Saturn exoplanet TOI-6651b using PARAS-2 spectroscopic observations. The host, TOI-6651 ($m_{V}\approx 10.2$), is a sub-giant, metal-rich G-type star with $[{\rm Fe/H}] = 0.225^{+0.044}_{-0.045}$, $T_{\rm eff} = 5940\pm110\ \mathrm{K}$, and $\log{g} = 4.087^{+0.035}_{-0.032}$. Joint fitting of the radial velocities from PARAS-2 spectrograph and transit photometric data from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) reveals a planetary mass of $61.0^{+7.6}_{-7.9}\ M_\oplus$ and radius of $5.09^{+0.27}_{-0.26}\ R_\oplus$, in a $5.056973^{+0.000016}_{-0.000018}$ day orbit with an eccentricity of $0.091^{+0.096}_{-0.062}$. TOI-6651b has a bulk density of $2.52^{+0.52}_{-0.44}\ \mathrm{g\ cm^{-3}}$, positioning it among the select few known dense sub-Saturns and making it notably the densest detected with TESS. TOI-6651b is consistent with the positive correlation between planet mass and the host star's metallicity. We find that a considerable portion $\approx$ 87% of the planet's mass consists of dense materials such as rock and iron in the core, while the remaining mass comprises a low-density envelope of H/He. TOI-6651b lies at the edge of the Neptunian desert, which will be crucial for understanding the factors shaping the desert boundaries. The existence of TOI-6651b challenges conventional planet formation theories and could be a result of merging events or significant atmospheric mass loss through tidal heating, highlighting the complex interplay of dynamical processes and atmospheric evolution in the formation of massive dense sub-Saturns.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the effect of time-dependent ice growth on dust grains on the opacity and hence on the dust temperature in a collapsing molecular cloud core, with the aim of quantifying the effect of the dust temperature variations on ice abundances as well as the evolution of the collapse. We employed a one-dimensional collapse model that self-consistently and time-dependently combines hydrodynamics with chemical and radiative transfer simulations. The dust opacity was updated on-the-fly based on the ice growth as a function of location in the core. The results of the fully dynamical model were compared against simulations assuming fixed ice thickness. We found that the ice thickness increases fast and reaches a saturation value of approximately 90 monolayers in the central core (volume density $\sim$$10^4\,\rm cm^{-3}$), and several tens of monolayers at a volume density of $\sim$$10^3\,\rm cm^{-3}$, after only a few $10^5\,\rm yr$ of evolution. The results thus exclude the adoption of thin ($\sim$10 monolayer) ices in molecular cloud simulations except at very short timescales. The differences in abundances and dust temperature between the fully dynamic simulation and those with fixed dust opacity are small; abundances change between the solutions generally within a factor of two. The assumptions on the dust opacity do have an effect on the collapse dynamics through the influence of the photoelectric effect on the gas temperature, and the simulations take a different time to reach a common central density. In conclusion, carrying out chemical simulations using a dust temperature corresponding to a fixed opacity seems to be a good approximation. Still, although at least in the present case its effect on the overall results is limited - as long as the grains are monodisperse - ice growth should be considered to obtain the most accurate representation of the collapse dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar jets are collimated plasma ejections along magnetic field lines observed in hot (EUV jets) and cool (chromospheric surges) temperature diagnostics. Their trigger mechanisms and the relationship between hot and cool jets are still not completely understood. We aim to investigate the generation of a sequence of active region solar jets and their evolution from the photospheric to the coronal heights. Using the synergy of high spatial and temporal resolution observations by the SST, along with the SDO, we analyze a sequence of solar jets originating in a mixed polarity region between the leading and following sunspots of an active region. We use a NFFF extrapolation technique for deriving the magnetic field topology of the active region. A mixed polarity region is formed over a long period (24 hours) with persistent magnetic flux emergence. This region has been observed as an arch filament system (AFS) in chromospheric SST observations. In this region, negative polarities surrounded by positive polarities create a fan-surface with a null point at a height of 6 Mm detected in the NFFF extrapolation. SST observations in H-beta spectral line reveal a large flux rope over the AFS and moving from the North to South, causing successive EUV and cool jets to move in the East-West direction and later towards the South along the long open loops. The high resolution SST observations (0.038 arcsec per pixel) resolve the dark area observed at the jet base and reveal the existence of an AFS with an extended cool jet which may be the result of a peeling-like mechanism of the AFS. Based on the combined analysis of SST and AIA observations along with extrapolated magnetic topology, it is suggested that the magnetic reconnection site may move southward by approximately 20 Mm until it reaches a region where the open magnetic field lines are oriented North-South.

 - **Abstract**
 Contamination from singly ionized iron emission is one of the greatest obstacles to determining the intensity of emission lines in the UV and optical wavelength ranges. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the FeII emission in the bright quasar RM 102, based on the most recent version of the CLOUDY software, with the goal of simultaneously reproducing UV and optical FeII emission. We employ a constant pressure model for the emitting clouds, instead of the customary constant density assumption. The allowed parameter range is broad, with metallicity up to 50 times the solar value and turbulent velocity up to 100 km s$^{-1}$ for a subset of models. We also consider geometrical effects that could enhance the visibility of the non-illuminated faces of the clouds, as well as additional mechanical heating. Our investigation reveals that the broad line region of RM 102 is characterized by highly metallic gas. The observed FeII features provide strong evidence for an inflow pattern geometry that favours the dark sides of clouds over isotropic emission. This study confirms the presence of chemically enriched gas in the broad line region of bright quasars, represented by RM 102, which is necessary to explain the strong FeII emission and its characteristic features. Additionally, we report that CLOUDY currently still lacks certain transitions in its atomic databases which prevents it from fully reproducing some observed FeII features in quasar spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is a distributed, sparse ground antenna array designed to detect the radio emission from highly inclined extensive air showers induced by ultra-high-energy particles in the atmosphere. We use CoREAS air-shower simulations to adapt an existing signal model of the radio emission of inclined showers to the 50-200 MHz frequency band GRAND is sensitive to. The model uses a parameterisation of the charge excess emission to isolate the geomagnetic component. By fitting a one-dimensional lateral distribution function to the geomagnetic energy fluence of a shower, we reconstruct its radiation energy. This work details the signal model and the intrinsic event reconstruction of our method, as well as the adaptations to the new frequency band. This work is part of the NUTRIG project.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the light curve time series data for more than 11.7 million variable sources published in the Gaia Data Release 3, the average magnitudes, colors, and variability parameters have been computed for 0.836 million Gaia CRF objects, which are mostly quasars and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). To mitigate the effects of occasional flukes in the data, robust statistical measures have been employed, namely, the median, median absolute deviation, and Spearman correlation. We find that the majority of the CRF sources have moderate amplitudes of variability in the Gaia $G$ band just below 0.1 mag. The heavy-tailed distribution of variability amplitudes (quantified as robust standard deviations) does not find a single analytical form, but is closer to Maxwell distribution with a scale of 0.078 mag. The majority of CRF sources have positive correlations between $G$ magnitude and $G_{\rm BP}-G_{\rm RP}$ colors, meaning that these quasars and AGNs become bluer when they are brighter. The variations in the BP and RP bands are also mostly positively correlated. Dependencies of all variability parameters with cosmological redshift are fairly flat for the more accurate estimates above redshift 0.7, while the median color shows strong systematic variations with redshift. Using a robust normalized score of magnitude deviations, a sample of 5000 most variable quasars is selected and published. The intersection of this sample with the ICRF3 catalog shows a much higher rate of strongly variable quasars (mostly, blazars) in ICRF3.

 - **Abstract**
 The GAia Map of the Brightness Of the Natural Sky (GAMBONS) is a model to map the natural night brightness of the sky in cloudless and moonless nights. It computes the star radiance from the photometric data in Gaia and Hipparcos catalogues, adding the contributions of the diffuse galactic and extragalactic light, zodiacal light and airglow, and taking into account the effects of atmospheric attenuation and scattering. The model allows computing the natural sky brightness in any given photometric band for a ground-based observer, if appropriate transformations from the Gaia bands are available. In this work we present the most recent improvements of the model, including the use of Gaia EDR3 data, the inclusion of a wide set of photometric bands and the derivation of additional sky brightness indicators, as the horizontal irradiance and the average hemispheric radiance
