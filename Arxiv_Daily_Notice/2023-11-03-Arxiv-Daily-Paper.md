#### HIDM: Emulating Large Scale HI Maps using Score-based Diffusion Models
 - **Authors:** Sultan Hassan, Sambatra Andrianomena
 - **Subjects:** Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00833
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.00833
 - **Abstract**
 Efficiently analyzing maps from upcoming large-scale surveys requires gaining direct access to a high-dimensional likelihood and generating large-scale fields with high fidelity, which both represent major challenges. Using CAMELS simulations, we employ the state-of-the-art score-based diffusion models to simultaneously achieve both tasks. We show that our model, HIDM, is able to efficiently generate high fidelity large scale HI maps that are in a good agreement with the CAMELS's power spectrum, probability distribution, and likelihood up to second moments. HIDM represents a step forward towards maximizing the scientific return of future large scale surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Line intensity mapping is a promising probe of the universe's large-scale structure. We explore the sensitivity of the DSA-2000, a forthcoming array consisting of over 2000 dishes, to the statistical power spectrum of neutral hydrogen's 21 cm emission line. These measurements would reveal the distribution of neutral hydrogen throughout the near-redshift universe without necessitating resolving individual sources. The success of these measurements relies on the instrument's sensitivity and resilience to systematics. We show that the DSA-2000 will have the sensitivity needed to detect the 21 cm power spectrum at z=0.5 and across power spectrum modes of 0.03-31.32 h/Mpc with 0.1 h/Mpc resolution. We find that supplementing the nominal array design with a dense core of 200 antennas will expand its sensitivity at low power spectrum modes and enable measurement of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs). Finally, we present a qualitative discussion of the DSA-2000's unique resilience to sources of systematic error that can preclude 21 cm intensity mapping.
#### Synthesis of urea on the surface of interstellar water ice clusters. A  quantum chemical study
 - **Authors:** J. Perrero, A. Rimola
 - **Subjects:** Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)

 - **Abstract**
 Urea is a prebiotic molecule that has been detected in few sources of the interstellar medium (ISM) and in Murchison meteorite. Being stable against ultraviolet radiation and high-energy electron bombardment, urea is expected to be present in interstellar ices. Theoretical and experimental studies suggest that isocyanic acid (HNCO) and formamide (NH$_2$CHO) are possible precursors of urea. However, uncertainties still exist regarding its formation routes. Previous computational works characterised urea formation in the gas phase or in presence of few water molecules by reaction of formamide with nitrogen-bearing species. In this work, we investigated the reaction of HNCO + NH$_3$ on an 18 water molecules ice cluster model mimicking interstellar ice mantles by means of quantum chemical computations. We characterised different mechanisms involving both closed-shell and open-shell species at B3LYP-D3(BJ)/ma-def2-TZVP level of theory, in which the radical-radical H$_2$NCO + NH$_2$ coupling has been found to be the most favourable one due to being almost barrierless. In this path, the presence of the icy surfaces is crucial for acting as reactant concentrators/suppliers, as well as third bodies able to dissipate the energy liberated during the urea formation.
#### Studying the variability of fluorescence emission and the presence of  clumpy wind in HMXB GX 301$-$2 using XMM-Newton

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01176
 - **Abstract**
 We present the results from an analysis of data from an \textit{XMM-Newton} observation of the accreting high mass X-ray binary pulsar GX 301$-$2. Spectral analysis in the non-flaring segment of the observation revealed that the equivalent width of the iron fluorescence emission is correlated with the observed absorption column density and the ratio of the iron K$\beta$ and K$\alpha$ line strength varied with the flux of the source. Coherent pulsations were detected with the spin period of the pulsar of 687.9$\pm$0.1 s, and a secondary pulsation was also detected with a period of 671.8$\pm$0.2 s, most prominent in the energy band of the iron line. At the spin period of the neutron star, the pulsation of the iron line has a low amplitude and the profile is different from the continuum. Pulse phase-resolved spectroscopy also revealed pulsations of the iron emission line during the non-flaring segment of the light curve. At the secondary period, both the iron line and the continuum have nearly identical pulse fraction and pulse profile. The additional periodicity can be attributed to the beat frequency between the spin of the neutron star and the Keplerian frequency of a stellar wind clump in retrograde motion around the neutron star. Reprocessed X-ray emissions originating from the clump can produce the observed secondary pulsations both in the continuum and the iron fluorescence line. The clump rotating around the neutron star is estimated to be approximately five lt-s away from the neutron star.
#### Potential Melting of Extrasolar Planets by Tidal Dissipation

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal heating on Io due to its finite eccentricity was predicted to drive surface volcanic activity, which was subsequently confirmed by the $\textit{Voyager}$ spacecrafts. Although the volcanic activity in Io is more complex, in theory volcanism can be driven by runaway melting in which the tidal heating increases as the mantle thickness decreases. We show that this runaway melting mechanism is generic for a composite planetary body with liquid core and solid mantle, provided that (i) the mantle rigidity, $\mu$, is comparable to the central pressure, i.e. $\mu/ (\rho g R_{\rm P})\gtrsim0.1$ for a body with density $\rho$, surface gravitational acceleration $g$, and radius $R_{\rm P}$, (ii) the surface is not molten, (iii) tides deposit sufficient energy, and (iv) the planet has nonzero eccentricity. We calculate the approximate liquid core radius as a function of $\mu/ (\rho g R_{\rm P})$, and find that more than $90\%$ of the core will melt due to this runaway for $\mu/ (\rho g R_{\rm P})\gtrsim1$. From all currently confirmed exoplanets, we find that the terrestrial planets in the L98-59 system are the most promising candidates for sustaining active volcanism. However, uncertainties regarding the quality factors and the details of tidal heating and cooling mechanisms prohibit definitive claims of volcanism on any of these planets. We generate synthetic transmission spectra of these planets assuming Venus-like atmospheric compositions with an additional 5, 50, and $98\%$ SO$_2$ component, which is a tracer of volcanic activity. We find a $\gtrsim 3 \sigma$ preference for a model with SO$_2$ with 5-10 transits with $\textit{JWST}$ for L98-59bcd.
#### New mass-loss rates of Magellanic Cloud B supergiants from global wind  models
 - **Authors:** J. Krticka, J. Kubat, I. Krtickova

 - **Abstract**
 We provide global models of line-driven winds of B supergiants for metallicities corresponding to the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. The velocity and density structure of the models is determined consistently from hydrodynamical equations with radiative force derived in the comoving frame and level populations computed from kinetic equilibrium equations. We provide a formula expressing the predicted mass-loss rates in terms of stellar luminosity, effective temperature, and metallicity. Predicted wind mass-loss rates decrease with decreasing metallicity as $\dot M\sim Z^{0.60}$ and are proportional to the stellar luminosity. The mass-loss rates increase below the region of the bistability jump at about 20\,kK because of iron recombination. In agreement with previous theoretical and observational studies, we find a smooth change of wind properties in the region of the bistability jump. With decreasing metallicity, the bistability jump becomes weaker and shifts to lower effective temperatures. At lower metallicities above the bistability jump, our predictions provide similar rates to those used in current evolutionary models, but our rates are significantly lower than older predictions below the bistability jump. Our predicted mass-loss rates agree with observational estimates derived from H$\alpha$ line assuming that observations of stellar winds from Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds are uniformly affected by clumping. The models nicely reproduce the dependence of terminal velocities on temperature derived from ultraviolet spectroscopy.
