#### CWTHF: Identifying Dark Matter Halos with Continuous Wavelet Transform

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological simulations are an important method for investigating the evolution of the Universe. In order to gain further insight into the processes of structure formation, it is necessary to identify isolated bound objects within the simulations, namely, the dark matter halos. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is an effective tool used as a halo finder due to its ability to extract clustering information from the input data. In this study, we introduce CWTHF (Continuous Wavelet Transform Halo Finder), the first wavelet-based, MPI-parallelized halo finder, marking a novel approach in the field of cosmology. We calculate the CWT from the cloud-in-cell (CIC) grid and segment the grid based on the local CWT maxima. We then investigate the effects of the parameters that influence our program and identify the default settings. A comparison with the conventional friends-of-friends (FOF) method demonstrates the viability of CWT for halo finding. Although the actual performance is not faster than FOF, the linear time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$ of our identification scheme indicates its significant potential for future optimization and application.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsars, highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars, can have significant muon abundances in their dense cores, making them promising environments to probe ultralight mediators coupled to muons. The precise measurement of periastron advance in binary pulsar systems provides a sensitive probe of such long-range forces. In this work, we study the periastron advance constraints from binary pulsar systems on the ultralight muonic mediators. We compute the muon number fraction in neutron stars, by properly taking into account the suppression effect of the long-range muonic force. We find that the periastron advance constraints impose the most stringent constraints on ultralight muonic mediators in the mass range of $\simeq(10^{-17},\,2\times10^{-15})$ eV, probing muonic couplings as small as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-21})$, which surpass the limits from LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave measurements, by about an order of magnitude.
#### Explaining JWST star formation history at $z \sim 17$ by modifying $\Lambda$CDM

 - **Abstract**
 Recent cosmological observations indicate a $5\sigma$ discrepancy between the values of the Hubble constant $H_0$ derived from late and early universe probes. A further possible tension at the $\sim 3\sigma$ level arises from different measurements of $\sigma_8$. These measurements suggest the existence of new physics. Here, we explore several theories of modified gravity that may help to resolve these cosmological tensions. These include a family of phenomenological modified theories, where only Newton's gravitational constant and the Einstein-Boltzmann equations are affected. We consider one particular class of these theories: cosmologies with varying growth index $\gamma$ and varying dark energy Equation of State (EoS) $w_\Lambda$. We also consider the normal branch of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) model as well as $k$-mouflage gravity, which involves a non-trivially coupled scalar field. Our main aim is to narrow down the modified gravity landscape by constraining each model using high-redshift JWST data. Several probes are considered in this work: Stellar Mass Function (SMF), Stellar Mass Density (SMD), Star Formation Rate Density (SFRD) and Ultra-Violet Luminosity Function (UVLF) along with the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We find that generally, the choice of $r_c\gtrsim 10^{3.5}$ Mpc is preferred for nDGP, while $\beta\sim0.1$, $K_0\gtrsim 0.9$ is favored for $k$-mouflage. Moreover, in the context of phenomenological gravity, phantom-like dark energy EoS $w_\Lambda\lesssim -1$ is preferred over the quintessence.
#### Kinematics of the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal core: A 5D Analysis for a 6D Methodology with Gaia DR3
 - **Authors:** Isabelle S. Goldstein, Louis E. Strigari
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11138

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11138

 - **Abstract**
 Using Gaia DR3 data, we examine the kinematics of the central core of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy using data which includes proper motions and line-of-sight velocities for member stars in addition to their projected positions. We extract a sample of bright stars that are high-probability members of Sgr. We model the distances to these stars, which is the only missing phase-space component measurement from our 5D sample, highlighting how their corresponding uncertainties propagate to affect the kinematics. Using line-of-sight velocity data only, which are not affected by the distance uncertainties, and assuming a jeans-based equilibrium analysis, we obtain a velocity anisotropy of $\beta_a = -2.24 \pm 1.99$, which implies a system with tangentially-biased orbits. With the full 5D data, we project that the data will significantly improve upon measurements of the log-slope of the dark matter density profile and the stellar velocity anisotropy. Tests with mock distance data show an improvement of anisotropy errors of approximately an order of magnitude, and log slope at the half light radius of approximately half an order of magnitude.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are a target for current generation gravitational wave detectors with an expected rate of 1-3 per century. The development of data analysis methods used for their detection relies deeply on the availability of waveform templates. However, realistic numerical simulations producing such waveforms are computationally expensive (millions of CPU hours and $10^2-10^3$~GB of memory), and only a few tens of them are available nowadays in the literature. We have developed a novel parametrized phenomenological waveform generator for CCSNe, ccphen v4, that reproduces the morphology of numerical simulation waveforms with low computational cost ($\sim 10$~ms CPU time and a few MB of memory use). For the first time, the phenomenological waveforms include polarization and the effect of several oscillation modes in the proto-neutron star. This is sufficient to describe the case of non-rotating progenitor cores, representing the vast majority of possible events. The waveforms include a stochastic component and are calibrated using numerical simulation data. The code is publicly available. Their main application is the training of neural networks used in detection pipelines, but other applications in this context are also discussed.
#### Comparison of Herschel and ArT\'eMiS observations of massive filaments

 - **Abstract**
 Context: OMC-3 in the Orion A Cloud is a nearby, high-mass star-forming region, and therefore ideal to study massive filaments in detail. Aims: We analyze how the inclusion of higher-resolution data changes the estimates of the filament properties and test the robustness of filament fitting routines. Methods. ArTéMiS and Herschel data are combined to create high-resolution images. Column densities and temperatures are estimated with modified blackbody fitting. The nearby OMC-3 cloud is compared to the more distant G202 and G17 clouds. We compare the OMC-3 cloud as it appears at Herschel and ArTéMiS resolution. Results. Column densities of dense clumps in OMC-3 are higher in combined ArTéMiS and Herschel data (FWHM 8.5"), when compared to Herschel-only data (FWHM 20"). Estimated filament widths are smaller in the combined maps, and also show signs of further fragmentation when observed with the ArTéMiS resolution. In the analysis of Herschel data the estimated filament widths are correlated with the distance of the field. Conclusions. Median filament FWHM in OMC-3 at higher resolution is 0.05 pc, but 0.1 pc with the Herschel resolution, 0.3 pc in G202 and 1.0 pc in G17, also at the Herschel resolution. It is unclear what causes the steep relation between distance and filament FWHM, but likely reasons include the effect of the limited telescope resolution combined with existing hierarchical structure, and convolution of large-scale background structures within the ISM. Estimates of the asymptotic power-law index of the filament profile function p is high. When fit with the Plummer function, the individual parameters of the profile function are degenerate, while the FWHM is better constrained. OMC-3 shows negative kurtosis, and all but OMC-3 at the Herschel resolution some asymmetry.
#### GOTO065054+593624: a peculiar dwarf nova identified in real time via Kilonova Seekers

 - **Abstract**
 Dwarf novae are a crucial astrophysical laboratory for probing the nature of accretion, binary mass transfer, and binary evolution -- yet their diverse observational characteristics continue to challenge our theoretical understanding. We here present the discovery of, and subsequent observing campaign on GOTO065054+593624 (hereafter GOTO0650), a dwarf nova of the WZ Sge type, discovered in real-time by citizen scientists via the Kilonova Seekers citizen science project. An extensive dataset charts the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of this object, covering the first two months of its 2024 superoutburst. GOTO0650 shows a complete absence of visible emission lines during the high state, strong H and barely-detected He~II emission, and high-amplitude echo outbursts with a rapidly decreasing timescale that together do not neatly fit in with our current view of cataclysmic variables. The comprehensive dataset presented here not only underscores the uniqueness of this dwarf nova and marks it as a candidate period bouncer, but also highlights the important contribution that citizen scientists can make to the study of Galactic transients.

 - **Abstract**
 We present 450$\mu$m and 850$\mu$m James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) observations of the Corona Australis (CrA) molecular cloud taken as part of the JCMT Gould Belt Legacy Survey (GBLS). We present a catalogue of 39 starless and protostellar sources, for which we determine source temperatures and masses using SCUBA-2 450$\mu$m/850$\mu$m flux density ratios for sources with reliable 450$\mu$m detections, and compare these to values determined using temperatures measured by the Herschel Gould Belt Survey (HGBS). In keeping with previous studies, we find that SCUBA-2 preferentially detects high-volume-density starless cores, which are most likely to be prestellar (gravitationally bound). We do not observe any anti-correlation between temperature and volume density in the starless cores in our sample. Finally, we combine our SCUBA-2 and Herschel data to perform SED fitting from 160-850$\mu$m across the central Coronet region, thereby measuring dust temperature $T$, dust emissivity index $\beta$ and column density $N({\rm H}_2)$ across the Coronet. We find that $\beta$ varies across the Coronet, particularly measuring $\beta = 1.55 \pm 0.35$ in the colder starless SMM-6 clump to the north of the B star R CrA. This relatively low value of $\beta$ is suggestive of the presence of large dust grains in SMM-6, even when considering the effects of $T-\beta$ fitting degeneracy and $^{12}$CO contamination of SCUBA-2 850$\mu$m data on the measured $\beta$ values.
#### B-fields And dust in interstelLar fiLAments using Dust POLarization (BALLAD-POL): III. Grain alignment and disruption mechanisms in G34.43+0.24 using polarization observations from JCMT/POL-2

 - **Abstract**
 Polarization of starlight and thermal dust emission due to aligned non-spherical grains helps us to trace magnetic field (B-field) morphology in molecular clouds and to study grain alignment mechanisms. In this work, we study grain alignment and disruption mechanisms in a filamentary infrared dark cloud G34.43+0.24 using thermal dust polarization observations from JCMT/POL-2 at 850 $\mu\text{m}$. We study in three sub-regions as North harboring MM3 core, Center harboring MM1 and MM2 cores and South having no core. We find the decrease in polarization fraction P with increasing total intensity and gas column density, known as polarization hole. To disentangle the effect of magnetic field tangling on the polarization hole, we estimate the polarization angle dispersion function. We find depolarizations in North and Center regions are due to decrease in net alignment efficiency of grains but in South region, effect of magnetic field tangling is significant to cause depolarization. To test whether RAdiative Torque (RAT) mechanism can reproduce the observational data, we calculate minimum alignment and disruption sizes of grains using RAT theory and our study finds that RAT alignment mechanism can explain the depolarizations in North and Center regions where B-field tangling effect is less important, except for core regions. We find hints of RAdiative Torque Disruption (RAT-D) in the core regions of MM3 in North, MM1 and MM2 in Center. We also find that the high P value of around 8-20% in the outer regions of the filament can be explained potentially by magnetically enhanced RAT alignment mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanets are detected around stars of different ages and birthplaces within the Galaxy. The aim of this work is to infer the Galactic birth radii ($r_\text{birth}$) of stars and, consequently, their planets, with the ultimate goal of studying the Galactic aspects of exoplanet formation. We used photometric, spectroscopic, and astrometric data to estimate the stellar ages of two samples of stars hosting planets and, for comparison, a sample of stars without detected planets. The $r_\text{birth}$ of exoplanets were inferred by projecting stars back to their birth positions based on their estimated age and metallicity [Fe/H]. We find that stars hosting planets have higher [Fe/H], are younger, and have smaller $r_\text{birth}$ compared to stars without detected planets. In particular, stars hosting high-mass planets show higher [Fe/H], are younger, and have smaller $r_\text{birth}$ than stars hosting low-mass planets. We show that the formation efficiency of planets, calculated as the relative frequency of planetary systems, decreases with the galactocentric distance, which relationship is stronger for high-mass planets than for low-mass planets. Additionally, we find that (i) the formation efficiency of high-mass planets increases with time and encompasses a larger galactocentric distance over time; (ii) the formation efficiency of low-mass planets shows a slight increase between the ages of 4 and 8 Gyr and also encompasses a larger galactocentric distance over time; and (iii) stars without detected planets appear to form at larger galactocentric distances over time. We conclude that the formation of exoplanets throughout the Galaxy follows the Galactic chemical evolution, for which our results are in agreement with the observed negative interstellar medium (ISM) metallicity gradient and its enrichment and flattening with time at any radius.

 - **Abstract**
 The last decade has witnessed remarkable advances in the characterization of the (sub-)millimeter emission from planet-forming disks. Instead, the study of the (sub-)centimeter emission has made more limited progress, to the point that only a few exceptional disk-bearing objects have been characterized in the centimeter regime. This work takes a broad view of the centimeter emission from a large sample with VLA observations that is selected from previous ALMA surveys of more representative disks in brightness and extent. We report on the detection and characterization of flux at centimeter wavelengths from 21 sources in the Taurus star-forming region. Complemented by literature and archival data, the entire photometry from 0.85 mm to 6 cm is fitted by a two-component model that determines the ubiquitous presence of free-free emission entangled with the dust emission. The flux density of the free-free emission is found to scale with the accretion rate but is independent of the outer disk morphology depicted by ALMA. The dust emission at 2 cm is still appreciable, and offers the possibility to extract an unprecedented large set of dust spectral indices in the centimeter regime. A pronounced change between the median millimeter indices (2.3) and centimeter indices (2.8) suggests that a large portion of the disk emission is optically thick up to 3 mm. The comparison of both indices and fluxes with the ALMA disk extent indicates that this portion can be as large as 40 au, and suggests that the grain population within this disk region that emits the observed centimeter emission is similar in disks with different size and morphology. All these results await confirmation and dedicated dust modeling once facilities like ngVLA or SKA-mid are able to resolve the centimeter emission from planet-forming disks and disentangle the various components.
#### The TW Hydrae Association is a cluster chain of Sco-Cen

 - **Abstract**
 The TW Hydrae Association (TWA) is a young local association (YLA) about 50 pc from the Sun, offering a unique opportunity to study star and planet formation processes in detail. We characterized TWA's location, kinematics, and age, investigating its origin within the Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco-Cen) OB association. Using Gaia DR3 astrometric data and precise ground-based radial velocities, we identified substructures within TWA, tentatively dividing them into TWA-a and TWA-b. Sco-Cen's massive cluster $\sigma$ Cen (15 Myr, 1,805 members) may have influenced TWA's formation. The alignment of $\sigma$ Cen, TWA-a, and TWA-b in 3D positions, velocities, and ages resembles patterns in regions such as Corona Australis, suggesting that TWA is part of a cluster chain from sequential star formation induced by massive stars in Sco-Cen. TWA's elongation in the opposite direction to that produced by Galactic differential rotation indicates its shape is still influenced by its formation processes and will dissipate in less than 50 Myr due to Galactic forces. These findings unveil the nature of YLAs and low-mass clusters in a new light. We propose that clusters such as $\epsilon$ Chamaeleontis, $\eta$ Chamaeleontis, and TWA were forged by stellar feedback from massive stars in Sco-Cen, while others--such as $\beta$ Pictoris, Carina, Columba, and Tucana-Horologium--are older and formed differently. Remarkably, all these YLAs and Sco-Cen are part of the $\alpha$ Persei cluster family, a vast kiloparsec-scale star formation event active over the past 60 Myr. This suggests that YLAs are the smallest stellar structures emerging from major star formation episodes and should be common in the Milky Way. Crucially, their formation in regions with intense stellar feedback may have influenced planet formation in these systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep high-dispersion spectroscopy of Galactic photoionized gaseous nebulae, mainly planetary nebulae and HII regions, has revealed numerous emission lines. As a key step of spectral analysis, identification of emission lines hitherto has mostly been done manually, which is a tedious task, given that each line needs to be carefully checked against huge volumes of atomic transition/spectroscopic database to reach a reliable assignment of identity. Using Python, we have developed a line-identification code PyEMILI, which is a significant improvement over the Fortran-based package EMILI introduced ~20 years ago. In our new code PyEMILI, the major shortcomings in EMILI's line-identification technique have been amended. Moreover, the atomic transition database utilized by PyEMILI was adopted from Atomic Line List v3.00b4 but greatly supplemented with theoretical transition data from the literature. The effective recombination coefficients of the CII, OII, NII and NeII nebular lines are collected from the literature to form a subset of the atomic transition database to aid identification of faint optical recombination lines in the spectra of PNe and HII regions. PyEMILI is tested using the deep, high-dispersion spectra of two Galactic PNe, Hf2-2 and IC418, and gives better results of line identification than EMILI does. We also ran PyEMILI on the optical spectrum of a late-type [WC11] star UVQS J060819.93-715737.4 recently discovered in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and our results agree well with the previous manual identifications. The new identifier PyEMILI is applicable to not only emission-line nebulae but also emission stars, such as Wolf-Rayet stars.
#### Examining Turbulence in Galactic Molecular Clouds -- I: A Statistical Analysis of Velocity Structures

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic analysis of the velocity structure functions (VSFs) of 167 molecular clouds with angular sizes greater than $\sim$176 arcmin$^2$ in three sectors of the Galactic mid-plane. We calculated the 1st- to 3rd-order VSFs and found that 60\% of the VSFs exhibit power-law distributions. The relative power-law exponents are consistent with predictions from intermittent turbulence models. Column density weighting reduces the proportion of power-law VSFs and steepens the VSF slopes, implying a reduction of turbulent energy in high-density regions. All clouds show small-scale intermittency, with slightly stronger intermittency in those molecular clouds showing none power-law VSFs. Negative VSF exponents that may indicate gravitational collapse are not observed in our sample. The scaling exponents of the observed VSFs do not correlate with the virial parameters of the molecular clouds. These two observations suggest that gravity-dominated scales in molecular clouds still need further investigation. Consistent VSF scaling exponents for the molecular clouds with significant power-law VSFs suggest large-scale external driving of turbulence in these molecular clouds. However, the driving mechanisms are likely not universal, as the power-law scaling coefficients in our results show relatively large scatter. The fact that nearly 40\% of the VSFs deviate to some extent from power-law distributions suggests that the influence of local environments on the internal turbulence of molecular clouds may not be negligible.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a census of 100 pulsars, the largest below 100 MHz, including 94 normal pulsars and six millisecond pulsars, with the Long Wavelength Array (LWA). Pulse profiles are detected across a range of frequencies from 26 to 88 MHz, including new narrow-band profiles facilitating profile evolution studies and breaks in pulsar spectra at low frequencies. We report mean flux density, spectral index, curvature, and low-frequency turnover frequency measurements for 97 pulsars, including new measurements for 61 sources. Multi-frequency profile widths are presented for all pulsars, including component spacing for 27 pulsars with two components. Polarized emission is detected from 27 of the sources (the largest sample at these frequencies) in multiple frequency bands, with one new detection. We also provide new timing solutions for five recently-discovered pulsars. Low-frequency observations with the LWA are especially sensitive to propagation effects arising in the interstellar medium. We have made the most sensitive measurements of pulsar dispersion measures (DMs) and rotation measures (RMs), with median uncertainties of 2.9x10^-4 pc cm^-3 and 0.01 rad m^-2, respectively, and can track their variations over almost a decade, along with other frequency-dependent effects. This allows stringent limits on average magnetic fields, with no variations detected above ~20 nG. Finally, the census yields some interesting phenomena in individual sources, including the detection of frequency and time-dependent DM variations in B2217+47, and the detection of highly circularly polarized emission from J0051+0423.

The SMA $^{12}$CO(2--1) mapping data, with $\sim$3$''$ spatial resolution and 2 km s$^{-1}$ velocity resolution, provide an unprecedentedly detailed, 3D view of the Ring's clumpy molecular envelope. The morphology of the velocity-integrated SMA $^{12}$CO(2--1) image closely resembles those of near-IR H$_2$ and PAH emission in JWST/NIRCam imaging of NGC~6720, with the molecular gas forming a geometrically thin layer surrounding the ionized gas imaged by HST and JWST. A simple, geometrical model of the $^{12}$CO(2--1) data shows that the intrinsic structure of NGC~6720's molecular envelope closely resembles a truncated, triaxial ellipsoid that is viewed close to pole-on, and that the dynamical age of the molecular envelope is $\sim$6000 yr. The SMA $^{12}$CO(2--1) data furthermore reveal that filamentary features seen projected in the Ring's interior in JWST imaging are in fact fast-moving polar knots or bullets with radial velocities of $\pm$45--50 km s$^{-1}$ relative to systemic, and that the hot progenitor star remnant is positioned at the precise geometric center of the clumpy, ellipsoidal molecular shell. We assert that the Ring's molecular envelope was formed via a relatively sudden, AGB-terminating mass ejection event $\sim$6000 yr ago, and that this ellipsoidal envelope was then punctured by fast, collimated polar outflows resulting from interactions between the progenitor and one or more companion stars. Such an evolutionary scenario may describe most molecule-rich, ``Ring-like'' planetary nebulae.
