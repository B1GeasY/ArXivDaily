 - **Abstract**
 The theory of how low mass stars form from the collapse of a dense molecular cloud core has been well-established for decades. Thanks to significant progress in computing and numerical modelling, more physical models have been developed and a wider parameter space explored to understand the early stages of star formation more fully. In this review, I describe the expected physical properties of the first and second core stages and how the inclusion of different physics affects those predicted characteristics. I provide an overview of chemical models and synthetic observations, looking towards the positive identification of the first core in nature, which remains elusive. However, there are a few likely candidate first cores, which are listed, and I briefly discuss the recent progress in characterising the youngest protostellar sources. Chemistry will be instrumental in the firm identification of the first core so we require robust theoretical predictions of the chemical evolution of protostellar cores, especially of the first and second core outflows. Looking ahead, simulations can shed light on how the protostellar collapse phase shapes the evolution of the protostellar disc. Simulations of dust evolution during protostellar core collapse show there is significant enhancement in grain size and abundance towards the centre of the core. Chemical models show that the warm, dense conditions of the first core drive chemical evolution. There is a wide scope for further study of the role that the first and second core stages play in determining the structure and composition of the protostellar disc and envelope and, of course, the eventual influence on the formation of planets.
#### Analysis of the 3.2-3.3 $μ$m Interstellar Absorption Feature on Three  Milky Way Sightlines
 - **Authors:** L. S. Bernstein, T. R. Geballe

 - **Abstract**
 We report new analyses of spectra of the $3.2-3.3~\mu$m absorption feature observed in the diffuse interstellar medium toward three Milky Way sources: 2MASS $J17470898-2829561$ (2M1747) and the Quintuplet Cluster, both located in the Galactic center, and Cygnus OB2-12. The $3.2-3.3~\mu$m interval coincides with the CH-stretching region for compact polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We focus on the 2M1747 spectrum. Its published optical depth spectrum contains residual telluric transmission features, which arise from the 0.06 difference in mean airmasses between the observations of the source and its telluric standard star. We corrected the published spectrum by adding the airmass residual optical depth spectrum. The corrected spectrum is well fit by a superposition of four Gaussians. The absorption spectra of the other two sources were also fit by four Gaussians, with similar central wavelengths, widths, and relative peak opacities. We associate the three longer wavelength Gaussians covering the $3.23-3.31~\mu$m interval with compact PAHs in positive, neutral, and negative charge states. We identify the shortest wavelength Gaussian, near 3.21 $\mu$m, with irregularly-shaped PAHs. Constraints imposed by spectral smoothness on the corrected 2M1747 spectrum, augmented by a PAH cluster formation model for post-asymptotic giant branch stars, suggests that $> 99$\%\ of the PAHs in the diffuse interstellar medium reside in small clusters. This study supports the PAH hypothesis, and suggests that a family of primarily compact PAHs with a C$_{66}$H$_{20}$ (circumvalene) parent is consistent with the observed mid-infrared and ultraviolet interstellar absorption spectrum.
#### Successful $νp$-process in neutrino-driven outflows in core-collapse  supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the solar system abundances of several proton-rich isotopes, especially $^{92,94}$Mo and $^{96,98}$Ru, has been an enduring mystery in nuclear astrophysics. An attractive proposal to solve this problem is the $\nu p$-process, which can operate in neutrino-driven outflows in a core-collapse supernova after the shock is launched. Years of detailed studies, however, have cast doubt over the ability of this process to generate sufficiently high absolute and relative amounts of various $p$-nuclei. The $\nu p$-process is also thought to be excluded by arguments based on the long-lived radionuclide $^{92}$Nb. Here, we present explicit calculations, in which both the abundance ratios and the absolute yields of the $p$-nuclei up to $A\lesssim105$ are successfully reproduced, even when using the modern (medium enhanced) triple-$\alpha$ reaction rates. The process is also shown to produce the necessary amounts of $^{92}$Nb. The models are characterized by subsonic outflows and by the protoneutron star masses in the {$\gtrsim1.7 M_\odot$ range}. This suggests that the Mo and Ru $p$-nuclides observed in the Solar System were made in CCSN explosions characterized by an extended accretion stage.
#### The HI study of XMP gas-rich dwarfs in nearby voids-I

 - **Abstract**
 We present and discuss the results of the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) HI 21-cm line mapping for five isolated low-mass (M_bary ~(2--8)*10^7 Mo) eXtremely Metal Poor (XMP) dwarfs [12+log(O/H)=7.13-7.28], selected from the Nearby Void Galaxy (NVG) sample. All the studied void dwarfs show the disturbed morphology in the HI maps with the angular resolutions of ~11" to ~40". We examine the HI morphology and velocity field and the relative orientation of their stellar and gas body spins. We discuss the overall non-equilibrium state of their gas and the possible origin and evolution of the studied void dwarfs. The most straightforward interpretation of the ubiquitous phenomenon of the gas component non-equilibrium state in these and similar void dwarfs is the cold accretion from the void filaments and/or minor mergers. The cold gas accretion in voids could be linked to the presence of small filaments that constitute the substructure of voids.
#### Criss Cross Nebula: Case study of shock regions with resolved  microstructures at scales of $\sim$1000 AU

 - **Abstract**
 Using integral field spectroscopy from MaNGA, we study the resolved microstructures in a shocked region in Criss Cross Nebula (CCN), with an unprecedentedly high resolution of $\lesssim$1000 AU. We measure surface brightness maps for 34 emission lines, which can be broadly divided into three categories: (1) the [OIII] $\lambda$5007-like group including seven high-ionization lines and two [OII] auroral lines which uniformly present a remarkable lane structure, (2) the H$\alpha$ $\lambda$6563-like group including 23 low-ionization or recombination lines which present a clump-like structure, and (3) [OII] $\lambda$3726 and [OII] $\lambda$3729 showing high densities at both the [OIII] $\lambda$5007 lane and the H$\alpha$ clump. We use these measurements to constrain resolved shock models implemented in MAPPINGS V. We find our data can be reasonably well-fitted by a model which includes a plane-parallel shock with a velocity of $133\pm5$ km/s, plus an isotropic two-dimensional Gaussian component which is likely another clump of gas ionized by photons from the shocked region, and a constant background. We compare the electron density and temperature profiles as predicted by our model with those calculated using observed emission line ratios. We find different line ratios to provide inconsistent temperature maps, and the discrepancies can be attributed to observational effects caused by limited spatial resolution and projection of the shock geometry, as well as contamination of the additional Gaussian component. Implications on shock properties and perspectives on future IFS-based studies of CCN are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 A complete accounting of nearby objects -- from the highest-mass white dwarf progenitors down to low-mass brown dwarfs -- is now possible, thanks to an almost complete set of trigonometric parallax determinations from Gaia, ground-based surveys, and Spitzer follow-up. We create a census of objects within a Sun-centered sphere of 20-pc radius and check published literature to decompose each binary or higher-order system into its separate components. The result is a volume-limited census of $\sim$3,600 individual star formation products useful in measuring the initial mass function across the stellar ($<8 M_\odot$) and substellar ($\gtrsim 5 M_{Jup}$) regimes. Comparing our resulting initial mass function to previous measurements shows good agreement above 0.8$M_\odot$ and a divergence at lower masses. Our 20-pc space densities are best fit with a quadripartite power law, $\xi(M) = dN/dM \propto M^{-\alpha}$ with long-established values of $\alpha = 2.3$ at high masses ($0.55 < M < 8.00 M_\odot$) and $\alpha = 1.3$ at intermediate masses ($0.22 < M < 0.55 M_\odot$), but at lower masses we find $\alpha = 0.25$ for $0.05 < M <0.22 M_\odot$ and $\alpha = 0.6$ for $0.01 < M < 0.05 M_\odot$. This implies that the rate of production as a function of decreasing mass diminishes in the low-mass star/high-mass brown dwarf regime before increasing again in the low-mass brown dwarf regime. Correcting for completeness, we find a star to brown dwarf number ratio of, currently, 4:1, and an average mass per object of 0.41 $M_\odot$.
