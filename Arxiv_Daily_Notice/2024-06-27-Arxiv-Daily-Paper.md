#### Numerical Modeling of Galactic Superwinds with Time-evolving Stellar Feedback

 - **Abstract**
 Mass-loss and radiation feedback from evolving massive stars produce galactic-scale superwinds, sometimes surrounded by pressure-driven bubbles. Using the time-dependent stellar population typically seen in star-forming regions, we conduct hydrodynamic simulations of a starburst-driven superwind model coupled with radiative efficiency rates to investigate the formation of radiative cooling superwinds and bubbles. Our numerical simulations depict the parameter space where radiative cooling superwinds with or without bubbles occur. Moreover, we employ the physical properties and time-dependent ionization states to predict emission line profiles under the assumption of collisional ionization and non-equilibrium ionization caused by wind thermal feedback in addition to photoionization created by the radiation background. We see the dependence of non-equilibrium ionization structures on the time-evolving ionizing source, leading to a deviation from collisional ionization in radiative cooling wind regions over time.

 - **Abstract**
 Disk vortices, seen in numerical simulations of protoplanetary disks and found observationally in ALMA and VLA images of these objects, are promising sites for planet formation given their pebble trapping abilities. Previous works have shown strong concentration of pebbles in vortices, but gravitational collapse has only been shown in low-resolution, two-dimensional, global models. In this letter, we aim to study the pebble concentration and gravitational collapse of pebble clouds in vortices via high-resolution, three-dimensional, local models. We performed simulations of the dynamics of gas and solids in a local shearing box where the gas is subject to convective overstability, generating a persistent giant vortex. We find that the vortex produces objects of Moon and Mars mass, with mass function of power law $d\ln N/d\ln M=-1.6\pm 0.3$. The protoplanets grow rapidly, doubling in mass in about 5 orbits, following pebble accretion rates. The mass range and mass doubling rate are in broad agreement with previous low resolution global models. We conclude that Mars-mass planetary embryos are the natural outcome of planet formation inside the disk vortices seen in millimeter and radio images of protoplanetary disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Constraints on the binary fraction of young massive stellar objects (mYSOs) are important for binary and massive star formation theory. Here, we present speckle imaging of 34 mYSOs located in the Large (1/2 $Z_{\odot}$) and Small Magellanic Clouds ($\sim$1/5 $Z_{\odot}$), probing projected separations between the 2000-20000 au (at angular scales of 0.02-0.2") range, for stars above 8 $M_{\odot}$. We find two wide binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud (from a sample of 23 targets), but none in a sample of 11 in the Small Magellanic Cloud, leading us to adopt a wide binary fraction of 9$\pm$5%, and $<$5%, respectively. We rule out a wide binary fraction greater than 35% in the Large, and 38% in the Small Magellanic Cloud at the 99% confidence level. This is in contrast to the wide binary fraction of mYSOs in the Milky Way (presumed $Z_{\odot}$), which within the physical parameter space probed by this study is $\sim$15-60% from the literature. We argue that while selection effects could be responsible for the lower binary fraction observed; it is more likely that there are underlying physical mechanisms responsible for the observed properties. This indicates that metallicity and environmental effects may influence the formation of wide binaries among massive stars. Future larger, statistically more significant samples of high-mass systems in low-metallicity environments, and for comparison in the Milky Way, are essential to confirm or repudiate our claim.
#### Linear adiabatic analysis for general relativistic instability in primordial accreting supermassive stars

 - **Abstract**
 Accreting supermassive stars of $\gtrsim 10^{5}\,M_\odot$ will eventually collapse directly to a black hole via the general relativistic (GR) instability. Such direct collapses of supermassive stars are thought to be a possible formation channel for supermassive black holes at $z > 6$. In this work, we investigate the final mass of accreting Population III stars with constant accretion rates between $0.01$ and $1000\,M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$. We determine the final mass by solving the differential equation for the general relativistic linear adiabatic radial pulsations. We find that models with accretion rates $\gtrsim 0.05\,M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ experience the GR instability at masses depending on the accretion rates. The critical masses are larger for higher accretion rates, ranging from $8\times10^{4}\,M_\odot$ for $0.05\,M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ to $\sim10^6\,M_\odot$ for $1000\,M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$. The $0.05\,M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ model reaches the GR instability at the end of the core hydrogen burning. The higher mass models with the higher accretion rates reach the GR instability during the hydrogen burning stage.

 - **Abstract**
 We present multi-frequency (5-345 GHz) and multi-resolution radio observations of 1ES 1927+654, widely considered one of the most unusual and extreme changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL-AGN). The source was first designated a CL-AGN after an optical outburst in late 2017 and has since displayed considerable changes in X-ray emission, including the destruction and rebuilding of the X-ray corona in 2019-2020. Radio observations prior to 2023 show a faint and compact radio source not unusual for radio-quiet AGN. Starting in February 2023, 1ES 1927+654 began exhibiting a radio flare with a steep exponential rise, reaching a peak 60 times previous flux levels, and has maintained this higher level of radio emission for nearly a year. The 5-23 GHz spectrum is broadly similar to gigahertz-peaked radio sources, which are understood to be young radio jets less than ~1000 years old. Recent high-resolution VLBA observations at 23.5 GHz now show resolved extensions on either side of the core, with a separation of 0.14 pc, consistent with a new and mildly relativistic bipolar outflow. A steady increase in the soft X-ray band (0.3-2 keV) concurrent with the radio may be consistent with jet-driven shocked gas, though further observations are needed to test alternate scenarios. This source joins a growing number of CL-AGN and tidal disruption events which show late-time radio activity, years after the initial outburst.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the wide-binary eccentricity ($e$) distribution in young star clusters and the role of turbulence in setting the form of the $e$ distribution using magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of star cluster formation. The simulations incorporate gravity, turbulence, magnetic fields, protostellar heating, and jets/outflows. We find that (1) simulations that employ purely compressive turbulence driving produce binaries with a superthermal $e$ distribution ($\alpha>1$ in $p(e) \propto e^\alpha$), while simulations with purely solenoidal driving or natural mixture of driving modes produce subthermal/thermal distributions ($\alpha \leq$ 1), (2) the $e$ distribution over the full range of binary separations in our simulations is set at the early stages of the star cluster formation process, (3) while binaries (separation of $r_{\mathrm{pair}} \leq 1000\, \mathrm{AU}$) have subthermal to thermal $e$ distributions ($\alpha \sim 0.8$), wide binaries ($r_{\mathrm{pair}} > 1000\, \mathrm{AU}$) have a superthermal distribution ($\alpha \sim 1.8$), and (4) low-mass binary systems (system masses of $M_{\mathrm{sys}} \leq 0.8\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) have a highly superthermal distribution ($\alpha \sim 2.4$), whereas high-mass systems ($M_{\mathrm{sys}} > 0.8\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) exhibit a subthermal/thermal distribution ($\alpha \sim 0.8$). The binary eccentricity distribution is often modelled as a thermal distribution. However, our results suggest that the $e$ distribution depends on the range of separation of the sampled binaries, which agrees with the findings from recent Gaia observations. We conclude that the dependence of the $e$ distribution on the binary separation and mass is linked to the binary formation mechanism governed by the turbulent properties of the parent cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 One way to shed some light on the star formation process this process is to analyse the relationship between the spatial distributions of gas and newly formed stars. In order to obtain robust results, it is necessary for this comparison to be made using quantitative and consistent descriptors applied to the same star-forming region. Here, we use fractal analysis to characterise and compare in a self-consistent way the structure of the cloud and the distribution of young stellar objects (YSO) in the Dragonfish star-forming complex. We used different emission maps of the Dragonfish Nebula and photometric information from the AllWISE catalogue to select a total of 1082 YSOs in the region, for some of which we derived physical properties from their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). For both datasets (cloud images and YSOs), the three-dimensional fractal dimension (Df) was calculated using previously developed and calibrated algorithms. The fractal dimension of the Dragonfish Nebula (Df = 2.6-2.7) agrees very well with values previously obtained for the Orion, Ophiuchus, and Perseus clouds. On the other hand, YSOs exhibit on average a significantly smaller value (Df = 1.9-2.0) that indicates a much more clumpy structure than the material from which they formed. This is a clear and direct evidence that the clustering degree of the newly born stars is significantly higher than that of the parent cloud from which they formed, but the physical mechanism behind this behaviour is still not clear. Additionally, younger Class I and Class II sources have smaller values (Df = 1.7 +/- 0.1) than more evolved Transition Disk objects (Df = 2.2 +/- 0.1), evidencing a certain evolutionary effect where an initially clumpy structure tends to gradually disappear over time.
#### A 3 mm spectral line study of the Central Molecular Zone infrared dark cloud G1.75-0.08

 - **Abstract**
 Infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) are fruitful objects to study the fragmentation of interstellar filaments and initial conditions and early stages of high-mass ($M>8$ M$_{\odot}$) star formation. We used the Yebes 40 m and IRAM 30 m radio telescopes to carry out the first single-pointing spectral line observations towards the IRDC G1.75-0.08, which is a filamentary Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) cloud. Our aim is to reach an improved understanding of the gas kinematics and dynamical state of the cloud and its two clumps that we call clumps A and B. We also aim to determine the fractional abundances of the molecules detected at 3 mm towards G1.75-0.08. We detected HNCO$(J_{K_a,\,K_c}=4_{0,\,4}-3_{0,\,3})$, HCN$(J=1-0)$, and HCO$^+(J=1-0)$ towards both clumps. The N$_2$H$^+(J=1-0)$ line was detected only in clump B, while N$_2$D$^+(J=1-0)$ was not detected at all. The HCN and HNCO spectra exhibit two velocity components. The abundances of the detected species are comparable to those in other IRDCs. An upper limit to the [N$_2$D$^+$]/[N$_2$H$^+$] deuterium fraction of $<0.05$ derived towards clump B is consistent with values observed in many high-mass clumps. The line mass analysis suggests that the G1.75-0.08 filament is subcritical by a factor of $11\pm6$, and the clumps were found to be gravitationally unbound ($\alpha_{\rm vir} > 2$). Our finding that G1.75-0.08 is strongly subcritical is atypical compared to the general population of Galactic filamentary clouds. The cloud's location in the CMZ might affect the cloud kinematics similar to what has been found for the Brick IRDC, and the cloud's dynamical state might also be the result of the turbulent motions or shear and tidal forces in the CMZ. Because the target clumps are dark at 70 $\mu$m and massive (several $10^3$ M$_{\odot}$), they can be considered candidates for being high-mass starless (but not prestellar) clumps.
#### White dwarf constraints on geological processes at the population level

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarf atmospheres are frequently polluted by material from their own planetary systems. Absorption features from Ca, Mg, Fe and other elements can provide unique insights into the provenance of this exoplanetary material, with their relative abundances being used to infer accretion of material with core- or mantle-like composition. Across the population of white dwarfs, the distribution of compositions reveals the prevalence of geological and collisional processing across exoplanetary systems. By predicting the distribution of compositions in three evolutionary scenarios, this work assesses whether they can explain current observations. We consider evolution in an asteroid belt analog, in which collisions between planetary bodies that formed an iron core lead to core- or mantle-rich fragments. We also consider layer-by-layer accretion of individual bodies, such that the apparent composition of atmospheric pollution changes during the accretion of a single body. Finally, we consider that compositional spread is due to random noise. We find that the distribution of Ca, Fe and Mg in a sample of 202 cool DZs is consistent with the random noise scenario, although 7 individual systems show strong evidence of core-mantle differentiation from additional elements and/or low noise levels. Future surveys which detect multiple elements in each of a few hundred white dwarfs, with well understood biases, have the potential to confidently distinguish between the three models.
