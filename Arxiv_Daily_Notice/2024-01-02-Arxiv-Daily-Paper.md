 - **Abstract**
 Low-mass giants with large amounts of lithium (Li) have challenged stellar evolution for decades. One of the possibilities usually discussed to explain them involves the interaction with a close binary companion. This predicts that when compared against their non-enriched counterparts, Li-rich giants should preferentially be found as part of binary systems. In order to test this scenario, we assemble a sample of 1418 giants with radial velocities (RVs) from RAVE, GALAH, and Gaia, as well as stellar parameters and Li abundances from GALAH. Evolutionary states can be determined for 1030 of these giants. We develop a method that quantifies the degree of RV variability, which we use as a proxy for close binary companions. The method is tested and calibrated against samples of known RV standard stars and known spectroscopic binaries. We also compare the results of our RV variability analysis with binarity indicators from Gaia. We find that the accuracy of the classification is controlled by the precision of the RVs, which for the set of RVs available for the giants is 80-85%. Consistent with seismic studies, the resulting sample of giants contains a fraction of Li-rich objects in the red clump (RC) that is twice as large as that for first-ascent giants (RGB). Among RC giants, the fractions of Li-rich objects with high RV variability and with no RV variability are the same as those for Li-normal objects, which argues against a binary interaction scenario for the genesis of the bulk of Li-rich giants at that evolutionary stage. On the other hand, Li-rich giants in the RGB appear to have a small but detectable preference for higher RV variability, and thus possibly a larger close binary fraction, than the Li-normal giants at that stage. Additional measurements of the RVs of these giants at higher RV precision would greatly help confirm and more robustly quantify these results.
#### Caustics and velocity caustics in the diffuse interstellar medium at  high Galactic latitudes

 - **Abstract**
 The FIR distribution at high Galactic latitudes, observed with Planck, is filamentary with coherent structures in polarization. These structures are also closely related to HI filaments with coherent velocity structures. There is a long-standing debate about the physical nature of these structures. They are considered either as velocity caustics, fluctuations engraved by the turbulent velocity field or as cold three-dimensional density structures in the interstellar medium (ISM). We discuss different approaches to data analysis and interpretation in order to work out the differences. We considered mathematical preliminaries for the derivation of caustics that characterize filamentary structures in the ISM. Using the Hessian operator, we traced individual FIR filamentary structures in HI from channel maps as observed and alternatively from data that are provided by the velocity decomposition algorithm (VDA). VDA is claimed to separate velocity caustics from density effects. Based on the strict mathematical definition, the so-called velocity caustics are not actually caustics. These VDA data products may contain caustics in the same way as the original HI observations. Caustics derived by a Hessian analysis of both databases are nearly identical with a correlation coefficient of 98%. However, the VDA algorithm leads to a 30% increase in the alignment uncertainties when fitting FIR/HI orientation angles. We used HI absorption data to constrain the physical nature of FIR/HI filaments and determine spin temperatures and volume densities of FIR/HI filaments. HI filaments exist as CNM structures; outside the filaments no CNM absorption is detectable. The CNM in the diffuse ISM is exclusively located in filaments with FIR counterparts. These filaments at high Galactic latitudes exist as cold density structures; velocity crowding effects are negligible.
#### The Sonified Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the physical properties of stars, and putting these properties into the context of stellar evolution, is a core challenge in astronomical research. A key visualization in studying stellar evolution is the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD), organizing data about stellar luminosity and colour into a form that is informative about stellar structure and evolution. However, connecting the HRD with other sources of information, including stellar time series, is an outstanding challenge. Here we present a new method to turn stellar time series into sound. This method encodes physically meaningful features such that auditory comparisons between sonifications of different stars preserve astrophysical differences between them. We present an interactive multimedia version of the HRD that combines both visual and auditory components and that allows exploration of different types of stars both on and off the main sequence through both visual and auditory media.
#### Elusive hot stripped helium stars in the Galaxy I. Evolutionary stellar  models in the gap between subdwarfs and Wolf-Rayet stars

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar evolution theory predicts the existence of He-core remnants of the primary components of intermediate-mass close binaries that lost most of their H/He envelopes due to the mass exchange. They are expected to be observed as (1-7) solar mass hot He-rich stars located in the HRD between sdO/B and WR-stars. Several thousands of such stars are expected to exist in the Galaxy, but none of them have been identified so far. We aim to provide comprehensive predictions of the numbers and fundamental properties of He-stars and their companions in the Galaxy. This is a necessary first step to guide observations, to enable a comparison between evolutionary models and observed populations, and to determine the feedback of He-stars in the Galaxy. We expanded the previously considered space of parameters describing progenitors of He-stars and applied a population synthesis based on a grid of models computed by the code MESA. The estimated number of Galactic binaries hosting (1-7) solar mass He-stars is about 20000; it declines to about 3000 for mass exceeding two solar ones. The decisive factor that defines the number of He-stars is runaway mass loss after Roche lobe overflow by primary components, resulting in formation of common envelopes and merger of components. He-stars are much less numerous than expected, since a fraction of close binaries with primary masses below (5-7) solar ones produce subdwarfs with masses below solar. Overwhelming majority of He-stars reside in binaries with an early-type companions and can be identified neither by the UV excess nor by emission features. The large periods of a significant fraction of binaries hosting stripped stars (exceeding several hundred days) also hamper their discovery. (Abridged).

 - **Abstract**
 We have used data from the Outer Galaxy High-Resolution Survey (OGHReS) to refine the velocities, distances, and physical properties of a large sample of 3584 clumps detected in far infrared/submillimetre emission in the HiGAL survey located in the $\ell = 250^\circ-280^\circ$ region of the Galactic plane. Using $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO spectra, we have determined reliable velocities to 3412 clumps (95% of the sample). In comparison to the velocities from the HiGAL catalogue, we find good agreement for 80% of the sample (within 5 km/s). Using the higher resolution and sensitivity of OGHReS has allowed us to correct the velocity for 632 clumps and provide velocities for 687 clumps for which no velocity had been previously allocated. The velocities are used with a rotation curve to refine the distances to the clumps and to calculate the clumps' properties using a distance-dependent gas-to-dust ratio. We have determined reliable physical parameters for 3200 outer Galaxy dense clumps (~90% of the HiGAL sources in the region). We find a trend of decreasing luminosity-to-mass ratio with increasing Galactocentric distance, suggesting the star formation efficiency is lower in the outer Galaxy or that it is resulting in more lower mass stars than in the inner Galaxy. We also find a similar surface density for protostellar clumps located in the inner and outer Galaxy, revealing that the surface density requirements for star formation are the same across the Galactic disc.
