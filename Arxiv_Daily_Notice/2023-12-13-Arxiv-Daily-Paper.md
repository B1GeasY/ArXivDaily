#### On the effects of photoionization feedback on second-generation star  formation in globular clusters of different masses

 - **Abstract**
 We simulate the formation of second-generation stars in young clusters with masses of $10^{5}$ and $10^6\ {\rm M_\odot}$ within $30-100\ {\rm Myr}$ after the formation of clusters. We assume the clusters move through a uniform interstellar medium with gas densities of $10^{-24}$ and $10^{-23}\ {\rm gcm}^{-3} $ and consider the stellar winds from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, gas accretion onto the cluster, ram pressure, star formation, and photoionization feedback of our stellar systems including binary stars. We find that second-generation (SG) stars can be formed only within the $10^6\ {\rm M_\odot}$ cluster in the high-density simulation, where the cluster can accrete sufficient pristine gas from their surrounding medium, leading to efficient cooling required for the ignition of SG formation and sufficient dilution of the AGB ejecta. Hence, our results indicate that a denser environment is another requirement for the AGB scenario to explain the presence of multiple populations in globular clusters. On the other hand, the ionizing feedback becomes effective in heating the gas in our low-density simulations. As a result, the clusters cannot accumulate a considerable amount of pristine gas at their center. The gas mass within the clusters in these simulations is similar to that in young massive clusters (YMCs). Hence, our studies can provide a possible reason for the lack of gas, star formation, and SG stars in YMCs. Our results indicate that the ionizing stellar feedback is not a severe problem for SG formation; rather, it can help the AGB scenario to account for some observables.
#### Signatures of Small-scale Structure of the Pre-reionization  Intergalactic Medium in $z\gtrsim7$ Quasar Proximity Zones

 - **Abstract**
 The small-scale structure of baryons in the intergalactic medium is intimately linked to their past thermal history. Prior to the $\gtrsim10^4$ K photoheating during the epoch of reionization, cold baryons may have closely traced the clumpy cosmic web of dark matter down to scales as low as $\lesssim1$ comoving kpc, depending on the degree of heating by the X-ray background. After the passage of the ionization front, this clumpy structure can persist for $\sim10^{8}$ years. The strong Ly$\alpha$ damping wings detected towards a few of the highest redshift quasars, in addition to their smaller-than-expected Ly$\alpha$-transmissive proximity zones, suggest that they have ionized and heated the foreground intergalactic medium less than $10^7$ years ago. Signatures of the pre-reionization small-scale structure should thus persist in their intergalactic surroundings. Here we explore how the persistence of this clumpy structure can affect the statistics of Ly$\alpha$ transmission inside the transparent proximity zones of $z\gtrsim7$ quasars by post-processing a suite of small-volume hydrodynamical simulations with 1D ionizing radiative transfer. We find that the Ly$\alpha$ flux power spectrum and flux PDF statistics of ten $z=7.5$ proximity zones, with realistic observational parameters, could distinguish the gaseous structure of a $T_{\rm IGM}\sim2$ K CDM model from warm dark matter models with particle masses $m_{\rm WDM}>10$ keV and X-ray heated models with $f_{\rm X}f_{\rm abs}>0.1$ ($T_{\rm IGM}(z=7.5)\gtrsim275$ K) at the $2\sigma$ level.
#### OGLE-BLAP-009 -- A Case Study for the Properties and Evolution of Blue  Large-Amplitude Pulsators

 - **Abstract**
 Blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) make up a rare class of hot pulsating stars with effective temperatures of $\approx$30,000 K and surface gravities of 4.0 - 5.0 dex (cgs). The evolutionary origin and current status of BLAPs is not well understood, largely based on a lack of spectroscopic observations and no available mass constraints. However, several theoretical models have been proposed that reproduce their observed properties, including studies that identify them as pulsating helium-core pre-white dwarfs (He-core pre-WDs). We present here follow-up high-speed photometry and phase-resolved spectroscopy of one of the original 14 BLAPs, OGLE-BLAP-009, discovered during the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. We aim to explore its pulsation characteristics and determine stellar properties such as mass and radius in order to test the consistency of these results with He-core pre-WD models. Using the mean atmospheric parameters found using spectroscopy, we fit a spectral energy distribution to obtain a preliminary estimate of the radius, luminosity and mass by making use of the Gaia parallax. We then compare the consistency of these results to He-core pre-WD models generated using MESA, with predicted pulsation periods implemented using GYRE. We find that our mass constraints are in agreement with a low-mass He-core pre-WD of $\approx$0.30 M$_{\odot}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Organic features lead to two distinct types of Class 0/I low-mass protostars: hot corino sources, and warm carbon-chain chemistry (WCCC) sources. Some observations suggest that the chemical variations between WCCC sources and hot corino sources are associated with local environments, as well as the luminosity of protostars. We conducted gas-grain chemical simulation in collapsing protostellar cores, and found that the fiducial model predicts abundant carbon-chain molecules and COMs, and reproduces WCCC and hot corino chemistry in the hybrid source L483. By changing values of some physical parameters, including the visual extinction of ambient clouds ($A_{\rm V}^{\rm amb}$), the cosmic-ray ionization rate ($\zeta$), the maximum temperature during the warm-up phase ($T_{\rm max}$), and the contraction timescale of protostars ($t_{\rm cont}$), we found that UV photons and cosmic rays can boost WCCC features by accelerating the dissociation of CO and CH$_4$ molecules. On the other hand, UV photons can weaken the hot corino chemistry by photodissociation reactions, while the dependence of hot corino chemistry on cosmic rays is relatively complex. The $T_{\rm max}$ does not affect WCCC features, while it can influence hot corino chemistry by changing the effective duration of two-body surface reactions for most COMs. The long $t_{\rm cont}$ can boost WCCC and hot corino chemistry, by prolonging the effective duration of WCCC reactions in the gas phase and surface formation reactions for COMs, respectively. Subsequently, we ran a model with different physical parameters to reproduce scarce COMs in prototypical WCCC sources. The scarcity of COMs in prototypical WCCC sources can be explained by insufficient dust temperature in the inner envelopes to activate hot corino chemistry. Meanwhile, the High $\zeta$ and the long $t_{\rm cont}$ favors the explanation for scarce COMs in these sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Observational breakthroughs in the exoplanet field of the last decade motivated the development of numerous theoretical models describing atmospheres and mass loss, which is believed to be one of the main drivers of planetary evolution. We aim to outline for which types of close-in planets in the Neptune-mass range the accurate treatment of photoionisation effects is most relevant concerning atmospheric escape and the parameters relevant for interpreting observations. We developed the CHAIN (Cloudy e Hydro Ancora INsieme) model combining 1D hydrodynamic upper atmosphere model with the non-LTE photoionisation and radiative transfer code Cloudy accounting for photochemistry, detailed atomic level populations, and chemical reactions for all elements up to zinc. We apply CHAIN to model the upper atmospheres of a range of Neptune-like planets with masses between 1 and 50 M$_{\oplus}$, varying also the orbital parameters. For the majority of warm and hot Neptunes, we find slower and denser outflows, with lower ion fractions, compared to the predictions of the hydrodynamic model alone. Furthermore, we find significantly different temperature profiles between CHAIN and the hydrodynamic model alone, though the peak values are similar for similar atmospheric compositions. The mass-loss rates predicted by CHAIN are higher for hot, strongly irradiated planets and lower for more moderate planets. All differences between the two models are strongly correlated with the amount of high-energy irradiation. Finally, we find that the hydrodynamic effects impact significantly ionisation and heating. The impact of the precise photoionisation treatment provided by Cloudy strongly depends on the system parameters. This suggests that some of the simplifications typically employed in hydrodynamic modelling might lead to systematic errors when studying planetary atmospheres, even at a population-wide level.

 - **Abstract**
 Non-linear structure formation for fermionic dark matter particles leads to dark matter density profiles with a degenerate compact core surrounded by a diluted halo. For a given fermion mass, the core has a critical mass that collapses into a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Galactic dynamics constraints suggest a $\sim 100$ keV/$c^2$ fermion, which leads to $\sim 10^7 M_\odot$ critical core mass. Here, we show that baryonic (ordinary) matter accretion drives an initially stable dark matter core to SMBH formation and determine the accreted mass threshold that induces it. Baryonic gas density $\rho_b$ and velocity $v_b$ inferred from cosmological hydro-simulations and observations produce sub-Eddington accretion rates triggering the baryon-induced collapse in less than a Gyr. This process produces active galactic nuclei in galaxy mergers and the high-redshift Universe. For TXS 2116-077, merging with a nearby galaxy, the observed $3\times 10^7 M_\odot$ SMBH, for $Q_b = \rho_b/v_b^3 = 0.125 M_\odot/(100 \text{km/s pc})^3$, forms in $\approx 0.6$ Gyr, consistent with the $0.5$-$2$ Gyr merger timescale and younger jet. For the farthest central SMBH detected by the \textit{Chandra} X-ray satellite in the $z=10.3$ UHZ1 galaxy observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (\textit{JWST}), the mechanism leads to a $4\times 10^7 M_\odot$ SMBH in $87$-$187$ Myr, starting the accretion at $z=12$-$15$. The baryon-induced collapse can also explain the $\approx 10^7$-$10^8 M_\odot$ SMBHs revealed by the JWST at $z\approx 4$-$6$. After its formation, the SMBH can grow to a few $10^9 M_\odot$ in timescales shorter than a Gyr via sub-Eddington baryonic mass accretion.
