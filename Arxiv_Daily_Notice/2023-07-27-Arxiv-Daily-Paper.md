 - **Abstract**
 Direct imaging observations of planets revealed that wide-orbit ($>10$ au) giant planets exist even around subsolar-metallicity host stars and do not require metal-rich environments for their formation. A possible formation mechanism of wide-orbit giant planets in subsolar-metallicity environments is the gravitational fragmentation of massive protoplanetary discs. Here, we follow the long-term evolution of the disc for 1 Myr after its formation, which is comparable to disc lifetime, by way of a two-dimensional thin-disc hydrodynamic simulation with the metallicity of 0.1 ${\rm Z}_{\odot}$. We find a giant protoplanet that survives until the end of the simulation. The protoplanet is formed by the merger of two gaseous clumps at $\sim$0.5 Myr after disc formation, and then it orbits $\sim$200 au from the host star for $\sim$0.5 Myr. The protoplanet's mass is $\sim$10 ${\rm M}_{\rm J}$ at birth and gradually decreases to 1 ${\rm M}_{\rm J}$ due to the tidal effect from the host star. The result provides the minimum mass of 1 ${\rm M}_{\rm J}$ for protoplanets formed by gravitational instability in a subsolar-metallicity disc. We anticipate that the mass of a protoplanet experiencing reduced mass loss thanks to the protoplanetary contraction in higher resolution simulations can increase to $\sim$10 ${\rm M}_{\rm J}$. We argue that the disc gravitational fragmentation would be a promising pathway to form wide-orbit giant planets with masses of $\ge1$ ${\rm M}_{\rm J}$ in subsolar-metallicity environments.
#### A systematic study of the connection between white dwarf period spectra  and model structure

 - **Abstract**
 To date, pulsational variability has been measured from nearly 70 DBVs and 500 DAVs, with only a fraction of these having been the subjects of asteroseismic analysis. One way to approach white dwarf asteroseismology is forward modeling, where one assumes an interior structure and calculates the model's periods. Many such models are calculated, in the search for the one that best matches an observed period spectrum. It is not computationaly manageable, nor necessary, to vary every possible parameter for every object. We engage in a systematic study, based on a sample of 14 hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs, chosen to be representative of the types of pulsation spectra we encounter in white dwarf asteroseismology. These white dwarfs are modeled with carbon and oxygen cores . Our goal is to draw a connection between the period spectra and what parameters they are most sensitive to. We find that the presence of longer period modes generally muddies the mass and effective temperature determinations, unless continuous sequences of l = 1 and l = 2 modes are present. All period spectra are sensitive to structure in the helium and hydrogen envelope and most to at least some fatures of the oxygen abundance profile. Such sensitivity can be achieved either by the presence of specific low radial overtone modes, or by the presence of longer period modes. Convective efficiency only matters when fitting periods greater than 800 s. The results of this study can be used to inform parameter selection and pave the way to pipeline asteroseismic fitting of white dwarfs.
#### Flow of gas detected from beyond the filaments to protostellar scales in  Barnard 5

 - **Abstract**
 Infall of gas from outside natal cores has proven to feed protostars after the main accretion phase (Class 0). This changes our view of star formation to a picture that includes asymmetric accretion (streamers), and a larger role of the environment. However, the connection between streamers and the filaments that prevail in star-forming regions is unknown. We investigate the flow of material toward the filaments within Barnard 5 (B5) and the infall from the envelope to the protostellar disk of the embedded protostar B5-IRS1. Our goal is to follow the flow of material from the larger, dense core scale, to the protostellar disk scale. We present new HC$_3$N line data from the NOEMA and 30m telescopes covering the coherence zone of B5, together with ALMA H$_2$CO and C$^{18}$O maps toward the protostellar envelope. We fit multiple Gaussian components to the lines so as to decompose their individual physical components. We investigate the HC$_3$N velocity gradients to determine the direction of chemically-fresh gas flow. At envelope scales, we use a clustering algorithm to disentangle the different kinematic components within H$_2$CO emission. At dense core scales, HC$_3$N traces the infall from the B5 region toward the filaments. HC$_3$N velocity gradients are consistent with accretion toward the filament spines plus flow along them. We found a $\sim2800$ au streamer in H$_2$CO emission which is blueshifted with respect to the protostar and deposits gas at outer disk scales. The strongest velocity gradients at large scales curve toward the position of the streamer at small scales, suggesting a connection between both flows. Our analysis suggests that the gas can flow from the dense core to the protostar. This implies that the mass available for a protostar is not limited to its envelope, and can receiving chemically-unprocessed gas after the main accretion phase.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we analyse the metallicity structure of the Magellanic Clouds using parameters derived from the Gaia DR3 low-resolution XP spectra, astrometry and photometry. We find that the qualitative behavior of the radial metallicity gradients in the LMC and SMC are quite similar, with both of them having a metallicity plateau at intermediate radii and a second at larger radii. The LMC has a first metallicity plateau at [Fe/H]$\approx$-0.8 for 3$-$7\degr, while the SMC has one at [Fe/H]$\approx$-1.1 at 3$-$5\degr. The outer LMC periphery has a fairly constant metallicity of [Fe/H]$\approx$-1.0 (10$-$18\degr), while the outer SMC periphery has a value of [Fe/H]$\approx$-1.3 (6$-$10\degr). The sharp drop in metallicity in the LMC at $\sim$8\dgr and the marked difference in age distributions in these two regions suggests that there were two important evolutionary phases in the LMC. In addition, we find that the Magellanic periphery substructures, likely Magellanic debris, are mostly dominated by LMC material stripped off in old interactions with the SMC. This presents a new picture in contrast with the popular belief that the debris around the Clouds had been mostly stripped off from the SMC due to having a lower mass. We perform a detailed analysis for each known substructure and identify its potential origin based on metallicities and motions with respect to each galaxy.
