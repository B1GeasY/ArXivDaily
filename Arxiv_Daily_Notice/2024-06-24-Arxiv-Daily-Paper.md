 - **Abstract**
 Context. The scale height of the spatial distribution of open clusters (OCs) in the Milky Way exhibits a well known increase with age which is usually interpreted as evidence for dynamical heating of the disc or of the disc having been thicker in the past. Aims. We address the increase of the scale height with age of the OC population from a different angle. We propose that the apparent thickening of the disc can be largely explained as a consequence of a stronger disruption of OCs near the Galactic plane by disc phenomena, namely encounters with giant molecular clouds (GMCs). Methods. We present a computational model that forms OCs with different initial masses and follows their orbits while subjecting them to different disruption mechanisms. To setup the model and infer its parameters, we use and analyse a Gaia-based OC catalogue (Dias et al. 2021). We investigate both the spatial and age distributions of the OC population and discuss the completeness of the sample. The simulation results are then compared to the observations. Results. Consistent with previous studies, the observations reveal that the SH of the spatial distribution of OCs increases with age. We find that it is very likely that the OC sample is incomplete even for the solar neighbourhood. The model simulations successfully reproduce the SH increase with age and the total number of OCs that survive with age up to 1 Gyr. For older OCs, the predicted SH from the model starts deviating from the observations, although remaining within the uncertainties of the observations. This can be related with effects of incompleteness and/or simplifications in the model. Conclusions. A selective disruption of OCs near the galactic plane through GMC encounters is able to explain the SH evolution of the OC population.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on ALMA observations of polarized dust emission at 1.2 mm from NGC6334I, a source known for its significant flux outbursts. Between five months, our data show no substantial change in total intensity and a modest 8\% variation in linear polarization, suggesting a phase of stability or the conclusion of the outburst. The magnetic field, inferred from this polarized emission, displays a predominantly radial pattern from North-West to South-East with intricate disturbances across major cores, hinting at spiral structures. Energy analysis of CS$(J=5 \rightarrow 4)$ emission yields an outflow energy of approximately $3.5\times10^{45}$ ergs, aligning with previous interferometric studies. Utilizing the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, we determined magnetic field strengths ranging from 1 to 11 mG, averaging at 1.9 mG. This average increases to 4 $\pm 1$ mG when incorporating Zeeman measurements. Comparative analyses using gravitational, thermal, and kinetic energy maps reveal that magnetic energy is significantly weaker, possibly explaining the observed field morphology. We also find that the energy in the outflows and the expanding cometary {\HII} region is also larger than the magnetic energy, suggesting that protostellar feedback maybe the dominant driver behind the injection of turbulence in NGC6334I at the scales sampled by our data. The gas in NGC6334I predominantly exhibits supersonic and trans-Alfvenic conditions, transitioning towards a super-Alfvenic regime, underscoring a diminished influence of the magnetic field with increasing gas density. These observations are in agreement with prior polarization studies at 220 GHz, enriching our understanding of the dynamic processes in high-mass star-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present a new mosaic created with the second release of LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey data (LoTSS-DR2), which probes polarised synchrotron emission in the high-latitude inner Galaxy. Our objective is to characterise the observed emission through multi-tracer analysis to better understand the volume and the structures that may be observed with LOFAR. Furthermore, we exploit Faraday depth as a unique tool to probe the diffuse magnetised structure in the local ISM. We produced a mosaic Faraday cube of LoTSS-DR2 data by applying a rotation measure synthesis algorithm. From the cube, we constructed Faraday moment maps to characterise the nature of spectra. Additionally, we quantified the linear depolarisation canals using the Rolling Hough transform and used them to search for alignment with other data sets. Utilising LoTSS-DR2 observations alongside complementary data sets including Planck polarisation data, HI emission maps, and starlight polarisation measurements, we estimated the distance to the Faraday structures. The Faraday cube reveals an ordered structure across two-thirds of the observed area, whose orientation aligns well with that of both the HI filaments and the magnetic field. We estimate the minimum distance to the Faraday structures to be between 40 and 80 pc, which puts them in the vicinity of the Local Bubble wall. The emission is organised in a large gradient in Faraday depth whose origin we associate with the curved wall of the Local Bubble. Comparing our data with a model of the Local Bubble wall, we conclude that we might be probing a contribution of the medium inside the Local Bubble cavity as well, corresponding to the complex of local interstellar clouds. Moreover, we propose a toy model incorporating an ionised front of finite thickness into the Local Bubble wall, as a curved, cold neutral shell alone is insufficient to produce the observed gradient.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical makeup of our solar system is a reflection of Galactic chemical evolution in the local interstellar medium (ISM) over the past ~9 Ga before the formation of the solar system. Although the incorporated ISM dust was mostly destroyed during the solar system formation, a small fraction of the ISM dust, known as presolar grains, is preserved in pristine extraterrestrial materials and identified through their exotic isotopic compositions, pointing to their formation in gas outflows or explosions of ancient stars. Since their stellar birth at more than 4.6 Ga, presolar grains have borne witness to a diverse array of astrophysical and cosmochemical processes. In this chapter, I will review recent progress in utilizing the isotopic and structural compositions of presolar grains to constrain physical mixing processes and dust formation in stars, stellar nucleosynthesis, ISM processes, and the origin and evolution of the solar system.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from the occultation of Betelgeuse by asteroid (319) Leona on December 12, 2023, observed using a 64x64 pixel Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) array mounted on a 10-inch telescope at the AstroCamp Observatory in Nerpio, Southeast of Spain, just a few kilometers from the center of the occultation shadow path. This study highlights remarkable advancements in applying SPAD technology in astronomy. The SPAD array's asynchronous readout capacity and photon-counting timestamp mode enabled a temporal resolution of 1 microsecond in our light curve observations of Betelgeuse. Our data analysis addressed challenges inherent to SPAD arrays, such as optical cross-talk and afterpulses, which typically cause the photon statistics to deviate from a Poisson distribution. By adopting a generalized negative binomial distribution for photon statistics, we accurately describe the observational data. This method yielded an optical cross-talk estimation of 1.07% in our SPAD array and confirmed a negligible impact of spurious detected events due to afterpulses. The meticulous statistical examination of photon data underscores our SPAD-array's exceptional performance in conducting precise astronomical observations. The observations revealed a major decrease in Betelgeuse's intensity by 77.78% at the occultation's peak, allowing us to measure Betelgeuse's angular diameter at 57.26 mas in the SDSS g-band. This measurement, employing a simplified occultation model and considering the known properties of Leona, demonstrates the potential of SPAD technology for astronomy and sets a new standard for observing ultra-rapid transient celestial events, providing a valuable public dataset for the astronomical community.

 - **Abstract**
 Relating different global neutron-star (NS) properties, such as tidal deformability and radius, or mass and radius, requires an equation of state (EoS). Determining the NS EoS is therefore not only the science goal of a variety of observational projects, but it also enters in the analysis process; for example, to predict a NS radius from a measured tidal deformability via gravitational waves (GW) during the inspiral of a binary NS merger. To this aim, it is important to estimate the theoretical uncertainties on the EoS, one of which is the possible bias coming from an inconsistent treatment of the low-density region; that is, the use of a so called non-unified NS crust. We propose a numerical tool allowing the user to consistently match a nuclear-physics informed crust to an arbitrary high-density EoS describing the core of the star. We introduce an inversion procedure of the EoS close to saturation density that allows users to extract nuclear-matter parameters and extend the EoS to lower densities in a consistent way. For the treatment of inhomogeneous matter in the crust, a standard approach based on the compressible liquid-drop (CLD) model approach was used in our work. A Bayesian analysis using a parametric agnostic EoS representation in the high-density region is also presented in order to quantify the uncertainties induced by an inconsistent treatment of the crust. We show that the use of a fixed, realistic-but-inconsistent model for the crust causes small but avoidable errors in the estimation of global NS properties and leads to an underestimation of the uncertainties in the inference of NS properties. Our results highlight the importance of employing a consistent EoS in inference schemes. The numerical tool that we developed to reconstruct such a thermodynamically consistent EoS, CUTER, has been tested and validated for use by the astrophysical community.
#### A computational model for irradiance on close-in planetary systems

 - **Abstract**
 There is something about inverse-square laws that makes them fail at extremities. The inverse-square law, which is used commonly in studying the irradiance on exoplanets fails at the extreme case of planets closer than 0.01 AU. Therefore, in order to correctly predict possible climate states of such systems, we need a new model which accurately calculates angles subtended by various surface elements and integrate the generalized equation. A direct consequence of such a model is the shift of the terminator about 20 degrees beyond the poles. The irradiance at the poles is about 100-200 kW/m2 higher than what is predicted by the inverse-square law. This work therefore becomes crucial because it underscores the need to modify the current GCM models. The error in the numerical integration values of irradiance is less than one percent making our estimate very reliable.

 - **Abstract**
 Palaeomagnetic evidence shows that the behaviour of the geodynamo has changed during geological times. Variations in the heat flux at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) due to mantle convection could be responsible. Previous studies, based on unrealistically viscous dynamo simulations, have shown that large-scale CMB heat flux heterogeneities impact the magnetic dipole stability. To better understand how they affect the geodynamo, we used several simulations, ranging from standard numerical dynamos to more extreme parameters, including strong-field cases and turbulent cases. We show that heterogeneities with realistic amplitudes can favour a multipolar dynamo by either forcing equatorially antisymmetric zonal flows or eastward zonal flows. Strong-field dynamo models are found to be less sensitive, due to significant westward flows. We also find that the dipolar fraction of the magnetic field is best captured by $M^*=M\ E_{\eta}\ \dfrac{l_c}{\pi}$ where $M$ is the magnetic to kinetic energy ratio, $E_{\eta}$ is the magnetic Ekman number, and $l_c$ is the dominant harmonic degree of the flow, with multipolar dynamos found at lower $M^*$. $M^*$ estimated for the Earth's core is consistent with a reversing dipolar magnetic field. Within the range of $M^*$ susceptible to reversals, breaking the equatorial symmetry or forcing eastward zonal flows in our simulations consistently triggers reversals or a transition towards multipolar dynamos. Our results support that time variations of heat-flux heterogeneities driven by mantle convection through Earth's history are capable of inducing the significant variations in the reversal frequency observed in the palaeomagnetic record.

 - **Abstract**
 LHS 1140 b is the second-closest temperate transiting planet to the Earth with an equilibrium temperature low enough to support surface liquid water. At 1.730$\pm$0.025 R$_\oplus$, LHS 1140 b falls within the radius valley separating H$_2$-rich mini-Neptunes from rocky super-Earths. Recent mass and radius revisions indicate a bulk density significantly lower than expected for an Earth-like rocky interior, suggesting that LHS 1140 b could either be a mini-Neptune with a small envelope of hydrogen ($\sim$0.1% by mass) or a water world (9--19% water by mass). Atmospheric characterization through transmission spectroscopy can readily discern between these two scenarios. Here, we present two JWST/NIRISS transit observations of LHS 1140 b, one of which captures a serendipitous transit of LHS 1140 c. The combined transmission spectrum of LHS 1140 b shows a telltale spectral signature of unocculted faculae (5.8 $\sigma$), covering $\sim$20% of the visible stellar surface. Besides faculae, our spectral retrieval analysis reveals tentative evidence of residual spectral features, best-fit by Rayleigh scattering from an N$_2$-dominated atmosphere (2.3 $\sigma$), irrespective of the consideration of atmospheric hazes. We also show through Global Climate Models (GCM) that H$_2$-rich atmospheres of various compositions (100$\times$, 300$\times$, 1000$\times$solar metallicity) are ruled out to $>$10 $\sigma$. The GCM calculations predict that water clouds form below the transit photosphere, limiting their impact on transmission data. Our observations suggest that LHS 1140 b is either airless or, more likely, surrounded by an atmosphere with a high mean molecular weight. Our tentative evidence of an N$_2$-rich atmosphere provides strong motivation for future transmission spectroscopy observations of LHS 1140 b.

 - **Abstract**
 The Fourier Domain Acceleration Search (FDAS) and Fourier Domain Jerk Search (FDJS) are proven matched filtering techniques for detecting binary pulsar signatures in time-domain radio astronomy datasets. Next generation radio telescopes such as the SPOTLIGHT project at the GMRT produce data at rates that mandate real-time processing, as storage of the entire captured dataset for subsequent offline processing is infeasible. The computational demands of FDAS and FDJS make them challenging to implement in real-time detection pipelines, requiring costly high performance computing facilities. To address this we propose Pulscan, an unmatched filtering approach which achieves order-of-magnitude improvements in runtime performance compared to FDAS whilst being able to detect both accelerated and some jerked binary pulsars. We profile the sensitivity of Pulscan using a distribution (N = 10,955) of synthetic binary pulsars and compare its performance with FDAS and FDJS. Our implementation of Pulscan includes an OpenMP version for multicore CPU acceleration, a version for heterogeneous CPU/GPU environments such as NVIDIA Grace Hopper, and a fully optimized NVIDIA GPU implementation for integration into an AstroAccelerate pipeline, which will be deployed in the SPOTLIGHT project at the GMRT. Our results demonstrate that unmatched filtering in Pulscan can serve as an efficient data reduction step, prioritizing datasets for further analysis and focusing human and subsequent computational resources on likely binary pulsar signatures.
#### Can cosmic rays explain the high ionisation rates in the Galactic Centre?

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.15260

 - **Abstract**
 The $\mathrm{H}_2$ ionisation rate in the Central Molecular Zone, located in the Galactic Centre region, is estimated to be $\zeta\sim2\times10^{-14}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, based on observations of H$_3^+$ lines. This value is 2-3 orders of magnitude larger than that measured anywhere else in the Galaxy. A high cosmic-ray density has been invoked to explain the unusually high ionisation rate. However, this excess is not seen in the $\gamma$-ray emission from this region, which is produced by high-energy cosmic rays. Therefore, an excess is expected only in the low-energy cosmic-ray spectrum. Here, we derive constraints on this hypothetical low-energy component in the cosmic-ray spectra and we question its plausibility. To do so, we solve numerically the cosmic-ray transport equation in the Central Molecular Zone, considering spatial diffusion, advection in the Galactic wind, reacceleration in the ambient turbulence, and energy losses due to interactions with matter and radiation in the interstellar medium. We derive stationary solutions under the assumption that cosmic rays are continuously injected by a source located in the Galactic Centre. The high-energy component in the cosmic-ray spectrum is then fitted to available $\gamma$-ray and radio data, and a steep low-energy component is added to the cosmic-ray spectrum to explain the large ionisation rates. We find that injection spectra of $p^{-7}$ for protons below $p_{enh,p}c\simeq780~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $p^{-5.2}$ for electrons below $p_{enh,e}c=1.5~\mathrm{GeV}$ are needed to reach the observed ionisation rates. This corresponds to an extremely large cosmic-ray power of the order $\sim10^{40-41}~\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ injected at the Galactic Centre. We conclude that cosmic rays alone can not explain the high ionisation rates in the Galactic Centre region.

 - **Abstract**
 The Dragonfly Spectral Line Mapper (DSLM) is a semi-autonomous, distributed-aperture based telescope design, featuring a modular setup of 120 Canon telephoto lenses, and equal numbers of ultra-narrowband filters, detectors, and other peripherals. Here we introduce the observatory software stack for this highly-distributed system. Its core is the Dragonfly Communication Protocol (DCP), a pure-Python hardware communication framework for standardized hardware interaction. On top of this are 120 REST-ful FastAPI web servers, hosted on Raspberry Pis attached to each unit, orchestrating command translation to the hardware and providing diagnostic feedback to a central control system running the global instrument control software. We discuss key features of this software suite, including docker containerization for environment management, class composition as a flexible framework for array commands, and a state machine algorithm which controls the telescope during autonomous observations.
