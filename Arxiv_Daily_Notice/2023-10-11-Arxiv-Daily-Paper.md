#### The Not-So Dramatic Effect of Advective Flows on Gas Accretion

 - **Abstract**
 Super-Earths and mini-Neptunes are the most common types of exoplanets discovered, yet the physical scenarios behind their formation are still debated. Standard core accretion models in gas-rich environment find that typical mini-Neptune mass planets would blow up into Jupiters before the underlying disk gas dissipates away. The injection of entropy from the protoplanetary disk into forming gaseous envelopes has recently been put forward as a mechanism to delay this runaway accretion, specifically at short orbital distances. Here, we reevaluate this line of reasoning by incorporating recycling flows of gas into a numerical one-dimensional thermodynamic model with more realistic equation of state and opacities and the thermal state of the advective flow. At 0.1 AU, unless these advective flows can penetrate below $\sim$0.2 of the planet's gravitational sphere of influence, the gas-to-core mass ratio (GCR) stays above $\sim$10% before the nebular disk dissipates which is still too large to explain the measured properties of mini-Neptunes, necessitating other gas-limiting processes such as late-time core assembly. The effect of entropy advection on gas accretion weakens even further at wider orbital separations. We present an updated scaling relation between GCR and the penetration depth of the advective flows which varies non-trivially with orbital distances, core masses and dusty vs.~dust-free opacity. We further demonstrate how measurements of planet mass distribution beyond $\sim$1 AU can be used to disambiguate between different formation conditions of gas-poor planets.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of planets orbiting at less than 1 au from their host star and less massive than Saturn in various exoplanetary systems revolutionized our theories of planetary formation. The fundamental question is whether these close-in low-mass planets could have formed in the inner disk interior to 1 au, or whether they formed further out in the planet-forming disk and migrated inward. Exploring the role of additional giant planets in these systems may help us to pinpoint their global formation and evolution. We searched for additional substellar companions by using direct imaging in systems known to host close-in small planets. The use of direct imaging complemented by radial velocity and astrometric detection limits enabled us to explore the giant planet and brown dwarf demographics around these hosts to investigate the potential connection between both populations. We carried out a direct imaging survey with VLT/SPHERE to look for outer giant planets and brown dwarf companions in 27 systems hosting close-in low-mass planets discovered by radial velocity. Our sample is composed of very nearby (<20pc) planetary systems, orbiting G-, K-, and M-type mature (0.5-10Gyr) stellar hosts. We performed homogeneous direct imaging data reduction and analysis to search for and characterize point sources, and derived robust statistical detection limits. Of 337 point-source detections, we do not find any new bound companions. We recovered the emblematic very cool T-type brown dwarf GJ229B. Our typical sensitivities in direct imaging range from 5 to 30 MJup beyond 2 au. The non-detection of massive companions is consistent with predictions based on models of planet formation by core accretion. Our pilot study opens the way to a multi-technique approach for the exploration of very nearby exoplanetary systems with future ground-based and space observatories.
#### NEATH II: N$_2$H$^+$ as a tracer of imminent star formation in quiescent  high-density gas

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation activity in molecular clouds is often found to be correlated with the amount of material above a column density threshold of $\sim 10^{22} \, {\rm cm^{-2}}$. Attempts to connect this column density threshold to a ${\it volume}$ density above which star formation can occur are limited by the fact that the volume density of gas is difficult to reliably measure from observations. We post-process hydrodynamical simulations of molecular clouds with a time-dependent chemical network, and investigate the connection between commonly-observed molecular species and star formation activity. We find that many molecules widely assumed to specifically trace the dense, star-forming component of molecular clouds (e.g. HCN, HCO$^+$, CS) actually also exist in substantial quantities in material only transiently enhanced in density, which will eventually return to a more diffuse state without forming any stars. By contrast, N$_2$H$^+$ only exists in detectable quantities above a volume density of $10^4 \, {\rm cm^{-3}}$, the point at which CO, which reacts destructively with N$_2$H$^+$, begins to deplete out of the gas phase onto grain surfaces. This density threshold for detectable quantities of N$_2$H$^+$ corresponds very closely to the volume density at which gas becomes irreversibly gravitationally bound in the simulations: the material traced by N$_2$H$^+$ never reverts to lower densities, and quiescent regions of molecular clouds with visible N$_2$H$^+$ emission are destined to eventually form stars. The N$_2$H$^+$ line intensity is likely to directly correlate with the star formation rate averaged over timescales of around a Myr.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the detection of a secondary outflow associated with a Class I source, Ser-emb 15, in the Serpens Molecular Cloud. We reveal two pairs of molecular outflows consisting of three lobes, namely primary and secondary outflows, using ALMA 12CO and SiO line observations at a resolution of 318 au. The secondary outflow is elongated approximately perpendicular to the axis of the primary outflow in the plane of the sky. We also identify two compact structures, Sources A and B, within an extended structure associated with Ser-emb 15 in the 1.3 mm continuum emission at a resolution of 40 au. The projected sizes of Sources A and B are 137 au and 60 au, respectively. Assuming a dust temperature of 20 K, we estimate the dust mass to be 0.0024 Msun for Source A and 0.00033 Msun for Source B. C18O line data imply the existence of rotational motion around the extended structure, however, cannot resolve rotational motion in Source A and/or B, due to insufficient angular and frequency resolutions. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether Ser-emb 15 is a single or binary system. Thus, either Source A or B could drive the secondary outflow. We discuss two scenarios to explain the driving mechanism of the primary and secondary outflows: the Ser-emb 15 system is (1) a binary system composed of Source A and B or (2) a single star system composed of only Source A. In either case, the system could be a suitable target for investigating the disk and/or binary formation processes in complicated environments. Detecting these outflows should contribute to understanding complex star-forming environments, which may be common in the star-formation processes.
#### Measuring the cosmological 21-cm dipole with 21-cm global experiments

 - **Abstract**
 A measurement of the 21-cm global signal would be a revealing probe of the Dark Ages, the era of first star formation, and the Epoch of Reionization. It has remained elusive owing to bright galactic and extra-galactic foreground contaminants, coupled with instrumental noise, ionospheric effects, and beam chromaticity. The simultaneous detection of a consistent 21-cm dipole signal alongside the 21-cm global signal would provide confidence in a claimed detection. We use simulated data to investigate the possibility of using drift-scan dipole antenna experiments to achieve a detection of both monopole and dipole. We find that at least two antennae located at different latitudes are required to localise the dipole. In the absence of foregrounds, a total integration time of $\sim 10^4$ hours is required to detect the dipole. With contamination by simple foregrounds, we find that the integration time required increases to $\sim 10^5$ hours. We show that the extraction of the 21-cm dipole from more realistic foregrounds requires a more sophisticated foreground modelling approach. Finally, we motivate a global network of dipole antennae that could reasonably detect the dipole in $\sim 10^3$ hours of integration time.

 - **Abstract**
 A detailed analysis of the Nuclear Stellar Cluster (NSC) concedes not only the existence of the Scluster with its fast-moving stars and the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. It also reveals an embedded region of gas and dust with an exceptionally high stellar density called IRS 13. The IRS 13 cluster can be divided into the northern and the eastern counterparts, called IRS 13N and IRS 13E, respectively. This work will focus on both regions and study their most prominent members using rich infrared and radio/submm data baselines. Applying a multiwavelength analysis enables us to determine a comprehensive photometric footprint of the investigated cluster sample. Using the raytracing-based radiative transfer model HYPERION, the spectral energy distribution of the IRS 13 members suggests a stellar nature of the dusty sources. These putative Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) have a comparable spectroscopic identification to the D and G sources in or near the S cluster. Furthermore, we report the existence of a population of dusty sources in IRS 13 that can be mostly identified in the H-, K-, and Lband. Together with the objects reported in literature, we propose that this population is the outcome of a recent star formation process. Furthermore, we report that these presumably young objects are arranged in a disk structure. Although it cannot be excluded that the intrinsic arrangement of IRS 13 does show a disk structure, we find indications that the investigated cluster sample might be related to the counterclockwise disk.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first preliminary results of the project \textit{ICED}, focusing on the face-on galaxy NGC4254. We use the millimetre maps observed with NIKA2 at IRAM-30m, as part of the IMEGIN Guaranteed Time Large Program, and of a wide collection of ancillary data (multi-wavelength photometry and gas phase spectral lines) that are publicly available. We derive the global and local properties of interstellar dust grains through infrared-to-radio spectral energy distribution fitting, using the hierarchical Bayesian code HerBIE, which includes the grain properties of the state-of-the-art dust model, THEMIS. Our method allows us to get the following dust parameters: dust mass, average interstellar radiation field, and fraction of small grains. Also, it is effective in retrieving the intrinsic correlations between dust parameters and interstellar medium properties. We find an evident anti-correlation between the interstellar radiation field and the fraction of small grains in the centre of NGC4254, meaning that, at strong radiation field intensities, very small amorphous carbon grains are efficiently destroyed by the ultra-violet photons coming from newly formed stars, through photo-desorption and sublimation. We observe a flattening of the anti-correlation at larger radial distances, which may be driven by the steep metallicity gradient measured in NGC4254.
#### Surface chemical composition of single WNh stars

 - **Abstract**
 Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars of the WNh category contain a significant fraction of hydrogen at their surface. They can be hydrogen-burning, very massive stars or stars in a post-main sequence phase of evolution. Also, WNh stars are sometimes not included in population synthesis models. We aim to better characterise the properties of single WNh stars in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. In particular, we want to constrain their surface chemistry beyond the hydrogen content by determining the helium, carbon, and nitrogen surface abundances. We perform a spectroscopic analysis of 22 single WNh stars. We fit their ultraviolet and/or optical spectra using synthetic spectra computed with the code CMFGEN. We determine the main stellar parameters (temperature, luminosity, mass-loss rates) and the surface H, He, C, and N mass fractions. We investigate the ability of current evolutionary models to reproduce all parameters at the same time. We find that all WNh stars show the signatures of CNO-cycle material at their surface: they are carbon-depleted and nitrogen-rich. A clear trend of higher nitrogen content at higher metallicity is observed, as expected. The amount of hydrogen (X) varies significantly from one star to another, independently of luminosity. Values of X larger than 0.4 are not exceptional. The majority of Galactic WNh stars can be explained by evolutionary models, provided sufficient fine-tuning of the input parameters of evolutionary calculations. At lower metallicity, most stars escape predictions from evolutionary models. This has been noted in the literature but constraints on the surface nitrogen content exacerbate this severe issue. Our study highlights the need to refine the treatment of WR stars in both stellar evolution and population synthesis models.
#### Quantifying the Effects of Known Unknowns on Inferred High-redshift  Galaxy Properties: Burstiness, the IMF, and Nebular Physics

 - **Abstract**
 The era of the James Webb Space Telescope ushers stellar populations models into uncharted territories, particularly at the high-redshift frontier. In a companion paper, we apply the \texttt{Prospector} Bayesian framework to jointly infer galaxy redshifts and stellar populations properties from broad-band photometry as part of the UNCOVER survey. Here we present a comprehensive error budget in spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. Using a $z_{\rm phot}>9$ sample, we quantify the systematic shifts stemming from various model choices in inferred stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and age. These choices encompass different timescales for changes in the star formation history (SFH), non-universal stellar initial mass functions (IMF), and the inclusion of variable nebular abundances, gas density and ionizing photon budget. We find that the IMF exerts the strongest influence on the inferred properties: the systematic uncertainties can be as much as 1 dex, 2--5 times larger than the formal reported uncertainties in mass and SFR; and importantly, exceed the scatter seen when using different SED fitting codes. This means that a common practice in the literature of assessing uncertainties in SED-fitting processes by comparing multiple codes is substantively underestimating the true systematic uncertainty. Highly stochastic SFHs change the inferred SFH by much larger than the formal uncertainties, and introduce $\sim 0.8$ dex systematics in SFR and $\sim 0.3$ dex systematics in average age. Finally, employing a flexible nebular emission model causes $\sim 0.2$ dex systematic increase in mass, comparable to the formal uncertainty. This paper constitutes one of the initial steps toward a complete uncertainty estimate in SED modeling.
#### 3D simulations of the Archean Earth including photochemical haze  profiles

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from 3D simulations of the Archean Earth including a prescribed (non-interactive) spherical haze generated through a 1D photochemical model. Our simulations suggest that a thin haze layer, formed when CH4/CO2 = 0.1, leads to global warming of ~10.6 K due to the change of water vapour and cloud feedback, compared to the simulation without any haze. However, a thicker haze layer, formed when CH4/CO2 > 0.1, leads to global cooling of up to ~65 K as the scattering and absorption of shortwave radiation from the haze reduces the radiation from reaching the planetary surface. A thermal inversion is formed with a lower tropopause as the CH4/CO2 ratio increases. The haze reaches an optical threshold thickness when CH4/CO2 ~ 0.175 beyond which the atmospheric structure and the global surface temperature do not vary much.
