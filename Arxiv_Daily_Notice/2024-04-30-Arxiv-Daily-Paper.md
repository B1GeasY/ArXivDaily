 - **Abstract**
 The nearby elliptical galaxy M87 contains one of the only two supermassive black holes whose emission surrounding the event horizon has been imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). In 2018, more than two dozen multi-wavelength (MWL) facilities (from radio to gamma-ray energies) took part in the second M87 EHT campaign. The goal of this extensive MWL campaign was to better understand the physics of the accreting black hole M87*, the relationship between the inflow and inner jets, and the high-energy particle acceleration. Understanding the complex astrophysics is also a necessary first step towards performing further tests of general relativity. The MWL campaign took place in April 2018, overlapping with the EHT M87* observations. We present a new, contemporaneous spectral energy distribution (SED) ranging from radio to very high energy (VHE) gamma-rays, as well as details of the individual observations and light curves. We also conduct phenomenological modelling to investigate the basic source properties. We present the first VHE gamma-ray flare from M87 detected since 2010. The flux above 350 GeV has more than doubled within a period of about 36 hours. We find that the X-ray flux is enhanced by about a factor of two compared to 2017, while the radio and millimetre core fluxes are consistent between 2017 and 2018. We detect evidence for a monotonically increasing jet position angle that corresponds to variations in the bright spot of the EHT image. Our results show the value of continued MWL monitoring together with precision imaging for addressing the origins of high-energy particle acceleration. While we cannot currently pinpoint the precise location where such acceleration takes place, the new VHE gamma-ray flare already presents a challenge to simple one-zone leptonic emission model approaches, and emphasises the need for combined image and spectral modelling.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiative transfer (RT) is a crucial ingredient for self-consistent modelling of numerous astrophysical phenomena across cosmic history. However, on-the-fly integration into radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations is computationally demanding, particularly due to the stringent time-stepping conditions and increased dimensionality inherent in multi-frequency collisionless Boltzmann physics. The emergence of exascale supercomputers, equipped with extensive CPU cores and GPU accelerators, offers new opportunities for enhancing RHD simulations. We present a novel optimization of AREPO-RT explicitly tailored for such high-performance computing environments. We implement a novel node-to-node communication strategy that utilizes shared memory to substitute intra-node communication with direct memory access. Furthermore, combining multiple inter-node messages into a single message substantially enhances network bandwidth utilization and performance for large-scale simulations on modern supercomputers. The single-message node-to-node approach also improves performance on smaller-scale machines with less optimized networks. Furthermore, by transitioning all RT-related calculations to GPUs, we achieve a significant computational speedup of around 15 for standard benchmarks compared to the original CPU implementation. As a case study, we perform cosmological RHD simulations of the Epoch of Reionization, employing a similar setup as the THESAN project. In this context, RT becomes sub-dominant such that even without modifying the core AREPO codebase, there is an overall threefold improvement in efficiency. The advancements presented here have broad implications, potentially transforming the complexity and scalability of future simulations for a wide variety of astrophysical studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerous models of neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) exist based on different superdense-matter physics approaches. Nevertheless, some NS properties show universal (EoS-independent) relations. Here, we propose a novel class of such universalities. Despite different physics inputs, a wide class of realistic nucleonic, hyperonic, and hybrid EoS models can be accurately described using only three parameters. For a given EoS, these are the mass and radius of the maximum-mass NS (or pressure and density in its center) and the radius of a half-maximum-mass star. With such a parametrization, we build universal analytic expressions for mass-radius and pressure-density relations. They form a semi-analytic mapping from the mass-radius relation to the EoS in NS cores (the so-called inverse Oppenheimer-Volkoff mapping). This mapping simplifies the process of inferring the EoS from observations of NS masses and radii. Applying it to current NS observations we set new limits on the high end of the EoS.

 - **Abstract**
 The Spectroscopic Investigation of Nebular Gas (SING) is a near-ultraviolet (NUV) low-resolution spectrograph payload designed to operate in the NUV range, 1400 $\unicode{x212B}$ -- 2700 $\unicode{x212B}$, from a stable space platform. SING telescope has a primary aperture of 298 mm, feeding the light to the long-slit UV spectrograph. SING has a field of view (FOV) of 1$^{\circ}$, achieving a spatial resolution of 1.33 arc minute and spectral resolution of 3.7 $\unicode{x212B}$ ($R\sim600$) at the central wavelength. SING employs a micro-channel plate (MCP) with a CMOS readout-based photon-counting detector. The instrument is designed to observe diffuse sources such as nebulae, supernova remnants, and the interstellar medium (ISM) to understand their chemistry. SING was selected by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs to be hosted on the Chinese Space Station. The instrument will undergo qualification tests as per the launch requirements. In this paper, we describe the hardware design, optomechanical assembly, and calibration of the instrument.
#### Effects of an Explicit Time-Dependent Radiation Pressure Force on  Trajectories of Primary Neutral Hydrogen in the Heliosphere

 - **Abstract**
 Radiation pressure exerted by solar photon output is salient to the motion of primary neutral hydrogen atoms streaming into the inner heliosphere directly from the Local Interstellar Medium (LISM). The action of a time-dependent radiation pressure force, when coupled with the usual gravitational force, changes the characteristic velocities, and therefore energies, of the atoms when they reach regions in which explorer probes are present. A study is presented that uses a 2D code to backtrace neutral hydrogen trajectories from representative target points located 1 au from the Sun. It makes use of both a radiation pressure function and a function for the photoionization rate at 1 au that oscillate with time based on measurements over a typical solar cycle, as well as a time-independent charge exchange ionization rate at 1 au. Assuming a Maxwellian distribution in the distant upwind direction, phase space data is calculated at the target points, at different moments in time. The dependence of the force on the radial particle velocity has been omitted in the analysis, such that the emphasis is on the effects of the global solar UV intensity variations through the solar cycle. This process allows for analysis of direct and indirect Maxwellian components through time and space in the time-dependent force environment. Additionally, pseudo-bound orbits caused by energy losses associated with this force environment are observed and their properties evaluated with the aim of determining their effects on potential measurements by explorer probes.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of high-dispersion spectroscopic observations of the symbiotic system R Aquarii (R Aqr) obtained with the Manchester Echelle Spectrograph (MES) at the 2.1 m telescope of the San Pedro M\'artir Observatory (Mexico). An interpretation of these data is presented by means of the shape software to disclose the morpho-kinematics of the nebulosities associated with R Aqr. The best model that reproduces narrow-band images and position-velocity diagrams is composed by three structures: an outer (large) hourglass structure surrounding an inner bipolar with a spiral-like filament entwined around the later. Different expansion velocity patterns are predefined for each structure, which predict kinematic ages of $\tau_{1}$=450$\pm$25 yr (outer hourglass), $\tau_{2}$=240$\pm$20 yr (inner bipolar) and $\tau_{3}$=215$\pm$20 yr (spiral-like filament). We suggest that the spiral-like filament is tracing the regions of interaction of the precessing jet with the circumstellar material, which simultaneously carves the inner bipolar structure. If a similar process created the large hourglass structure, it means that the action of the jet ceased for about 230 yr. We discuss the implication for other unresolved symbiotic systems detected in X-rays.
#### Multiline observations of hydrogen, helium, and carbon  radio-recombination lines toward Orion A: A detailed dynamical study and  direct determination of physical conditions

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of hydrogen, helium, and carbon millimeter-wave radio-recombination lines (RRLs) toward ten representative positions throughout the Orion Nebula complex, using the Yebes 40m telescope in the Q band (31.3 GHz to 50.6 GHz) at an angular resolution of about $45\arcsec$ ($\sim$0.09\,pc). The observed positions include the Orion Nebula (M42) with the Orion Molecular Core 1, M43, and the Orion Molecular Core 3 bordering on NGC 1973, 1975, and 1977. While hydrogen and helium RRLs arise in the ionized gas surrounding the massive stars in the Orion Nebula complex, carbon RRLs stem from the neutral gas of the adjacent photo-dissociation regions (PDRs). The high velocity resolution ($0.3\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$) enables us to discern the detailed dynamics of the RRL emitting neutral and ionized gas. We compare the carbon RRLs with SOFIA/upGREAT observations of the [CII] $158\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ line and IRAM 30m observations of the $^{13}$CO (J=2-1) line. Using the [CII] and [$^{13}$CII] intensities with the carbon RRL intensities, we can infer physical conditions (electron temperature and electron density) in the PDR gas using non-LTE excitation models. Our observations are sensitive enough to detect faint lines toward two positions in OMC1, that may be attributed to RRLs of C$^+$ or O$^+$. In general, the RRL line widths of both the ionized and neutral gas, as well as the [CII] and $^{13}$CO line widths, are broader than thermal, indicating significant turbulence in the interstellar medium, which transitions from super-Alfv\'enic and subsonic in the ionized gas to sub-Alfv\'enic and supersonic in the molecular gas. At the scales probed by our observations, the turbulent pressure dominates the pressure balance in the neutral and molecular gas, while in the ionized gas the turbulent pressure is much smaller than the thermal pressure.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the serendipitous discovery of a $8' \times 12'$ emission shell brightest in [O III] centered on the X-ray binary B[e] star, CI Cameleopardalis (CI Cam). This shell, detected during a survey of optical emission associated with the Galactic supernova remnant G150.3+4.5, is seen outside but immediately adjacent to the remnant's optical filaments along its northwestern edge. Assuming this shell is related to CI Cam's strong winds and transient outbursts, the adoption of CI Cam's Gaia DR3 statistically corrected distance of 4.1$^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ kpc yields shell dimensions $\simeq$ 9.5 pc $\times$ 14.3 pc. While the distance to the G150.3+4.5 remnant is uncertain, the appearance of CI Cam's emission shell so close to the SNR's optical filaments appears likely to be a chance coincidence.

 - **Abstract**
 We summarize the current best polychromatic (10 to 20 % bandwidth) contrast performance demonstrated in the laboratory by different starlight suppression approaches and systems designed to directly characterize exoplanets around nearby stars. We present results obtained by internal coronagraph and external starshade experimental testbeds using entrance apertures equivalent to off-axis or on-axis telescopes, either monolithic or segmented. For a given angular separation and spectral bandwidth, the performance of each starlight suppression system is characterized by the values of raw contrast (before image processing), off-axis (exoplanet) core throughput, and post-calibration contrast (the final 1 sigma detection limit of off-axis point sources, after image processing). To place the current laboratory results in the perspective of the future Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) mission, we simulate visible observations of a fiducial Earth/Sun twin system at 12 pc, assuming a 6m (inscribed diameter) collecting aperture and a realistic end-to-end optical throughput. The exposure times required for broadband exoearth detection (20% bandwidth around a wavelength of 0.55 microns) and visible spectroscopic observations (R=70) are then computed assuming various levels of starlight suppression performance, including the values currently demonstrated in the laboratory. Using spectroscopic exposure time as a simple metric, our results point to key starlight suppression system design performance improvements and trades to be conducted in support of HWO exoplanet science capabilities. These trades may be explored via numerical studies, lab experiments, as well as high contrast space-based observations and demonstrations.

 - **Abstract**
 Current sheet is a common structure involved in solar eruptions. However, it is observed in minority of the events and the physical properties of its fine structures during a solar eruption are rarely investigated. Here, we report an on-disk observation that displays 108 compact, circular or elliptic bright structures, presumably plasma blobs, propagating bidirectionally along a flare current sheet during a period of $\sim$24 minutes. From extreme ultraviolet images, we have investigated the temporal variation of the blob number around the flare peak time. The current sheet connects the flare loops and the erupting filament. The width, duration, projected velocity, temperature, and density of these blobs are $\sim$1.7$\pm$0.5\,Mm, $\sim$79$\pm$57\,s, $\sim$191$\pm$81\,\kms, $\sim$10$^{6.4\pm0.1}$ K, and $\sim$10$^{10.1\pm0.3}$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively. The reconnection site rises with a velocity of $\leqslant$69\,\kms. The observational results suggest that plasmoid instability plays an important role in the energy release process of solar eruptions.

 - **Abstract**
 The decrease rate of dust mass due to strong shock waves ($v_s\geq 150$ km s$^{-1}$) from supernovae (SNe) estimated for the Milky Way interstellar medium significantly exceeds the overall production rate by both asymptotic giant branch stars and core collapse SNe. The interplay between the production and destruction rates is critically important for evaluation of the net dust outcome from SNe at different conditions. In light of this, we study the dynamics of initially polydisperse dust grains pre-existed in an ambient medium swept up the SN shock front depending on magnitude of inhomogeneity (clumpiness) in {the} medium. We find that dust destruction inside the bubble is inhibited in more inhomogeneous medium: the larger amount of dust survives for the higher dispersion of density. This trend is set by the interrelation between radiative gas cooling and dust sputtering in different environment. After several radiative times the mass fraction of the survived dust saturates at the level almost independent on the gas mean density. We note that for more clumpy medium the distributions of dust over thermal phases of a gas inside the bubble and over sizes are smoother and flatter in comparison with those in a nearly homogeneous medium.
#### Studies of stationary features in jets: BL Lacertae II. Trajectory  reversals and superluminal speeds on sub-parsec scales

 - **Abstract**
 High resolution VLBI observations revealed a quasi-stationary component (QSC) in the relativistic jets of many blazars, which represents a standing recollimation shock. The VLBA monitoring of the BL Lacertae jet at 15~GHz shows the QSC at a projected distance of about 0.26~mas from the radio core. We study the trajectory and kinematics of the QSC in BL Lacertae on sub-parsec scales using 15~GHz VLBA maps of 164 observations over 20 years from the MOJAVE program and 2~cm VLBA Survey. To reconstruct the QSC's intrinsic trajectory, we use moving average and trajectory refinement procedures to smooth out the effects of core displacement and account for QSC positioning errors. We identified 22 QSC reversal patterns on spatial scales ranging from 0.01~mas to 0.05~mas and with a frequency of $\sim 1.5$ per year. Most reversals have an acute angle $<90\degr$ at the turning point, and few have a loop-shaped or arc-shaped trajectory. The directions of reversals (clockwise or counterclockwise) appear to be random. Combinations of reversals show reversible and quasi-periodic motion. We propose a model in which the reverse motion of the QSC is due to the passage of a relativistic transverse jet wave through a fixed location of the QSC, similar to the transverse motion of a seagull on a wave. The QSC motion is governed by the amplitude, velocity, and tilt of the relativistic transverse wave. According to the model, relativistic waves are generated upstream of QSC. In the active state of the jet, the directions of the twisting waves are random, similar to the behaviour of the wave in a high-pressure hose, while in the jet stable state, the wave makes quasi-periodic oscillations with regular twisting. In this model the transverse speed of the QSC in the host galaxy frame is subluminal ($<0.3\,c$), but to an observer it appears superluminal ($\sim 2\,c$).

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar medium (ISM) is ubiquitously turbulent across many physically distinct environments within the Galaxy. Turbulence is key in controlling the structure and dynamics of the ISM, regulating star formation, and transporting metals within the Galaxy. We present the first observational measurements of turbulence in neutral hydrogen entrained in the hot nuclear wind of the Milky Way. Using recent MeerKAT observations of two extra-planar HI clouds above (gal. lat.$\,\sim7.0^{\circ}$) and below (gal. lat.$\,\sim-3.9^{\circ}$) the Galactic disc, we analyse centroid velocity and column density maps to estimate the velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{v,\mathrm{3D}}$), the turbulent sonic Mach number ($\mathcal{M}$), the volume density dispersion ($\sigma_{\rho/\rho_0}$), and the turbulence driving parameter ($b$). We also present a new prescription for estimating the spatial temperature variations of HI in the presence of related molecular gas. We measure these turbulence quantities on the global scale of each cloud, but also spatially map their variation across the plane-of-sky extent of each cloud by using a roving kernel method. We find that the two clouds share very similar characteristics of their internal turbulence, despite their varying latitudes. Both clouds are in the sub-to-trans-sonic Mach regime, and have primarily compressively-driven ($b\sim1$) turbulence. Given that there is no known active star-formation present in these clouds, this may be indicative of the way the cloud-wind interaction injects energy into the entrained atomic material on parsec scales.
#### Broad and Bi-directional narrow quasi-periodic fast-propagating wave  trains associated with a filament-driven halo CME on 2023 April 21

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents three distinct wave trains that occurred on 2023 April 21: a broad quasi-periodic fast-propagating (QFP) wave train and a bi-directional narrow QFP wave train. The broad QFP wave train expands outward in a circular wavefront, while bi-directional narrow QFP wave trains propagate in the northward and southward directions, respectively. The concurrent presence of the wave trains offers a remarkable opportunity to investigate their respective triggering mechanisms. Measurement shows that the broad QFP wave train's speed is 300- 1100 km/s in different propagating directions. There is a significant difference in the speed of the bi-directional narrow QFP wave trains: the southward propagation achieves 1400 km/s, while the northward propagation only reaches about 550 km/s accompanied by a deceleration of about 1- 2 kms-2. Using the wavelet analysis, we find that the periodicity of the propagating wave trains in the southward and northward directions closely matches the quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) exhibited by the flares. Based on these results, the narrow QFP wave trains were most likely excited by the intermittent energy release in the accompanying flare. In contrast, the broad QFP wave train had a tight relationship with the erupting filament, probably attributed to the unwinding motion of the erupting filament or the leakage of the fast sausage wave train inside the filament body.
#### Evolution of secondary electron spectrum during cosmic-ray discharge in  the universe

 - **Abstract**
 We recently found that streaming cosmic rays (CRs) induce a resistive electric field that can accelerate secondary electrons produced by CR ionization. In this work, we study the evolution of the energy spectrum of secondary electrons by numerically solving the one-dimensional Boltzmann equation and Ohm's law. We show that the accelerated secondary electrons further ionize a gas, that is, the electron avalanche occurs, resulting in increased ionization and excitation of the gas. Although the resistive electric field becomes weaker than one before the CR discharge, the weak resistive electric field weakly accelerates the secondary electrons. The quasi-steady state is almost independent of the initial resistive electric field, but depends on the electron fraction in the gas. The resistive electric field in the quasi-steady state is larger for the higher electron fraction, which makes the number of secondary electrons that can ionize the gas larger, resulting in a higher ionization rate. The CR discharge could explain the high ionization rate that are observed in some molecular clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 We compile the catalog of Hvar Observatory solar observations in the time period corresponding to regular digitally stored chromospheric and photospheric observations 2010-2019. We make basic characterisation of observed phenomena and compare them to catalogs which are based on full disc solar images. We compile a catalog of observed ARs consisting of 1100 entries, where each AR is classified according to McIntosh and Mt Wilson classifications. We find that HVAR observations are biased towards more frequently observing more complex ARs and observing them in longer time periods, likely related to the small FOV not encompassing the whole solar disc. In H$\alpha$ observations we catalog conspicuous filaments/prominences and flares. We characterise filaments according to their location, chirality (if possible) and eruptive signatures. Analysis of the eruptive filaments reveals a slight bias in HVAR catalog towards observation of partial eruptions, possibly related to the observers tendency to observe filament which already showed some activity. In the flare catalog we focus on their observed eruptive signatures (loops or ribbons) and their shape. In addition, we associate them to GOES soft X-ray flares to determine their corresponding class. We find that HVAR observations seem biased towards more frequently observing stronger flares and observing them in longer time periods. We demonstrate the feasibility of the catalog on a case study of the flare detected on 2 August 2011 in HVAR H$\alpha$ observations and related Sun-to-Earth phenomena. Through flare-CME-ICME association we demonstrate the agreement of remote and in situ properties. The data used for this study, as well as the catalog, are made publicly available.
#### The population of Galactic supernova remnants in the TeV range

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova remnants (SNRs) are likely to be significant sources of cosmic rays up to the knee of the local cosmic-ray (CR) spectrum. They produce gamma-rays in the very-high-energy (VHE) ($E>0.1$ TeV) range via: hadronic interactions with the interstellar medium and leptonic interactions with soft photons. Current observations have lead to the detection of about a dozen of VHE SNRs and future instruments should increase this number. The details of particle acceleration at SNRs, and of the mechanisms producing VHE gamma-rays at SNRs are poorly understood. We aim to study the population of SNRs detected in the TeV range and its properties, and to address fundamental questions of particle acceleration at SNR shocks: What is the spectrum of accelerated particles? What is the efficiency of acceleration? Is the VHE emission dominated by hadronic or leptonic interactions? By means of Monte Carlo methods, we simulate the population of SNRs in the VHE domain and confront our simulations to H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey (HGPS). We explore the parameter space: the slope of accelerated particles $\alpha$, the electron-to-proton ratio $K_{\rm ep}$, and the efficiency of particle acceleration $\xi $. We found sets of parameters for which $\gtrsim 90$\% of realisations are found in agreements with the HGPS data. These parameters are found $ 4.2 \gtrsim \alpha \gtrsim 4.1 $, $10^{-5} \lesssim K_{\rm ep} \lesssim 10^{-4.5}$, and $0.03 \lesssim \xi\lesssim 0.1 $ . We were able to strongly argue against some regions of the parameter space: $\alpha \lesssim 4.05$, $\alpha \gtrsim 4.35$, or $K_{\rm ep} \gtrsim 10^{-3}$. Our model is so far able to explain the SNR population of the HGPS. Our approach, confronted to the results of future systematic surveys, will help remove degeneracy in the solutions, and to better understand particle acceleration at SNR shocks.

 - **Abstract**
 The internal kinematics of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) disk have been modeled by several studies using different tracers with varying coverage, resulting in a range of parameters. Here, we modeled the LMC disk using 1705 star clusters and field stars, based on a robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, using the Gaia DR3 data. The dependency of model parameters on the age, coverage, and strength of the clusters are also presented. This is the first comprehensive 2D kinematic study using star clusters. Red clump (RC) stars and young main-sequence stars are also modeled for comparison. The clusters and field stars are found to have distinctly different kinematic centers, disk inclination, position angle of the line of nodes, and scale radius. We also note a significant radial variation of the disk parameters. Clusters and young stars are found to have a large residual proper motion and a relatively large velocity dispersion when compared to the RC field population, which could be due to perturbation from the bar and spiral arms. We traced the presence of large residual proper motion and non-circular motion among clusters likely to be due to the bar and detected a decrease in the scale radius as a result of the possible evolution of the bar. The kinematically deviant clusters point to a spatio-temporal disturbance in the LMC disk, matching with the expected impact factor and time of the recent collision between the LMC and the Small Magellanic Cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 Nuclear reactions drive the stellar evolution and contribute to the stellar and galactic chemicals abundances. New determinations of the nuclear reaction rates for key fusion reactions of stellar evolution are now available, paving the way to improved stellar model predictions. We explore the impact of new C12+C12 reaction rates for massive stars evolution, structure, and nucleosynthesis during core carbon-burning phase. We analyse the consequences for stars of different masses including rotation-induced mixing. We computed a grid of massive stars at solar metallicity using the stellar evolution code GENEC. We explored the results using three different references for the rates, with or without rotation. We study the effect in terms of evolution, structure, and critical mass limit between intermediate and massive stars. We explored the consequences for nucleosynthesis during the core C-burning phase by means of a one-zone nucleosynthesis code. We confirm the significant impact of using the recent nuclear reaction rates following the hindrance hypothesis as well as the mass-dependent effect of a resonance at 2.14 MeV. This impacts the characteristics of the core of stars from the C-ignition and during all the core C-burning phase. The change of rates modifies the central nucleosynthesis during the core C-burning phase, resulting in an underproduction of s-process elements. The correct and accurate determination of the nuclear reaction rates, with especially the existence and location of resonances, impacts stellar evolution in many aspects affecting the model predictions. The choice of the nuclear reaction rates reference for the C12+C12 fusion reaction changes significantly the behaviour of the core during the C-burning phase. This choice is then to be taken carefully in order to interpret stellar evolution and fate of massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Predicting the properties of the matter ejected during and after a neutron star merger is crucial to our ability to use electromagnetic observations of these mergers to constrain the masses of the neutron stars, the equation of state of dense matter, and the role of neutron star mergers in the enrichment of the Universe in heavy elements. Our ability to reliably provide such predictions is however limited by a broad range of factors, including the finite resolution of numerical simulations, their treatment of magnetic fields, neutrinos, and neutrino-matter interactions, and the approximate modeling of the equation of state of dense matter. In this manuscript, we study specifically the role that a small residual eccentricity and different implementations of the same equation of state have on the matter ejected during the merger of a $1.3M_\odot-1.4M_\odot$ binary neutron star system. We find that a residual eccentricity $e\sim 0.01$, as measured $\sim 4-6$ orbits before merger, causes $O(25\%-30\%)$ changes in the amount of ejected mass, mainly due to changes in the amount of matter ejected as a result of core bounces during merger. We note that $O(1\%)$ residual eccentricities have regularly been used in binary neutron star merger simulations as proxy for circular binaries, potentially creating an additional source of error in predictions for the mass of the dynamical ejecta.
#### Searching for planet-driven dust spirals in ALMA visibilities

 - **Abstract**
 ALMA (Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array) observations of the thermal emission from protoplanetary disc dust have revealed a wealth of substructures that could evidence embedded planets, but planet-driven spirals, one of the more compelling lines of evidence, remain relatively rare. Existing works have focused on detecting these spirals using methods that operate in image space. Here, we explore the planet detection capabilities of fitting planet-driven spirals to disc observations directly in visibility space. We test our method on synthetic ALMA observations of planet-containing model discs for a range of disc/observational parameters, finding it significantly outperforms image residuals in identifying spirals in these observations and is able to identify spirals in regions of the parameter space in which no gaps are detected. These tests suggest that a visibility-space fitting approach warrants further investigation and may be able to find planet-driven spirals in observations that have not yet been found with existing approaches. We also test our method on six discs in the Taurus molecular cloud observed with ALMA at 1.33 mm, but find no evidence for planet-driven spirals. We find that the minimum planet masses necessary to drive detectable spirals range from $\approx$ 0.03 to 0.5 $M_{\text{Jup}}$ over orbital radii of 10 to 100 au, with planet masses below these thresholds potentially hiding in such disc observations. Conversely, we suggest that planets $\gtrsim$ 0.5 to 1 $M_{\text{Jup}}$ can likely be ruled out over orbital radii of $\approx$ 20 to 60 au on the grounds that we would have detected them if they were present.
