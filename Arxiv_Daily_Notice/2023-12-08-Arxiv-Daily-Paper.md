 - **Abstract**
 The flavor evolution of neutrinos in dense astrophysical sources, such as core-collapse supernovae or compact binary mergers, is non-linear due to the coherent forward scattering of neutrinos among themselves. Recent work in this context has been addressed to figure out whether flavor equipartition could be a generic flavor outcome of fast flavor conversion. We investigate the flavor conversion physics injecting random perturbations in the neutrino field in two simulation setups: 1. a spherically symmetric simulation shell without periodic boundaries, with angular distributions evolving dynamically thanks to non-forward scatterings of neutrinos with the background medium, and neutrino advection; 2. a periodic simulation shell, with angular distributions of neutrinos defined a priori and neutrino advection. We find that, independent of the exact initial flavor configuration and type of perturbations, flavor equipartition is generally achieved in the system with periodic boundaries; in this case, perturbations aid the diffusion of flavor structures to smaller and smaller scales. However, flavor equipartition is not a general outcome in the simulation shell without periodic boundaries, where the inhomogeneities induced perturbing the neutrino field affect the flavor evolution, but do not facilitate the diffusion of flavor waves. This work highlights the importance of the choice of the simulation boundary conditions in the exploration of fast flavor conversion physics.

 - **Abstract**
 The unprecedented medium-resolution (R=1500-3500) near- and mid-infrared (1-18um) spectrum provided by JWST for the young (120-160Myr) low-mass (12-20MJup) L-T transition (L7) companion VHS1256b has opened new avenues for the in-depth characterization of substellar object atmospheres. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of this dataset utilizing a forward modelling approach. We explore five distinct atmospheric models, each aiming to encompass diverse physical and chemical phenomena proposed to happen in cool atmospheres in a self-consistent way. Our aim is to assess their performance in estimating key atmospheric parameters: Teff, log(g), [M/H], C/O, gamma, fsed, and R. To achieve this, we apply our Bayesian framework, ForMoSA, employing an optimized nested sampling algorithm for model-data comparison. Our findings reveal that each parameter's estimate is significantly influenced by factors such as the wavelength range considered, the spectral features used, the signal-to-noise ratio, and the model chosen for the fit. The observed parameter dispersion may be attributed to systematic error in the models, resulting from their difficulties in accurately replicating the complex atmospheric structure of VHS1256b, notably the complexity of its clouds and dust distribution. To propagate the impact of these systematic uncertainties on our atmospheric property estimates, we introduce innovative fitting methodologies based on independent fits performed on different spectral windows. We finally derived a Teff consistent with the spectral type of the target, considering its young age, which is confirmed by our estimate of log(g). Despite the exceptional data quality, attaining robust estimates for chemical abundances [M/H] and C/O, often employed as indicators of formation history, remains challenging with estimates dispersed on the entire range explored by the model grids.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) are considered to host the earliest stages of high-mass star formation. In particular, 70 $\mu$m dark IRDCs are the colder and more quiescent clouds. At a scale of about 5000 au using formaldehyde (H2CO) emission, we investigate the kinetic temperature of dense cores in 12 IRDCs obtained from the pilot ALMA Survey of 70 $\mu$m dark High-mass clumps in Early Stages (ASHES). Compared to 1.3 mm dust continuum and other molecular lines, such as C18O and deuterated species, we find that H2CO is mainly sensitive to low-velocity outflow components rather than to quiescent gas expected in the early phases of star formation. The kinetic temperatures of these components range from 26 to 300 K. The Mach number reaches about 15 with an average value of about 4, suggesting that the velocity distribution of gas traced by H2CO is significantly influenced by a supersonic non-thermal component. In addition, we detect warm line emission from HC3N and OCS in 14 protostellar cores, which requires high excitation temperatures (Eu/k ~ 100 K). These results show that some of the embedded cores in the ASHES fields are in an advanced evolutionary stage, previously unexpected for 70 $\mu$m dark IRDCs.
#### Physical Models for the Astrophysical Population of Black Holes:  Application to the Bump in the Mass Distribution of Gravitational Wave  Sources

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave observations of binary black holes have revealed unexpected structure in the black hole mass distribution. Previous studies of the mass distribution employ physically-motivated phenomenological models and infer the parameters that directly control the features of the mass distribution that are allowed in their model, associating the constraints on those parameters with their physical motivations. In this work, we take an alternative approach in which we introduce a model parameterizing the underlying stellar and core-collapse physics and obtaining the remnant black hole distribution as a derived byproduct. In doing so, we directly constrain the stellar physics necessary to explain the astrophysical distribution of black hole properties under a given model. We apply this approach to modeling the mapping between stellar core mass and remnant black hole mass, including the effects of mass loss due to the pulsational pair instability supernova (PPISN) process, which has been proposed as an explanation for the observed excess of black holes at $\sim 35 M_\odot$. Placing constraints on the nuclear reaction rates necessary to explain the PPISN parameters, we conclude that the peak observed at $\sim 35 M_\odot$ is highly unlikely to be a signature from the PPISN process. This procedure can be applied to modeling any physical process that underlies the astrophysical mass distribution. Allowing the parameters of the core-remnant mass relationship to evolve with redshift permits correlated and physically reasonable changes in the location, shape, and amplitude of features in the mass function. We find that the current data are consistent with no redshift evolution in the core-remnant mass relationship, but ultimately place only weak constraints on the change of these parameters.
