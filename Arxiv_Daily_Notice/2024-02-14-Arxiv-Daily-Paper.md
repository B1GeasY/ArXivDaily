 - **Abstract**
 The phenomenon of multiple stellar populations is exacerbated in massive globular clusters, with the fraction of first-population (1P) stars a decreasing function of the cluster present-day mass. We decipher this relation in far greater detail than has been done so far. We assume (i) a fixed stellar mass threshold for the formation of second-population (2P) stars, (ii) a power-law scaling $F_{1P} \propto m_{ecl}^{-1}$ between the mass $m_{ecl}$ of newly-formed clusters and their 1P-star fraction $F_{1P}$, and (iii) a constant $F_{1P}$ over time. The $F_{1P}(m_{ecl})$ relation is then evolved up to an age of 12Gyr for tidal field strengths representative of the entire Galactic halo. The 12Gyr-old model tracks cover extremely well the present-day distribution of Galactic globular clusters in (mass,$F_{1P}$) space. The distribution is curtailed on its top-right side by the scarcity of clusters at large Galactocentric distances, and on its bottom-left side by the initial scarcity of very high-mass clusters, and dynamical friction. Given their distinct dissolution rates, "inner" and "outer" model clusters are offset from each other, as observed. The locus of Magellanic Clouds clusters in (mass,$F_{1P}$) space is as expected for intermediate-age clusters evolving in a gentle tidal field. Given the assumed constancy of $F_{1P}$, we conclude that 2P-stars do not necessarily form centrally-concentrated. We infer a minimum mass of $4 \cdot 10^5~M_{\odot}$ for multiple-populations clusters at secular evolution onset. This high-mass threshold severely limits the amount of 2P-stars lost from evolving clusters, thereby fitting the low 2P-star fraction of the Galactic halo field.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cosmological Advanced Survey Telescope for Optical and ultraviolet Research (CASTOR) is a proposed Canadian-led 1m-class space telescope that will carry out ultraviolet and blue-optical wide-field imaging, spectroscopy, and photometry. CASTOR will provide an essential bridge in the post-Hubble era, preventing a protracted UV-optical gap in space astronomy and enabling an enormous range of discovery opportunities from the solar system to the nature of the Cosmos, in conjunction with the other great wide-field observatories of the next decade (e.g., Euclid, Roman, Vera Rubin). FORECASTOR (Finding Optics Requirements and Exposure times for CASTOR) will supply a coordinated suite of mission-planning tools that will serve as the one-stop shop for proposal preparation, data reduction, and analysis for the CASTOR mission. We present the first of these tools: a pixel-based, user-friendly, extensible, multi-mission exposure time calculator (ETC) built in Python, including a modern browser-based graphical user interface that updates in real time. We then provide several illustrative examples of FORECASTOR's use that advance the design of planned legacy surveys for the CASTOR mission: a search for the most massive white dwarfs in the Magellanic Clouds; a study of the frequency of flaring activity in M stars, their distribution and impacts on habitability of exoplanets; mapping the proper motions of faint stars in the Milky Way; wide and deep galaxy surveys; and time-domain studies of active galactic nuclei.
#### A revisit of the Mass-Metallicity Trends in Transiting Exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 The two prevailing planet formation scenarios, core-accretion and disk instability, predict distinct planetary mass-metallicity relations. Yet, the detection of this trend remains challenging due to inadequate data on planet atmosphere abundance and inhomogeneities in both planet and host stellar abundance measurements. Here we analyze high-resolution spectra for the host stars of 19 transiting exoplanets to derive the C, O, Na, S, and K abundances, including planetary types from cool mini-Neptunes to hot Jupiters ($T_{\rm eq}\ \sim$ 300 - 2700 K; planet radius $\sim$ 0.1 - 2 $R_{\rm J}$). Our Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the current dataset, updated based on Welbanks et al. 2019, is unable to distinguish between a linear relation and an independent distribution model for the abundance-mass correlation for water, Na, or K. To detect a trend with strong evidence (Bayes factor > 10) at the 2$\sigma$ confidence interval, we recommend a minimum sample of 58 planets with HST measurements of water abundances coupled with [O/H] of the host stars, or 45 planets at the JWST precision. Coupled with future JWST or ground-based high resolution data, this well-characterized sample of planets with precise host star abundances constitute an important ensemble of planets to further probe the abundance-mass correlation.
#### High Resolution Imaging Spectroscopy of a Tiny Sigmoidal Mini-filament  Eruption

 - **Abstract**
 Minifilament (MF) eruption producing small jets and micro-flares is regarded as an important source for coronal heating and the solar wind transients through studies mostly based on coronal observations in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray wavelengths. In this study, we focus on the chromospheric plasma diagnostics of a tiny minifilament in quiet Sun located at [71'', 450''] on 2021--08--07 at 19:11 UT observed as part of the ninth encounter of the PSP campaign. Main data obtained are the high cadence, high resolution spectroscopy from the Fast Imaging Solar Spectrograph (FISS) and high-resolution magnetograms from the Near InfraRed Imaging Spectropolarimeter (NIRIS) on the 1.6~m Goode Solar Telescope (GST) at Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). The mini-filament with size $\sim$1''$\times$5'' and a micro-flare are detected in both the H$\alpha$ line center and SDO/AIA 193, 304~\AA\ images. On the NIRIS magnetogram, we found that the cancellation of a magnetic bipole in the footpoints of the minifilament triggered its eruption in a sigmoidal shape. By inversion of the \ha\ and Ca {\sc ii} spectra under the embedded cloud model, we found a temperature increase of 3,800 K in the brightening region, associated with rising speed average of MF increased by 18~$km~s^{-1}$. This cool plasma is also found in the EUV images. We estimate the kinetic energy change of the rising filament as 1.5$\times$$10^{25}$~ergs, and thermal energy accumulation in the MF, 1.4$\times$$10^{25}$~ergs. From the photospheric magnetograms, we find the magnetic energy change is 1.6$\times$$10^{26}$~ergs across the PIL of converging opposite magnetic elements, which amounts to the energy release in the chromosphere in this smallest two-ribbon flare ever observed.
#### Polarimetry of the Ly-alpha envelope of the radio-quiet quasar SDSS  J124020.91+145535.6

 - **Abstract**
 The radio-quiet quasar SDSS J1240+1455 lies at a redshift of z=3.11, is surrounded by a Ly-alpha blob (LAB), and is absorbed by a proximate damped Ly-alpha system. In order to better define the morphology of the blob and determine its emission mechanism, we gathered deep narrow-band images isolating the Ly-alpha line of this object in linearly polarized light. We provide a deep intensity image of the blob, showing a filamentary structure extending up to 16'' (or ~122 physical kpc) in diameter. No significant polarization signal could be extracted from the data, but 95% probability upper limits were defined through simulations. They vary between ~3% in the central 0.75'' disk (after subtraction of the unpolarized quasar continuum) and ~10% in the 3.8-5.5'' annulus. The low polarization suggests that the Ly-alpha photons are emitted mostly in situ, by recombination and de-excitation in a gas largely ionized by the quasar ultraviolet light, rather than by a central source and scattered subsequently by neutral hydrogen gas. This blob shows no detectable polarization signal, contrary to LAB1, a brighter and more extended blob that is not related to the nearby active galactic nucleus (AGN) in any obvious way, and where a significant polarization signal of about 18% was detected.
