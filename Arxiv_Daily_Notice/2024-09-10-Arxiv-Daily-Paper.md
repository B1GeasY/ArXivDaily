#### McFine: python-based Monte-Carlo multi-component hyperfine structure fitting
 - **Authors:** Thomas G. Williams, Elizabeth J. Watkins
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)

 - **Abstract**
 Modelling complex line emission in the interstellar medium (ISM) is a degenerate, high-dimensional problem. Here, we present McFine, a tool for automated multi-component fitting of emission lines with complex hyperfine structure, in a fully automated way. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to efficiently explore the complex parameter space, allowing for characterising model denegeracies. This tool allows for both local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and radiative-transfer (RT) models. McFine can fit individual spectra and data cubes, and for cubes encourage spatial coherence between neighbouring pixels. It is also built to fit the minimum number of distinct components, to avoid overfitting. We have carried out tests on synthetic spectra, where in around 90~per~cent of cases it fits the correct number of components, otherwise slightly fewer components. Typically, $T_{\rm ex}$ is overestimated and $\tau$ underestimated, but accurate within the estimated uncertainties. The velocity and line widths are recovered with extremely high accuracy, however. We verify McFine by applying to a large Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) N$_2$H$^+$ mosaic of an high-mass star forming region, G316.75-00.00. We find a similar quality of fit to our synthetic tests, aside from in the active regions forming O-stars, where the assumptions of Gaussian line profiles or LTE may break down. To show the general applicability of this code, we fit CO(J = 2-1) observations of NGC 3627, a nearby star-forming galaxy, again obtaining excellent fit quality. McFine provides a fully automated way to analyse rich datasets from interferometric observations, is open source, and pip-installable.
#### H I Kinematics and the E(B-V)/N(H I) ratio

 - **Abstract**
 The $\lambda 21$cm H I emission that is used to trace the gas to dust ratio at high Galactic latitudes has contributions from material beyond the Milky Way disk, with uncertain and likely sub-Solar metallicity and dust content. These contributions can be isolated kinematically and their presence is clear for sightlines with small mean reddening $<$E(B-V)$>$ $\la$ 0.03 mag, which have mean ratios $<$N(H I)$>$/$<$E(B-V)$>$ that are 20-50\% above the high latitude Galactic average $<$N(H I)$>/<$E(B-V)$>=8.3\times10^{21}$cm$^{-2}$mag$^{-1}$. By mapping N(H I) and E(B-V) across H I High Velocity Cloud complexes and the Magellanic Clouds we show that the reddening of this kinematically-isolated gas is on average five times smaller per H I than the high latitude average. However, the aggregate contribution of this gas is small and $<$N(H I)$>/<$E(B-V)$>=8.3\times10^{21}$cm$^{-2}$mag$^{-1}$ is the appropriate value for Galactic gas seen at high latitude using the H I and reddening measures employed here and in our previous work.
#### White dwarf fundamentals
 - **Authors:** Simon Blouin
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03941

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03941

 - **Abstract**
 This chapter provides an in-depth overview of white dwarfs, the evolutionary terminus of the vast majority of stars. It discusses their discovery, their nature as degenerate objects, their connections to earlier phases of stellar evolution, their subsequent evolution as they gradually cool down, the varied physical conditions from their dense cores to their tenuous atmospheres, some key statistics about the properties of the ever expanding population of known white dwarfs, the diversity of their spectra, the accretion of planetary material, and the presence of magnetic fields. The chapter also highlights the instrumental role of white dwarfs in other areas of astronomy.
#### The Spatial Distribution of $\rm CH_4$ and $\rm CO_2$ Ice around Protostars IRAS 16253-2429 and IRAS 23385+6053

 - **Abstract**
 The origin and evolution of organic molecules represent a pivotal issue in the fields of astrobiology and astrochemistry, potentially shedding light on the origins of life. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its exceptional sensitivity and spectral resolution, is well suitable to observe molecules such as methane ($\rm CH_4$). Our analysis focused on the distribution of $\rm CH_4$, $\rm CO_2$, $\rm H_2O$, $\rm{CH_3OH+NH_4^+}$ ice and silicate absorption dips at approximately 7.7, 15.0, 6.0, 6.7 and 10.0 micrometres in two protostars: IRAS 16253-2429 and IRAS 23385+6053. We extract the $\rm CH_4$, $\rm CO_2$, $\rm H_2O$, $\rm{CH_3OH+NH_4^+}$ ice equivalent width (EW) maps and silicate extinction maps of the two sources. Our results reveal that the spatial distribution of $\rm CH_4$ in the protostellar system IRAS 16253-2429 closely mirrors that of its $\rm CO_2$ ice, forming a surrounded distribution that encircles the central protostar. This alignment suggests a common formation mechanism and subsequent trapping within the protostellar envelope, which is consistent with the "Classical" dark-cloud chemistry with ion-molecule reaction. In contrast, the spatial distributions of various molecules in the system IRAS 23385+6053 exhibit low similarities, which may be attributed to the dynamic influences of outflows or accretion processes. These discrepancies highlight the complex interplay between physical processes and chemical evolution in protostellar environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Orbiting space objects have become in the last decade a major nuisance impacting ground astronomy and orbiting space assets, from observatories to satellites and space stations. In particular with the rise of the satellite population in Low Earth Orbits (LEOs), space objects are becoming an even bigger threat and a strong problem to astronomical observations. To tackle these threats several coordinated surveillance networks composed of dedicated sensors (telescopes, radars and laser ranging facilities) track and survey space objects, from debris to active satellites. As part of the European Space Surveillance \& Tracking (EU-SST) network, Portugal is developing the PAmpilhosa da Serra Space Observatory (PASO), with both radio and optical telescopes dedicated to the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) domain, deployed at a Dark Sky destination. To optimize telescope survey time, we developed {\tt{CLOWN}} (CLOud Watcher at Night), an application interface that automatically monitors clouds in real time. This software can correctly trace clouds positions in the sky, provides accurate pointing information to the observation planning of the optical telescope to avoid cloudy areas. {\tt{CLOWN}} only requires the use of an all-sky camera, which is already a norm in observatories with optical telescopes and can be used with any camera, including those for which no information about its model specification do exist. {\tt{CLOWN}} does not require great computing power and it does not require the installation of additional equipment. {\tt{CLOWN}} results are very promising and confirm that the app can correctly identify clouds in a variety of different conditions and cloud types.
#### The External Heating of Dust in a Homogeneous Spherical Shell
 - **Authors:** Eli Dwek, Richard G. Arendt

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04391

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04391

 - **Abstract**
 We present a procedure for calculating the heating of, and the infrared emission from, dust in a homogeneous spherical shell surrounded by a spherically symmetric source of radiation. The results are applicable to newly formed dust either in supernova ejecta or in the circumstellar medium that has been swept up by the expanding shock wave. They can also be applied to the heating and IR emission from dust in clumps or clouds embedded in a homogeneous radiation field.
#### Asymptotic-state prediction for fast flavor transformation in neutron star mergers

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrino flavor instabilities appear to be omnipresent in dense astrophysical environments, thus presenting a challenge to large-scale simulations of core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers (NSMs). Subgrid models offer a path forward, but require an accurate determination of the local outcome of such conversion phenomena. Focusing on "fast" instabilities, related to the existence of a crossing between neutrino and antineutrino angular distributions, we consider a range of analytical mixing schemes, including a new, fully three-dimensional one, and also introduce a new machine learning (ML) model. We compare the accuracy of these models with the results of several thousands of local dynamical calculations of neutrino evolution from the conditions extracted from classical NSM simulations. Our ML model shows good overall performance, but struggles to generalize to conditions from a NSM simulation not used for training. The multidimensional analytic model performs and generalizes even better, while other analytic models (which assume axisymmetric neutrino distributions) do not have reliably high performances, as they notably fail as expected to account for effects resulting from strong anisotropies. The ML and analytic subgrid models extensively tested here are both promising, with different computational requirements and sources of systematic errors.
#### Buoyant crystals halt the cooling of white dwarf stars

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs are stellar remnants devoid of a nuclear energy source, gradually cooling over billions of years and eventually freezing into a solid state from the inside out. Recently, it was discovered that a population of freezing white dwarfs maintains a constant luminosity for a duration comparable to the age of the universe, signaling the presence of a powerful yet unknown energy source that inhibits the cooling. For certain core compositions, the freezing process is predicted to trigger a solid-liquid distillation mechanism, due to the solid phase being depleted in heavy impurities. The crystals thus formed are buoyant and float up, thereby displacing heavier liquid downward and releasing gravitational energy. Here we show that distillation interrupts the cooling for billions of years and explains all the observational properties of the unusual delayed population. With a steady luminosity surpassing that of some main-sequence stars, these white dwarfs defy their conventional portrayal as dead stars. Our results highlight the existence of peculiar merger remnants and have profound implications for the use of white dwarfs in dating stellar populations.
