#### Cold Gas Subgrid Model (CGSM): A Two-Fluid Framework for Modeling  Unresolved Cold Gas in Galaxy Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 The cold ($\sim 10^{4}\,{\rm K}$) component of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) accounts for a significant fraction of all galactic baryons. However, using current galaxy-scale simulations to determine the origin and evolution of cold CGM gas poses a significant challenge, since it is computationally infeasible to directly simulate a galactic halo alongside the sub-pc scales that are crucial for understanding the interactions between cold CGM gas and the surrounding ''hot'' medium. In this work, we introduce a new approach: the Cold Gas Subgrid Model (CGSM), which models unresolved cold gas as a second fluid in addition to the standard ''normal'' gas fluid. The CGSM tracks the total mass density and bulk momentum of unresolved cold gas, deriving the properties of its unresolved cloudlets from the resolved gas phase. The interactions between the subgrid cold fluid and the resolved fluid are modeled by prescriptions from high-resolution simulations of ''cloud crushing'' and thermal instability. Through a series of idealized tests, we demonstrate the CGSM's ability to overcome the resolution limitations of traditional hydrodynamics simulations, successfully capturing the correct cold gas mass, its spatial distribution, and the timescales for cloud destruction and growth. We discuss the implications of using this model in cosmological simulations to more accurately represent the microphysics that govern the galactic baryon cycle.
#### The Heterogeneous Surface of Asteroid (16) Psyche

 - **Abstract**
 Main-belt asteroid (16) Psyche is the largest M-type asteroid, a class of object classically thought to be the metal cores of differentiated planetesimals and the parent bodies of the iron meteorites. de Kleer, Cambioni, and Shepard (2021, https://doi.org/10.3847/psj/ac01ec) presented new data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), from which they derived a global best-fit thermal inertia and dielectric constant for Psyche, proxies for regolith particle size, porosity, and/or metal content, and observed thermal anomalies that could not be explained by surface albedo variations only. Motivated by this, here we fit a model to the same ALMA data set that allows dielectric constant and thermal inertia to vary across the surface. We find that Psyche has a heterogeneous surface in both dielectric constant and thermal inertia but, intriguingly, we do not observe a direct correlation between these two properties over the surface. We explain the heterogeneity in dielectric constant as being due to variations in the relative abundance of metal and silicates. Furthermore, we observe that the lowlands of a large depression in Psyche's shape have distinctly lower thermal inertia than the surrounding highlands. We propose that the latter could be explained by a thin mantle of fine regolith, fractured bedrock, and/or implanted silicate-rich materials covering an otherwise metal-rich surface. All these scenarios are indicative of a collisionally evolved world.
#### The impact of breathing pulses during core-helium burning on the core  chemical structure and pulsations of hydrogen-rich atmosphere white dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 Breathing pulses are mixing episodes that could develop during the core-helium burning phase of low- and intermediate-mass stars. The occurrence of breathing pulses is expected to bear consequences on the formation and evolution of white dwarfs, particularly on the core chemical structure, which can be probed by asteroseismology. We aim to explore the consequences of breathing pulses on the chemical profiles and pulsational properties of variable white-dwarf stars with hydrogen-rich envelopes, known as ZZ Ceti stars. We compute stellar models with masses of $1.0 M_{\odot}$ and $2.5 M_{\odot}$ in the zero-age main sequence, and evolve them through the core-helium burning phase to the thermal pulses on the asymptotic giant branch, and finally to advanced stages of white-dwarf cooling. We compare the chemical structure of the core of white dwarfs whose progenitors have experienced breathing pulses during the core-helium burning phase with the case in which breathing pulses have not occurred. We find that, when breathing pulses occur, the white-dwarf cores are larger and the central abundances of oxygen are higher than for the case in which the breathing pulses are suppressed, in line with previous studies. However, the occurrence of breathing pulses is not sufficient to explain the large cores and the excessive oxygen abundances that characterize recently derived asteroseismological models of pulsating white dwarfs. We find absolute differences of up to $\sim 30$ seconds when we compare pulsation periods of white dwarfs coming from progenitors that have experienced breathing pulses with the case in which the progenitors have not suffered breathing pulses.

 - **Abstract**
 We present NIRCam and NIRISS modules for DOLPHOT, a widely-used crowded field stellar photometry package. We describe details of the modules including pixel masking, astrometric alignment, star finding, photometry, catalog creation, and artificial star tests (ASTs). We tested these modules using NIRCam and NIRISS images of M92 (a Milky Way globular cluster), Draco II (an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy), and WLM (a star-forming dwarf galaxy). DOLPHOT's photometry is highly precise and the color-magnitude diagrams are deeper and have better definition than anticipated during original program design in 2017. The primary systematic uncertainties in DOLPHOT's photometry arise from mismatches in the model and observed point spread functions (PSFs) and aperture corrections, each contributing $\lesssim0.01$ mag to the photometric error budget. Version 1.2 of WebbPSF models, which include charge diffusion and interpixel capacitance effects, significantly reduced PSF-related uncertainties. We also observed minor ($\lesssim0.05$ mag) chip-to-chip variations in NIRCam's zero points, which will be addressed by the JWST flux calibration program. Globular cluster observations are crucial for photometric calibration. Temporal variations in the photometry are generally $\lesssim0.01$ mag, although rare large misalignment events can introduce errors up to 0.08 mag. We provide recommended DOLPHOT parameters, guidelines for photometric reduction, and advice for improved observing strategies. Our ERS DOLPHOT data products are available on MAST, complemented by comprehensive online documentation and tutorials for using DOLPHOT with JWST imaging data.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of large magnetic fields ($\gtrsim 10^6~\mathrm{G}$) in isolated white dwarfs is not clear. One possible explanation is that crystallization of the star's core drives compositional convection, which when combined with the star's rotation, can drive a dynamo. However, whether convection is efficient enough to explain the large intensity of the observed magnetic fields is still under debate. Recent work has shown that convection in cooling white dwarfs spans two regimes: efficient convection at the onset of crystallization, and thermohaline convection during most of the star's cooling history. Here, we calculate the properties of crystallization-driven convection for cooling models of several white dwarfs of different masses. We combine mixing-length theory with scalings from magneto-rotational convection to estimate the typical magnitude of the convective velocity and induced magnetic field for both scenarios. In the thermohaline regime, we find velocities $\sim 10^{-6}$--$10^{-5}~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$, with fields restricted to $\lesssim~100~\mathrm{G}$. However, when convection is efficient, the flow velocity can reach magnitudes of $\sim 10^2$--$10^3~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$, with fields of $\sim 10^6$--$10^8~\mathrm{G}$, independent of the star's rotation rate. Thus, dynamos driven at the onset of crystallization could explain the large intensity magnetic fields measured for single white dwarfs.
#### Inference of multi-channel r-process element enrichment in the Milky Way  using binary neutron star merger observations

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of GW170817 strongly suggest that binary neutron star (BNS) mergers can produce rapid neutron-capture nucleosynthesis (r-process) elements. However, it remains an open question whether BNS mergers can account for all the r-process element enrichment in the Milky Way's history. Here we demonstrate that a BNS population model informed by multimessenger neutron star observations predicts a merger rate and per-event r-process element yield consistent with geophysical and astrophysical abundance constraints. If BNS mergers are to explain the r-process enrichment of stars in the Galaxy, we further show using a one-zone Galactic chemical evolution model that they have to merge shortly after the formation of their progenitors, with a delay time distribution of power-law index $\alpha\leq -2.0$ and minimum delay time $t_{\rm min}\leq 40$ Myr at 90% confidence. Such short delay times are in tension with those inferred from short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) and those predicted by standard BNS formation models. However, we find that a two-channel enrichment scenario, where the second channel follows the star formation history, can account for both Galactic stellar and sGRB observations. Our results suggest that 40-90% of the r-process abundance in the Milky Way today was produced by a star-formation-tracking channel, rather than BNS mergers with sGRB-compatible delay times.
#### Simulating the epoch of Helium Reionization in photon-conserving  semi-numerical code SCRIPT

 - **Abstract**
 The reionization of the second electron of helium (HeII) leaves important imprints on the thermal and ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Observational evidence suggests that HeII reionization ended at $z \simeq 3$ due to ionizing photons emitted predominantly by quasars. We present efficient semi-numerical simulations of helium reionization in a $230 \ \mathrm{h^{-1}~Mpc}$ box, that takes into account the spatial patchiness of reionization coupled with photoheating of the IGM. Dark matter haloes are assigned quasars using empirical measurements of the quasar luminosity function, assuming a universal quasar lifetime consistent with duty cycle values inferred from measurements of the quasar clustering. The ionizing photon field from quasars is then included in the semi-numerical Code for ReionIzation with PhoTon conservation (SCRIPT), which was originally developed for modeling hydrogen reionization. In this work, we make appropriate modifications to SCRIPT for modeling inhomogenous HeII reionization and the corresponding thermal history of the IGM is modelled via a subgrid prescription. Our model has three main free parameters i.e. the global clumping factor $\mathcal{C}_{HeIII}$, the temperature increase due to photoheating $T^{re}_{He}$ and the quasar spectral energy distribution (SED) index, $\alpha_{UV}$. Our \textit{fiducial} model with $\mathcal{C}_{HeIII}=15.6$ and $T^{re}_{He} \sim 6000 \ K$ gives reasonable values for the empirical measurements of the temperature density equation of state at these redshifts, assuming that quasars brighter than $\mr{M_{1450}}<-21$ and having $\alpha_{UV}=1.7$ contribute to HeII reionization. The efficiency of our code shows promising prospects for performing parameter estimation in future, for models of HeII reionization using observations of the Ly$\alpha$ forest.
#### A model of scattered thermal radiation for Venus from 3 to 5 $μ$ m

 - **Abstract**
 Thermal radiation becomes a prominent feature in the continuum spectrum of Venus longwards of $\sim$3 $\mu$m. The emission is traceable to the upper cloud and haze layers in the planet's mesosphere. Venus' thermal radiation spectrum is punctuated by CO$_2$ bands of various strengths probing into different atmospheric depths. It is thus possible to invert measured spectra of thermal radiation to infer atmospheric temperature profiles and offer some insight into the cloud and haze structure. In practice, the retrieval becomes complicated by the fact that the outgoing radiation is multiply scattered by the ubiquitous aerosol particles before leaving the atmosphere. We numerically investigate the radiative transfer problem of thermal radiation from the Venus night side between 3 and 5 $\mu$m with a purpose-built model of Venus' mesosphere. Special emphasis is laid on the significance of scattering. The simulations explore the space of model parameters, which includes the atmospheric temperature, cloud opacity, and the aerosols' size and chemical composition. We confirm that aerosol scattering must be taken into account in a prospective temperature retrieval, which means an additional complication to the already ill-posed retrieval problem. We briefly touch upon the degeneracy in the spectrum's shape associated with parameterization of the Venus clouds. Reasonable perturbations in the chemical composition and size of aerosols do not significantly impact the model simulations. Although the experiments are specific to the technical characteristics of the Visual and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer on the Venus Express spacecraft, the conclusions are generally valid.
#### VLBI Analysis of a Potential High-Energy Neutrino Emitter Blazar

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies suggest that high-energy neutrinos can be produced in the jets of blazars, radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) with jets pointing close to the line of sight. Due to the relatively poor angular resolution of current neutrino detectors, several sources can be regarded as the possible counterpart of a given neutrino event. Therefore, follow-up observations of counterpart candidates in the electromagnetic regime are essential. Since the Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) technique provides the highest angular resolution to study the radio jets of blazars, a growing number of investigations are being conducted to connect individual blazars to given high-energy neutrino events. We analyzed more than 20 years of available archival VLBI data of the blazar CTD 74, which has been listed as a possible counterpart of a neutrino event. Using cm-wavelength data, we investigated the jet structure, determined the apparent speed of jet components, and the core flux density before and after the neutrino event. Our results indicate stationary jet features and a significant brightening of the core after the neutrino event.
#### Latitudinal Variation of Clouds' Structure Responsible for Venus' Cold  Collar

 - **Abstract**
 Global Climate Models (GCM) are very useful tools to study theoretically the general dynamics and specific phenomena in planetary atmospheres. In the case of Venus, several GCMs succeeded in reproducing the atmosphere's superrotation and the global temperature field. However, the highly variable polar temperature and the permanent cold collar have not been reproduced satisfactorily yet. Here we improve the radiative transfer scheme of the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace Venus GCM in order to numerically simulate the polar thermal features in Venus atmosphere. The main difference with the previous model is that we now take into account the latitudinal variation of the cloud structure. Both solar heating rates and infrared cooling rates have been modified to consider the cloud top's altitude decrease toward the poles and the variation in latitude of the different particle modes' abundances. A new structure that closely resembles the observed cold collar appears in the average temperature field at $2\times10^{4} - 4\times10^{3}$~Pa ($\sim62 - 66$~km) altitude range and $60^{\circ} - 90^{\circ}$ latitude band. It is not isolated from the pole as in the observation-based maps, but the obtained temperature values (220~K) are in good agreement with observed values. Temperature polar maps across this region show an inner warm region where the polar vortex is observed, but the obtained 230~K average value is colder than the observed mean value and the simulated horizontal structure does not show the fine-scale features present within the vortex. Our study shows that the cloud structure is essential in the cold collar formation. Although our analysis focuses on the improvement of the radiative forcing and the variations it causes in the thermal structure, polar dynamics is definitely affected by this modified environment and a noteworthy upwelling motion is found in the cold collar area.
#### Medium Resolution 0.97-5.3 micron spectra of Very Young Benchmark Brown  Dwarfs with NIRSpec onboard the James Webb Space Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 Spectra of young benchmark brown dwarfs with well-known ages are vital to characterize other brown dwarfs, for which ages are in general not known. These spectra are also crucial to test atmospheric models which have the potential to provide detailed information about the atmospheres of these objects. However, to optimally test atmospheric models, medium-resolution, long-wavelength coverage spectra with well-understood uncertainties are ideal, such as the spectra provided by the NIRSpec instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope. In this paper, we present the medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectra of two young brown dwarfs, TWA 28 (M9.0) and TWA 27A (M9.0), and one planetary-mass object, TWA 27B (L6.0), members of the TW Hydrae Association (~10 Myr). We show the richness of the atomic lines and molecular bands present in the spectra. All objects show signs of a circumstellar disk, via near-infrared excess and/or via emission lines. We matched a set of cloudless atmospheric spectra (ATMO), and cloudy atmospheric spectra (BT-Settl) to our NIRSpec spectra, and analyzed which wavelength ranges and spectral features both models reproduce best. Both models derive consistent parameters for the three sources, and predict the existence of CH4 at 3.35 microns in TWA 27B. Nonetheless, in contrast to other slightly older objects with similar spectral type, like PSO 318.5-22 and VHS 1256b, this feature is not present in the spectrum of TWA 27B. The lack of the CH4 feature might suggest that the L/T transition of very young dwarfs starts at later spectral types than for older brown dwarfs.
