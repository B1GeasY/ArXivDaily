#### Gamma-ray Emission from a Young Star Cluster in the Star-Forming Region  RCW 38

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of gamma-ray emission near the young Milky Way star cluster ($\approx$ 0.5 Myr old) in the star-forming region RCW 38. Using 15 years of data from the Fermi-LAT, we find a significant ($ \sigma > 22$) detection coincident with the cluster, producing a total $\gamma$-ray luminosity of $L_{\gamma} = (2.66\pm 0.92) \times 10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ adopting a power-law spectral model ($\Gamma = 2.34\pm0.04$) in the 0.1 $-$ 500 GeV band. We estimate the total wind power to be $7 \times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a CR acceleration efficiency of $\eta_{\rm CR} \simeq 0.4$ for a diffusion coefficient consistent with the local interstellar medium of $D = 10^{28}$ cm$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$. Alternatively, the $\gamma$-ray luminosity could also account for a lower acceleration efficiency of 0.1 if the diffusion coefficient in the star-forming region is smaller, $D\simeq 2.5\times10^{27}\,{\rm cm^2\,\,s^{-1}}$. We compare the hot-gas pressure from Chandra X-ray analysis to the CR pressure and find the former is four orders of magnitude greater, suggesting that the CR pressure is not dynamically important relative to the stellar wind feedback. As RCW 38 is too young for supernovae to have occurred, the high CR acceleration efficiency in RCW 38 demonstrates that stellar winds may be an important source of Galactic cosmic rays.

 - **Abstract**
 Faraday tomography observations with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) have unveiled a remarkable network of structures in polarized synchrotron emission at high Galactic latitudes. The observed correlation between LOFAR structures, dust polarization, and HI emission suggests a connection to the neutral interstellar medium (ISM). We investigated this relationship by estimating the rotation measure (RM) of the warm neutral (partially ionized) medium (WNM) in the local ISM. Our work combines UV spectroscopy from FUSE and dust polarization observations from \Planck\ with LOFAR data. We derived electron column densities from UV absorption spectra toward nine background stars, within the field of published data from the LOFAR two-meter sky survey. The associated RMs were estimated using a local magnetic field model fitted to the dust polarization data of \Planck. A comparison with Faraday spectra at the position of the stars suggests that LOFAR structures delineate a slab of magnetized WNM and synchrotron emission, located ahead of the bulk of the warm ionized medium. This conclusion establishes an astrophysical framework for exploring the link between Faraday structures and the dynamics of the magnetized multiphase ISM. It will be possible to test it on a larger sample of stars when maps from the full northern sky survey of LOFAR become available.
#### SN 2024ggi in NGC 3621: Rising Ionization in a Nearby, CSM-Interacting  Type II Supernova

 - **Abstract**
 We present UV/optical/NIR observations and modeling of supernova (SN) 2024ggi, a type II supernova (SN II) located in NGC 3621 at 7.2 Mpc. Early-time ("flash") spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi within +0.8 days of discovery shows emission lines of H I, He I, C III, and N III with a narrow core and broad, symmetric wings (i.e., IIn-like) arising from the photoionized, optically-thick, unshocked circumstellar material (CSM) that surrounded the progenitor star at shock breakout. By the next spectral epoch at +1.5 days, SN 2024ggi showed a rise in ionization as emission lines of He II, C IV, N IV/V and O V became visible. This phenomenon is temporally consistent with a blueward shift in the UV/optical colors, both likely the result of shock breakout in an extended, dense CSM. The IIn-like features in SN 2024ggi persist on a timescale of $t_{\rm IIn} = 3.8 \pm 1.6$ days at which time a reduction in CSM density allows the detection of Doppler broadened features from the fastest SN material. SN 2024ggi has peak UV/optical absolute magnitudes of $M_{\rm w2} = -18.7$ mag and $M_{\rm g} = -18.1$ mag that are consistent with the known population of CSM-interacting SNe II. Comparison of SN 2024ggi with a grid of radiation hydrodynamics and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (nLTE) radiative-transfer simulations suggests a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} = 10^{-2}$M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($v_w$ = 50 km/s), confined to a distance of $r < 5\times 10^{14}$ cm. Assuming a wind velocity of $v_w$ = 50 km/s, the progenitor star underwent an enhanced mass-loss episode in the last ~3 years before explosion.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most studied objects in astronomy, the Crab Nebula, is the remnant of the historical supernova SN 1054. Historical observations of the supernova imply a typical supernova luminosity, but contemporary observations of the remnant imply a low explosion energy and low ejecta kinetic energy. These observations are incompatible with a standard $^{56}$Ni-powered supernova, hinting at an an alternate power source such as circumstellar interaction or a central engine. We examine SN 1054 using a pulsar-driven supernova model, similar to those used for superluminous supernovae. The model can reproduce the luminosity and velocity of SN 1054 for an initial spin period of $\sim$ 13 ms and an initial dipole magnetic field of 10$^{14-15}$ G. We discuss the implications of these results, including the evolution of the Crab pulsar, the evolution of the remnant structure, formation of filaments, and limits on freely expanding ejecta. We discuss how our model could be tested further through potential light echo photometry and spectroscopy, as well as the modern analogues of SN 1054.

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted a follow-up study on the analysis of the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) mosaic in the high-latitude outer Galaxy presented in the first paper of this series. Here, we focus on the search for alignment between the magnetic field traced by dust, HI filaments, starlight optical linear polarisation, and linear depolarised structures (depolarisation canals) observed in low-frequency synchrotron polarisation. This alignment was previously found in several smaller fields observed with LOFAR, offering valuable insights into the nature of the interstellar medium and the 3D spatial distribution of the diffuse ionised medium. We aim to determine whether the alignment of the interstellar medium (ISM) phases observed through multiple tracers is a common occurrence or an exception. Additionally, in areas where depolarisation canals align with the magnetic field, we use starlight polarisation to constrain the distance to the structures associated with the observed canals. We employed the Rolling Hough Transform (RHT) and projected Rayleigh statistics (PRS) to identify and quantify the alignment between the different tracers. On the scale of the whole mosaic, we did not find any evidence of a universal alignment among the three tracers. However, in one particular area, the western region (Dec between $29^\circ$ and $70^\circ$ and RA between $\mathrm{7^h44^m}$ and $\mathrm{9^h20^m}$), we do find a significant alignment between the magnetic field, depolarisation canals, and HI filaments. Based on this alignment, we used the starlight polarisation of stars with known parallax distances to estimate that the minimum distance to the structures observed by LOFAR in this region lies within the range of 200 to 240 pc. We associate these structures with the edge of the Local Bubble.

 - **Abstract**
 The first (Pop III) stars formed only out of H and He and were likely more massive than present-day stars. Massive Pop III stars in the range 140-260 M$_\odot$ are predicted to end their lives as pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), enriching the environment with a unique abundance pattern, with high ratios of odd to even elements. Recently, the most promising candidate for a pure descendant of a zero-metallicity massive PISN (260 M$_{\odot}$) was discovered by the LAMOST survey, the star J1010+2358. However, the key elements to verify the high PISN contribution, C and Al, were missing from the analysis. To rectify this, we obtained and analyzed a high-resolution VLT/UVES spectrum, correcting for 3D and/or non-LTE effects. Our measurements of both C and Al give much higher values (~1 dex) than expected from a 260 M$_{\odot}$ PISN. Furthermore, we find significant discrepancies with the previous analysis, and therefore a much less pronounced odd-even effect. Thus, we show that J1010+2358 cannot be a pure descendant of a 260 M$_{\odot}$ PISN. Instead, we find that the best fit model consists of a 13 M$_{\odot}$ Pop II core-collapse supernova combined with a Pop III supernova. Alternative, less favoured solutions $(\chi^2/\chi^2_{\rm best}\approx2.3)$ include a 50% contribution from a 260 M$_{\odot}$ PISN, or a 40% contribution from a Pop III type Ia supernova. Ultimately, J1010+2358 is certainly a unique star giving insights into the earliest chemical enrichment. However, this star has not necessarily obtained any of its metals from a PISN. So the search continues for a concrete proof of the existence of zero-metallicity PISNe.

 - **Abstract**
 The trending term "filament" is extensively used in the interstellar medium (ISM) and the star formation community, and is believed to be one of the most important objects that gauge molecular cloud and star formation. However, the physical definition of these ubiquitous, elongated, high contrast features is poorly defined and still actively debated. Despite the absence of a unified consensus, filaments are believed to be involved in many important physical processes from galaxy structure formation to the emergence of protostellar objects. Therefore, understanding how filaments form, what constrains their growth, and their general physical properties, are extremely important for theorists and observers who study the dynamics of the ISM and consequent star formations. This review serves as a collection of the community's views and develops the concept of "filaments" in the context of the ISM and star-forming clouds. Observationally, filaments are seen across the entire sky and often carry an aspect ratio of the order of hundreds. In the context of the ISM, filaments are believed to form by stretching and tearing from magnetized ISM turbulence. ISM filaments are subjected to heating and cooling phases, and are likely to be magnetically aligned. Cold clouds are formed inside ISM due to turbulence instability. This review updates the understanding of ISM filaments in the community.

 - **Abstract**
 Traditional studies on stellar streams typically involve phenomenological $\Lambda$CDM halos or ad hoc dark matter (DM) profiles with different degrees of triaxiality, which preclude to gain insights into the nature and mass of the DM particles. Recently, a Maximum Entropy Principle of halo formation has been applied to provide a DM halo model which incorporates the fermionic (quantum) nature of the particles, while leading to DM profiles which depend on the fermion mass. Such profiles develop a more general dense core - diluted halo morphology able to explain the Galactic rotation curve, while the degenerate fermion core can mimic the central massive black hole (BH). We attempt to model the GD-1 stellar stream using a spherical core-halo DM distribution for the host, which, at the same time, explains the dynamics of the S-cluster stars through its degenerate fermion-core with no central BH. We used two optimization algorithms in order to fit both the initial conditions of the stream orbit and the fermionic model. The stream observables are 5D phase-space data from the Gaia DR2 survey. We were able to find good fits for both the GD-1 stream and the S-stars for a family of fermionic core-halo profiles parameterized by the fermion mass. This work provides evidence that the fermionic profile is a reliable model for both the massive central object and the DM of the Galaxy. Remarkably, this model predicts a total MW mass of $2.3\times 10^{11}M_{\odot}$ which is in agreement with recent mass estimates obtained from Gaia DR3 rotation curves (Gaia RC). In summary, with one single fermionic model for the DM distribution of the MW, we obtain a good fit in three totally different distance scales of the Galaxy: $\sim 10^{-6}$ kpc (central, S-stars), $\sim14$ kpc (mid, GD-1) and $\sim 30$ kpc (boundary, Gaia RC mass estimate).

 - **Abstract**
 A solar jet can often cause coronal mass ejections (CMEs) with different morphologies in the high corona, for example, jet-like CMEs, bubble-like CMEs, and so-called twin CMEs that include a pair of simultaneous jet-like and bubble-like CMEs. However, what determines the morphology of a jet-related CME is still an open question. Using high spatiotemporal resolution stereoscopic observations taken by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) from October 2010 to December 2012, we performed a statistical study of jet-related CMEs to study the potential physical factors that determine the morphology of CMEs in the outer corona. Our statistical sample includes 16 jet-related CME events of which 7 are twin CME events and 9 are jet-like narrow CMEs. We find that all CMEs in our sample were accompanied by filament-driven blowout jets and Type III radio bursts during their initial formation and involved magnetic reconnection between filament channels and the surrounding magnetic fields. Most of our cases occurred in a fan-spine magnetic configuration. Our study suggests that the bubble-like components of twin CMEs lacking an obvious core are related to the expansion of the closed-loop systems next to the fan-spine topology, while the jet-like component is from the coronal extension of the jet plasma along open fields. Based on the statistical results, we conclude that the morphology of jet-related CMEs in the high corona may be related to the filament length and the initial magnetic null point height of the fan-spine structures.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the second and final release of optical spectroscopy of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained during the first and second phases of the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP-I and CSP-II). The newly released data consist of 148 spectra of 30 SNe Ia observed in the course of the CSP-I, and 234 spectra of 127 SNe Ia obtained during the CSP-II. We also present 216 optical spectra of 46 historical SNe Ia, including 53 spectra of 30 SNe Ia observed by the Cal\'an/Tololo Supernova Survey. We combine these observations with previously published CSP data and publicly-available spectra to compile a large sample of measurements of spectroscopic parameters at maximum light, consisting of pseudo-equivalent widths and expansion velocities of selected features, for 232 CSP and historical SNe Ia (including more than 1000 spectra). Finally, we review some of the strongest correlations between spectroscopic and photometric properties of SNe Ia. Specifically, we define two samples: one consisting of SNe Ia discovered by targeted searches (most of them CSP-I objects) and the other composed of SNe Ia discovered by untargeted searches, which includes most of the CSP-II objects. The analysed correlations are similar for both samples. We find a larger incidence of SNe Ia belonging to the Cool (CL)and Broad Line (BL) Branch subtypes among the events discovered by targeted searches, Shallow Silicon (SS) SNe Ia are present with similar frequencies in both samples, while Core Normal (CN) SNe Ia are more frequent in untargeted searches.

 - **Abstract**
 The radio galaxy M87 is well known for its jet, which features a series of bright knots observable from radio to X-ray wavelengths. We analyze the X-ray image and flux variability of the knot HST-1 in the jet. Our analysis includes all 112 available \textit{Chandra} ACIS-S observations from 2000-2021, with a total exposure time of $\sim$887 ks. We use de-convolved images to study the brightness profile of the X-ray jet and measure the relative separation between the core and HST-1. From 2003-2005 (which coincides with a bright flare from HST-1), we find a correlation between the flux of HST-1 and its offset from the core. In subsequent data, we find a steady increase in this offset, which implies a bulk superluminal motion for HST-1 of 6.6$\pm$0.9 c (2.0$\pm$0.3 pc yr$^{-1}$), in keeping with prior results. We discuss models for the flux-offset correlation that feature either two or four emission regions separated by \textbf{tens} of parsecs. We attribute these results to moving shocks in the jet, that allow us to measure the internal structure of the jet.

 - **Abstract**
 The reactive collisions of the CH$^+$ molecular ion with electrons is studied in the framework of the multichannel quantum defect theory, taking into account the contribution of the core-excited Rydberg states. In addition to the $X^1\Sigma^+$ ground state of the ion, we also consider the contribution to the dynamics of the $a^3\Pi$ and $A^1\Pi$ excited states of CH$^+$. Our results - in the case of the dissociative recombination in good agreement with the storage ring measurements - rely on decisive improvements - complete account of the ionisation channels and accurate evaluation of the reaction matrix - of a previously used model.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic outflows have a multiphase nature making them challenging to model analytically. Many previous studies have tried to produce models that come closer to reality. In this work, we continue these efforts and describe the interaction of the hot wind fluid with multiple cold cloud populations, with their number density determined by different probability density functions. To do so, we introduced realistic cloud-wind interaction source terms and a time-varying cooling area. We find that the model reproduces well results from small-scale hydrodynamic simulations, but exhibits a general destructive behavior both for a single cloud population as well as multiple ones. We show that including multiple cloud populations can alter the evolution of the wind drastically. We also compare our model to observations and show that the differential acceleration of multiple clouds can lead to a non-negligible velocity `dispersion' relevant for down-the-barrel studies. Furthermore, we compute the emitted cooling surface brightness and find it generally too faint to explain observed Lyman-$\alpha$ halos.

 - **Abstract**
 Primitive asteroids with low albedos and red slopes in the visible and near infrared (VNIR) are found in both the Main Belt and the Jupiter Trojan clouds. In order to determine whether the VNIR spectral similarities of primitive Main Belt asteroids and Jupiter Trojans are reflective of a true compositional similarity, we compare the mid-infrared silicate emission features of Main Belt and Jupiter Trojan asteroids. Using archival data from the Spitzer Space Telescope's IRS spectrograph and observations from the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy's (SOFIA) FORCAST instrument, we analyze the 5-40 micron spectra of thirteen primitive Main Belt asteroids and compare them to those of Jupiter Trojans in the literature. We find that while many primitive asteroids in the Main Belt resemble their Trojan counterparts with strong spectral signatures of olivine-rich high-porosity silicate regoliths, we identify (368) Haidea as a spectrally distinctive asteroid that lacks strong evidence of olivine in its MIR spectrum. Differences in silicate compositions among D-type asteroids imply a diversity of origins for primitive asteroids.

 - **Abstract**
 The DARWIN/XLZD experiment is a next-generation dark matter detector with a multi-ten-ton liquid xenon time projection chamber at its core. Its principal goal will be to explore the experimentally accessible parameter space for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) in a wide mass-range, until interactions of astrophysical neutrinos will become an irreducible background. The prompt scintillation light and the charge signals induced by particle interactions in the liquid xenon target will be observed by VUV-sensitive, ultra-low background photosensors. Besides its excellent sensitivity to WIMPs with masses above $\sim$5\,GeV, such a detector with its large mass, low-energy threshold and ultra-low background level will also be sensitive to other rare interactions, and in particular also to bosonic dark matter candidates with masses at the keV-scale. We present the detector concept, discuss the main sources of backgrounds, the technological challenges and some of the ongoing detector design and R&D efforts, as well as the large-scale demonstrators. We end by discussing the sensitivity to particle dark matter interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Atomic and molecular line emissions from shocks may provide valuable information on the injection of mechanical energy in the interstellar medium (ISM), the generation of turbulence, and the processes of phase transition between the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM) and the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM).Aims. In this series of papers, we investigate the properties of shocks propagating in the WNM. Our objective is to identify the tracers of these shocks, use them to interpret ancillary observations of the local diffuse matter, and provide predictions for future observations. Methods. Shocks propagating in the WNM are studied using the Paris-Durham shock code, a multi-fluid model built to follow the thermodynamical and chemical structures of shock waves, at steady-state, in a plane-parallel geometry. The code, already designed to take into account the impact of an external radiation field, is updated to treat self-irradiated shocks at intermediate ($30<V_S <100$ km s$^{-1}$) and high velocity ($V_S \ge 100$ km s$^{-1}$) which emit ultraviolet (UV), extreme-ultraviolet (EUV), and X-ray photons. The couplings between the photons generated by the shock, the radiative precursor, and the shock structure are computed self-consistently using an exact radiative transfer algorithm for line emission. The resulting code is explored over a wide range of parameters ($0.1 \le n_H \le 2$ cm$^{-3}$, $10 \le V_S \le 500$ km s$^{-1}$, and $0.1 \le B \le 10$ $\mu$G) that covers the typical conditions of the WNM in the solar neighborhood. Results. The explored physical conditions are prompt to the existence of a diversity of stationary magnetohydrodynamic solutions, including J-type, CJ-type, and C-type shocks. These shocks are found to naturally induce phase transition between the WNM and the CNM, provided that the postshock thermal pressure is larger than the maximum pressure of the WNM and that the maximum density allowed by magnetic compression is larger than the minimum density of the CNM. The input flux of mechanical energy is primarily reprocessed into line emissions from the X-ray to the submillimeter domain. Intermediate and high velocity shocks are found to generate a UV radiation field that scales as $V_S^3$ for $V_S < 100$ km s$^{-1}$ and as $V_S^2$ at higher velocities, and an X-ray radiation field that scales as $V_S^3$ for $V_S \ge 100$ km s$^{-1}$. Both radiation fields may extend over large distances in the preshock depending of the density of the surrounding medium and the hardness of the X-ray field which is solely driven by the shock velocity. Conclusions. This first paper presents the thermochemical trajectories of shocks in the WNM and their associated spectra. It corresponds to a new milestone in the development of the Paris-Durham shock code and a stepping stone for the analysis of observations that will be carried out in forthcoming works.

 - **Abstract**
 The Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) is the closest site of very young ($\sim$ 1 Myrs) massive star formation. The ONC hosts more than 1600 young and X-ray bright stars with masses ranging from $\sim$ 0.1 to 35 $M_\odot$. The Chandra HETGS Orion Legacy Project observed the ONC with the Chandra high energy transmission grating spectrometer (HETGS) for $2.1\,$Ms. We describe the spectral extraction and cleaning processes necessary to separate overlapping spectra. We obtained 36 high resolution spectra which includes a high brilliance X-ray spectrum of $\theta^1$ Ori C with over 100 highly significant X-ray lines. The lines show Doppler broadening between 300 and $400\;\mathrm{km}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Higher spectral diffraction orders allow us to resolve line components of high Z He-like triplets in $\theta^1$ Ori C with unprecedented spectral resolution. Long term light curves spanning $\sim$20 years show all stars to be highly variable, including the massive stars. Spectral fitting with thermal coronal emission line models reveals that most sources show column densities of up to a few times $10^{22}\,$cm$^{-2}$ and high coronal temperatures of 10 to 90 MK. We observe a bifurcation of the high temperature component where some stars show a high component of 40 MK, while others show above 60 MK indicating heavy flaring activity. Some lines are resolved with Doppler broadening above our threshold of $\sim200\;\mathrm{km}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, up to $500\;\mathrm{km}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. This data set represents the largest collection of HETGS high resolution X-ray spectra from young pre-MS stars in a single star-forming region to date.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Understanding the connection between outflows, winds, accretion and disks in the inner protostellar regions is crucial for comprehending star and planet formation process. Aims. We aim to we explore the inner 300 au of the protostar IRAS 4A2 as part of the ALMA FAUST Large Program. Methods. We analysed the kinematical structures of SiO and CH$_3$OH emission with 50 au resolution. Results. The emission arises from three zones: i) a very compact and unresolved region ($<$50 au) dominated by the ice sublimation zone, at $\pm$1.5 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to vsys, traced by methanol; ii) an intermediate region (between 50 au and 150 au) traced by both SiO and CH$_3$OH, between 2 and 6 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to vsys, with an inverted velocity gradient (with respect to the large scale emission), whose origin is not clear; iii) an extended region ($>$150 au) traced by SiO, above 7 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to vsys, and dominated by the outflow. In the intermediate region we estimated a CH$_3$OH/SiO abundance ratio of about 120-400 and a SiO/H$_2$ abundance of 10$^{-8}$. We explored various possibilities to explain the origin of this region such as, rotating disk/inner envelope, jet on the plane of the sky/precessing, wide angle disk wind. Conclusions. We propose that CH$_3$OH and SiO in the inner 100 au probe the base of a wide-angle disk wind. The material accelerated in the wind crosses the plane of the sky, giving rise to the observed inverted velocity gradient, and sputtering the grain mantles and cores releasing CH$_3$OH and SiO. This is the first detection of a disk wind candidate in SiO, and the second ever in CH$_3$OH.
