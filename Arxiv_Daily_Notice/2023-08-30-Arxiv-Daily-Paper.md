#### A Parsec-Scale Catalog of Molecular Clouds in the Solar Neighborhood  Based on 3D Dust Mapping: Implications for the Mass-Size Relation

 - **Abstract**
 We dendrogram the Leike et al. 2020 3D dust map, leveraging its $\sim 1$ pc spatial resolution to produce a uniform catalog of molecular clouds in the solar neighborhood. Using accurate distances, we measure the properties of 65 clouds in true 3D space, eliminating much of the uncertainty in mass, size, and density. Clouds in the catalog contain a total of $1.1 \times 10^5 \; \rm M_{\odot}$, span distances of $116-440$ pc, and include a dozen well-studied clouds in the literature. In addition to deriving cloud properties in 3D volume density space, we create 2D dust extinction maps from the 3D data by projecting the 3D clouds onto a 2D "Sky" view. We measure the properties of the 2D clouds separately from those of the 3D clouds. Using the 2D and 3D derived results, we compare the scaling relation between the masses and sizes of clouds following Larson 1981. We find that our 2D projected mass-size relation, $M \propto r^{2.1}$, agrees with Larson's Third Relation, but our 3D derived properties lead to a scaling relation of about one order larger: $M \propto r^{2.9}$. Validating predictions from numerical simulations and analytic theory, our results indicate that the mass-size relation is sensitive to whether column or volume density is used to define clouds, since mass scales with area in 2D space ($M \propto r^{2}$) and with volume in 3D space ($M \propto r^{3}$). Our results imply a roughly constant column and volume density for molecular clouds, as would be expected for clouds where the lower density, larger volume-filling gas dominates the cloud mass budget.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the active debates in core-collapse supernova (CCSN) theory is how significantly neutrino flavor conversions induced by neutrino-neutrino self-interactions change the conventional picture of CCSN dynamics. Recent studies have indicated that strong flavor conversions can occur inside neutrino spheres where neutrinos are tightly coupled to matter. These flavor conversions are associated with either collisional instability or fast neutrino-flavor conversion (FFC) or both. The impact of these flavor conversions on CCSN dynamics is, however, still highly uncertain due to the lack of global simulations of quantum kinetic neutrino transport with appropriate microphysical inputs. Given fluid profiles from a recent CCSN model at three different time snapshots in the early post-bounce phase, we perform global quantum kinetic simulations in spherical symmetry with an essential set of microphysics. We find that strong flavor conversions occur in optically thick regions, resulting in a substantial change of neutrino radiation field. The neutrino heating in the gain region is smaller than the case with no flavor conversions, whereas the neutrino cooling in the optically thick region is commonly enhanced. Based on the neutrino data obtained from our multi-angle neutrino transport simulations, we also assess some representative classical closure relations by applying them to diagonal components of density matrix of neutrinos. We find that Eddington tensors can be well approximated by these closure relations except for the region where flavor conversions occur vividly. We also analyze the neutrino signal by carrying out detector simulations for Super-Kamiokande, DUNE, and JUNO. We propose a useful strategy to identify the sign of flavor conversions in neutrino signal, that can be easily implemented in real data analyses of CCSN neutrinos.

 - **Abstract**
 We follow our first paper with an analysis of the ensemble of the extensive pre-explosion ground- and space-based infrared observations of the red supergiant (RSG) progenitor candidate for the nearby core-collapse supernova SN 2023ixf in Messier 101, together with optical data prior to explosion obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We have confirmed the association of the progenitor candidate with the SN, as well as constrained the metallicity at the SN site, based on SN observations with instruments at Gemini-North. The internal host extinction to the SN has also been confirmed from a high-resolution Keck spectrum. We fit the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) for the star, accounting for its intrinsic variability, with dust radiative-transfer modeling, which assume a silicate-rich dust shell ahead of the underlying stellar photosphere. The star is heavily dust-obscured, likely the dustiest progenitor candidate yet encountered. We found maximum-likelihood estimates of the star's effective temperature and luminosity of 3450 K and 9.3e4 L_Sun, with 68% credible intervals of 2370--3700 K and (7.6--10.8)e4 L_sun. The candidate may have a Galactic RSG analog, IRC -10414, with a strikingly similar SED and luminosity. Via comparison with single-star evolutionary models we have constrained the initial mass of the progenitor candidate from 12 M_sun to as high as 15 M_sun. We have had available to us an extraordinary view of the SN 2023ixf progenitor candidate, which should be further followed up in future years with HST and the James Webb Space Telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova remnants (SNRs) are the best candidates for galactic cosmic ray acceleration to relativistic energies via diffusive shock acceleration. The gamma-ray emission of SNRs can provide direct evidence of leptonic (inverse Compton and bremsstrahlung) and hadronic (proton-proton interaction and subsequently pion decay) processes. Puppis A is a ~ 4 kyr old SNR interacting with interstellar clouds which has been observed in a broad energy band, from radio to gamma-ray. We performed a morphological and spectral analysis of 14 years of observations with Fermi-LAT telescope in order to study its gamma-ray emission. We found a clear asymmetry in high-energy brightness between the eastern and western sides of the remnant, reminiscent to that observed in the X-ray emission. The eastern side, interacting with a molecular cloud, shows a spectrum which can be reproduced by a pion decay model. Moreover, we analyzed two gamma-ray sources located close to the remnant. The hardness of their spectra suggests that the gamma-ray emission can be due to particles escaping from the shock of Puppis A.

 - **Abstract**
 Iron is the dominant heavy element that plays an important role in radiation transport in stellar interiors. Owing to its abundance and large number of bound levels and transitions, iron ions determine the opacity more than any other astrophysically abundant element. A few iron ions constitute the abundance and opacity of iron at the base of the convection zone (BCZ) at the boundary between the solar convection and radiative zones, and are the focus of the present study. Together, FeXVII, FeXVIII and FeXIX contribute 85\% of iron ion fractions 20\%, 39\% and 26\% respectively, at the BCZ physical conditions. We report heretofore the most extensive R-matrix atomic calculations for these ions for bound-bound and bound-free transitions, the two main processes of radiation absorption. We consider wavefunction expansions with 218 target or core ion fine structure levels of FeXVIII for FeXVII, 276 levels of FeXIX for FeXVIII, in the Breit-Pauli R-matrix (BPRM) approximation, and 180 LS terms (equivalent to 415 fine structure levels) of FeXX for FeXIX calculations. These large target expansions which includes core ion excitations to n=2,3,4 complexes enable accuracy and convergence of photoionization cross sections, as well as inclusion of high lying resonances. Photoionization cross sections have obtained for all bound fine structure levels of FeXVII and FeXVIII, and for 900 bound LS states of FeXIX. Selected results demonstrating prominent characteristic features of photoionization are presented, particularly the strong Seaton PEC (photoexcitation-of-core) resonances formed via high-lying core excitations with $\Delta n=1$ that significantly impact bound-free opacity.
#### Spherical solutions of the Schrödinger-Poisson system with core-tail  structure

 - **Abstract**
 We construct spherically symmetric equilibrium solutions of the Schr\"odinger-Poisson (SP) system of equations with a core-tail structure that could serve as models of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) halos. The core is assumed to be a solitonic ground state equilibrium configuration of the SP equations, and the tail is integrated from a transition radius onwards. The total mass of the system parametrizes the family of solutions and constrains the tail density profile. The tail has a radial velocity profile, whereas the core is stationary. We investigate the evolution of these equilibrium configurations and find that the tail initially perturbs the core, and consequently, the whole solution oscillates around a virialized solution that we call 'relaxed', whose average also has a core-tail structure. We measure the departure of the relaxed configuration from the equilibrium solution in order to estimate the utility of the latter. We also find that the core-halo scaling relation of equilibrium configurations has an exponent $\alpha=1/3$, whereas relaxed configurations exhibit a scaling with $\alpha=0.54$.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14870
 - **Abstract**
 A general formulation is employed to study and quantitatively ascertain the effect of plasma broadening of {\it intrinsic} autoionizing (AI) resonances in photoionization cross sections. In particular, R-matrix data for iron ions described in the previous paper in the RMOP series (RMOP-II, hereafter RMOP2) are used to demonstrate underlying physical mechanisms due to electron collisions, ion microfields (Stark), thermal Doppler effects, core excitations, and free-free transitions. Breit-Pauli R-matrix (BPRM) cross section for the large number of bound levels of Fe ions are considered, 454 levels of Fe~XVII, 1,184 levels of Fe~XVIII and 508 levels of Fe~XIX. Following a description of theoretical and computational methods, a sample of results is presented to show significant broadening and shifting of AI resonances due to {\it Extrinsic} plasma broadening as a function of temperature and density. Redistribution of AI resonance strengths broadly preserves their integrated strengths as well as the naturally {\it intrinsic} asymmetric shapes of resonance complexes which are broadened, smeared and flattened, eventually dissolving into the bound-free continua.
#### R-Matrix calculations for opacities: IV. Convergence, completeness, and  comparison of relativistic R-matrix and distorted wave calculations for  FeXVII and FeXVIII

 - **Abstract**
 To investigate the completeness of coupled channel (CC) Breit-Pauli R-Matrix (BPRM) calculations for opacities, we employ the relativistic distorted wave (RDW) method to complement (``top-up'') and compare the BPRM photoionization cross sections for high-$n\ell$ levels of both FeXVII and FeXVIII. Good agreement is found in background photoionization cross sections using these two methods, which also ensures correct matching of bound level cross sections for completeness. In order to top-up the CC-BPRM calculations, bound-bound transitions involving additional bound levels, and a large number of doubly-excited quasi-bound levels corresponding to BPRM autoionizing resonances described in paper RMOPII, are calculated using the RDW method. Photoionization cross sections in the high energy region are also computed and compared up to about 500 $Ry$, and contributions from higher core level excitations than BPRM are considered. The effect of configuration interaction is investigated, which plays a significant role in correctly reproducing some background cross sections. Owing to the fact that the additional RDW levels correspond to high-$n\ell$ bound levels that are negligibly populated according to the Mihalas-Hummer-D\"{a}ppen equation-of-state (Paper I), the effect on opacities is expected to be small.
#### The Effects of Non-Equilibrium Velocity Distributions on Alfvén  Ion-Cyclotron Waves in the Solar Wind

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate how the complex structure found in solar wind proton velocity distribution functions (VDFs), rather than the commonly assumed two-component bi-Maxwellian structure, affects the onset and evolution of parallel-propagating microinstabilities. We use the Arbitrary Linear Plasma Solver (ALPS), a numerical dispersion solver, to find the real frequencies and growth/damping rates of the Alfv\'en modes calculated for proton VDFs extracted from Wind spacecraft observations of the solar wind. We compare this wave behavior to that obtained by applying the same procedure to core-and-beam bi-Maxwellian fits of the Wind proton VDFs. We find several significant differences in the plasma waves obtained for the extracted data and bi-Maxwellian fits, including a strong dependence of the growth/damping rate on the shape of the VDF. By application of the quasilinear diffusion operator to these VDFs, we pinpoint resonantly interacting regions in velocity space where differences in VDF structure significantly affect the wave growth and damping rates. This demonstration of the sensitive dependence of Alfv\'en mode behavior on VDF structure may explain why the Alfv\'en ion-cyclotron instability thresholds predicted by linear theory for bi-Maxwellian models of solar wind proton background VDFs do not entirely constrain spacecraft observations of solar wind proton VDFs, such as those made by the Wind spacecraft.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the set of conditions that allow rocky planets to have liquid water on their surface -- in the form of lakes, seas or oceans -- is a major scientific step to determine the fraction of planets potentially suitable for the emergence and development of life as we know it on Earth. This effort is also necessary to define and refine the so-called "Habitable Zone" (HZ) in order to guide the search for exoplanets likely to harbor remotely detectable life forms. Until now, most numerical climate studies on this topic have focused on the conditions necessary to maintain oceans, but not to form them in the first place. Here we use the three-dimensional Generic Planetary Climate Model (PCM), historically known as the LMD Generic Global Climate Model (GCM), to simulate water-dominated planetary atmospheres around different types of Main-Sequence stars. The simulations are designed to reproduce the conditions of early ocean formation on rocky planets due to the condensation of the primordial water reservoir at the end of the magma ocean phase. We show that the incoming stellar radiation (ISR) required to form oceans by condensation is always drastically lower than that required to vaporize oceans. We introduce a Water Condensation Limit, which lies at significantly lower ISR than the inner edge of the HZ calculated with three-dimensional numerical climate simulations. This difference is due to a behavior change of water clouds, from low-altitude dayside convective clouds to high-altitude nightside stratospheric clouds. Finally, we calculated transit spectra, emission spectra and thermal phase curves of TRAPPIST-1b, c and d with H2O-rich atmospheres, and compared them to CO2 atmospheres and bare rock simulations. We show using these observables that JWST has the capability to probe steam atmospheres on low-mass planets, and could possibly test the existence of nightside water clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the low Galactic latitude ($b=4.3^\circ$) quasar 2005$+$403, the second active galactic nuclei, in which we detected a rare phenomenon of multiple imaging induced by refractive-dominated scattering. The manifestation of this propagation effect is revealed at different frequencies ($\lesssim8$ GHz) and epochs of VLBA observations. The pattern formed by anisotropic scattering is stretched out along the line of constant Galactic latitude with a local $\mathrm{PA}\approx40^\circ$ showing one-two sub-images, often on either side of the core. Analysing the multi-frequency VLBA data ranging from 1.4 to 43.2 GHz, we found that both the angular size of the apparent core component and the separation between the primary and secondary core images follow a $\lambda^2$ dependence, providing convincing evidence for a plasma scattering origin for the multiple imaging. Based on the OVRO long-term monitoring data at 15 GHz obtained for 2005$+$403, we identified the characteristic flux density excursions occurred in April-May 2019 and attributed to an extreme scattering event (ESE) associated with the passage of a plasma lens across the line of sight. Modeling the ESE, we determined that the angular size of the screen is 0.4 mas and it drifts with the proper motion of 4.4 mas yr$^{-1}$. Assuming that the scattering screen is located in the highly turbulent Cygnus region, the transverse linear size and speed of the lens with respect to the observer are 0.7 AU and 37 km s$^{-1}$, respectively.
