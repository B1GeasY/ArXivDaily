 - **Abstract**
 The dynamical formation channels of gravitational wave (GW) sources typically involve a stage when the compact object binary source interacts with the environment, which may excite its eccentricity, yielding efficient GW emission. For the wide eccentric compact object binaries, the GW emission happens mostly near the pericenter passage, creating a unique, burst-like signature in the waveform. This work examines the possibility of stellar-mass bursting sources in the millihertz band for future LISA detections. Because of their long lifetime ($\sim 10^{7}\rm\, yr$) and promising detectability, the number of millihertz bursting sources can be large in the local universe. For example, based on our estimates, there will be $\sim 3 - 45$ bursting binary black holes in the Milky Way, with $\sim 10^{2} - 10^{4}$ bursts detected during the LISA mission. Moreover, we find that the number of bursting sources strongly depends on their formation history. If certain regions undergo active formation of compact object binaries in the recent few million years, there will be a significantly higher bursting source fraction. Thus, the detection of millihertz GW bursts not only serves as a clue for distinguishing different formation channels, but also helps us understand the star formation history in different regions of the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 As the number of planetary mass objects (PMOs, $\lessapprox$13 M$_{\rm{Jupitr}}$) at wider separation ($\gtrapprox$10 AU) grows, there is emerging evidence that they form differently from their higher-mass brown-dwarf (BD) counterparts. Namely, PMOs' atmospheres are enriched by metals which is usually interpreted as a sign of solid accretion. This points to the formation channel through core accretion. However, there has hitherto been no quantitative analysis at population level to investigate the amount and timing of solid accretion. Here, we analyze a sample of five directly-imaged exoplanets with measured stellar and planetary chemical abundances (51 Eri b, $\beta$ Pic b, HIP 65426 b, and HR 8799 c and e). We show that these PMOs accrete large amount of solids regardless of formation channels. On average $\gtrapprox$100 M$_\oplus$ solids (ranging from 98.6 to 845.2 M$_\oplus$ for individual systems) are accreted to enrich planet atmospheres if forming via core accretion whereas the solid accretion needs to be $\gtrapprox$20 M$_\oplus$ (ranging from 22.4 to 782.3 M$_\oplus$) if forming via gravitational instability. The result implies that the solid accretion process has to happen at an early stage ($<$1 Myr) when large amount of solids are available in young protoplanetary disks.
#### Spectral Retrieval with JWST Photometric data: a Case Study for HIP  65426 b

 - **Abstract**
 Half of the JWST high-contrast imaging objects will only have photometric data {{as of Cycle 2}}. However, to better understand their atmospheric chemistry which informs formation origin, spectroscopic data are preferred. Using HIP 65426 b, we investigate to what extent planet properties and atmospheric chemical abundance can be retrieved with only JWST photometric data points (2.5-15.5 $\mu$m) in conjunction with ground-based archival low-resolution spectral data (1.0-2.3 $\mu$m). We find that the data is consistent with an atmosphere with solar metallicity and C/O ratios at 0.40 and 0.55. We rule out 10x solar metallicity and an atmosphere with C/O = 1.0. We also find strong evidence of silicate clouds but no sign of an enshrouding featureless {{dust}} extinction. This work offers guidance and cautionary tales on analyzing data in the absence of medium-to-high resolution spectral data.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-metallicity very massive stars with an initial mass of $\sim 140$--$260\, {\rm M_\odot}$ are expected to end their lives as pair-instability supernovae (PISNe). The abundance pattern resulting from a PISN differs drastically from regular core-collapse supernova (CCSN) models and is expected to be seen in very metal-poor (VMP) stars of ${\rm[Fe/H]}\lesssim -2$. Despite the routine discovery of many VMP stars, the unique abundance pattern expected from PISNe has not been unambiguously detected. The recently discovered VMP star LAMOST J1010+2358, however, shows a peculiar abundance pattern that is remarkably well fit by a PISN, indicating the potential first discovery of a bonafide star born from gas polluted by a PISN. In this paper, we study the detailed nucleosynthesis in a large set of models of CCSN of Pop III and Pop II star of metallicity ${\rm[Fe/H]}=-3$ with masses ranging from $12$--$30\,{\rm M_\odot}$. We find that the observed abundance pattern in LAMOST J1010+2358 can be fit at least equally well by CCSN models of $\sim 12$--$14\,{\rm M_\odot}$ that undergo negligible fallback following the explosion. The best-fit CCSN models provide a fit that is even marginally better than the best-fit PISN model. We conclude the measured abundance pattern in LAMOST J1010+2358 could have originated from a CCSN and therefore cannot be unambiguously identified with a PISN given the set of elements measured in it to date. We identify key elements that need to be measured in future detections in stars like LAMOST J1010+2358 that can differentiate between CCSN and PISN origin.
#### The period bouncer system SDSS J105754.25+275947.5: first radial  velocity study

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first radial velocity spectroscopic study of the eclipsing period bouncer SDSS J105754.25+275947.5. Together with eclipse light curve modeling, we redetermined the system parameters and studied the accretion disk structure. We confirm that the system contains a white dwarf with $M_{\mathrm{WD}}=0.83(3) M_\odot$ and an effective temperature of 11,500(400)K. The mass of the secondary is $M_2 = 0.056 M_\odot$ with an effective temperature of T$_2$=2,100K or below. The system inclination is $i=84.3(6)$. The data is in good agreement with our determination of $K_1$ = 33(4) km s$^{-1}$. We estimate the mass transfer rate as $\dot{M}=$1.9(2)$\times 10^{-11} M_\odot yr^{-1}$. Based on an analysis of the SDSS and OSIRIS spectra, we conclude that the optical continuum is formed predominantly by the radiation from the white dwarf. The contribution of the accretion disk is low and originates from the outer part of the disk. The Balmer emission lines are formed in a plasma with $\log$ $N_0$ = 12.7 [cm$^{-1}$] and a kinetic temperature of T$\sim$10,000K. The size of the disk, where the emission lines are formed, expands up to $R_\mathrm{d,out}=0.29 R_\odot$. The inner part of the emission line forming region goes down to $R_\mathrm{d,in}\approx 2 R_\mathrm{WD}$ . The Doppler tomography and trailed spectra show the presence of a hot spot and a clumpy structure in the disk, with variable intensity along the disk position angle. There is an extended region at the side opposite the hot spot with two bright clumps caused more probably by non-Keplerian motion there.

 - **Abstract**
 Dusty starless cores play an important role in regulating the initial phases of the formation of stars and planets. In their interiors, dust grains coagulate and ice mantles form, thereby changing the millimeter emissivities and hence the ability to cool. We mapped four regions with more than a dozen cores in the nearby Galactic filaments of Taurus and Perseus using the NIKA-2 camera at the IRAM 30-meter telescope. Combining the 1mm to 2mm flux ratio maps with dust temperature maps from Herschel allowed to create maps of the dust emissivity index beta1,2 at resolutions of 2430 and 5600a.u. in Taurus and Perseus, respectively. Here, we study the variation with total column densities and environment. Beta1,2 values at the core centers (Av=12-19mag) vary significantly between ~1.1 and 2.3. Several cores show a strong rise of beta1,2 from the outskirts at ~4mag to the peaks of optical extinctions, consistent with the predictions of grain models and the gradual build-up of ice mantles on coagulated grains in the dense interiors of starless cores.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a Bayesian inference method to characterise the dust emission properties using the well-known dust-\hi\ correlation in the diffuse interstellar medium at Planck frequencies $\nu \ge 217$\,GHz. We use the Galactic \hi\ map from the Galactic All-Sky Survey (GASS) as a template to trace the Galactic dust emission. We jointly infer the pixel-dependent dust emissivity and the zero level present in the Planck intensity maps. We use the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo technique to sample the multi-dimensional parameter space. We demonstrate that the methodology is unbiased when applied to realistic Planck sky simulations over a 7500 deg$^2$ area around the Southern Galactic pole. As an application on data, we analyse the Planck intensity map at 353 GHz to jointly infer the pixel-dependent dust emissivity at $\Nside=32$ resolution (1.8\deg\ pixel size) and the global offset. We find that the spatially varying dust emissivity has a mean of 0.031 $\MJysr (10^{20} \mathrm{cm^{-2}})^{-1}$ and $1\sigma$ standard deviation of 0.007 $\MJysr (10^{20} \mathrm{cm^{-2}})^{-1}$. The mean dust emissivity increases monotonically with increasing mean \hi\ column density. We find that the inferred global offset is consistent with the expected level of Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) monopole added to the Planck data at 353 GHz. This method is useful in studying the line-of-sight variations of dust spectral energy distribution in the multi-phase interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 A key outstanding question in star and planet formation is how far the initial mass function of stars and sub-stellar objects extends, and whether or not there is a cut-off at the very lowest masses. Isolated objects in the planetary-mass domain below 13 Jupiter masses, where not even deuterium can fuse, are very challenging to observe as these objects are inherently faint. Nearby star-forming regions provide the best opportunity to search for them though: while they are young, they are still relatively warm and luminous at infrared wavelengths. Previous surveys have discovered a handful of such sources down to 3--5 Jupiter masses, around the minimum mass limit established for formation via the fragmentation of molecular clouds, but does the mass function extend further? In a new James Webb Space Telescope near-infrared survey of the inner Orion Nebula and Trapezium Cluster, we have discovered and characterised a sample of 540 planetary-mass candidates with masses down to 0.6 Jupiter masses, demonstrating that there is indeed no sharp cut-off in the mass function. Furthermore, we find that 9\% of the planetary-mass objects are in wide binaries, a result that is highly unexpected and which challenges current theories of both star and planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We use high-resolution numerical simulations to follow the barred disk evolution in a suite of models with progressively more massive stellar bulges, with bulge-to-total (disk$+$bulge) mass ratios of $B/T\sim 0-0.25$, embedded in dark matter (DM) halos with the spin $\lambda \sim 0 - 0.09$. We focus on models with a sequence of initial rotational support for bulges, and analyze their spinup and spindown. We find that (1) the presence of a bulge affects the evolution of stellar bars, i.e., the timescale of bar instability, bar pattern speed and its decay, and the vertical buckling instability. The bar strength is nearly independent of $B/T$ in halos with spin $\lambda = 0$, and is suppressed by a factor $\sim 2$ for halos with $\lambda = 0.09$; (2) The main effect of the bulge is the destruction of the harmonic core which affects the buckling; (3) The bulge plays a minor role in the exchange of angular momentum between the barred disk and the DM halo, during its spinup and spindown; (4) Most interestingly, the buckling process triggers different response above/below the disk midplane, which anti-correlates with the bulge mass; (5) In spinning halos, the buckling process has a prolonged amplitude tail, extending by few Gyr, as verified by measuring distortions in the Laplace plane; (6) Furthermore, as verified by orbital spectral analysis, the bulge gains its spin from the bar mainly via the inner Lindblad resonance, while losing it via a number of resonances lying between the outer and inner Lindblad resonance.
