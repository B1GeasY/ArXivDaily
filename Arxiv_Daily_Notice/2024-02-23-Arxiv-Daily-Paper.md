 - **Abstract**
 We present the first Chandra X-ray observations of H72.97-69.39, a highly-embedded, potential super-star cluster (SSC) in its infancy located in the star-forming complex N79 of the Large Magellanic Cloud. We detect particularly hard, diffuse X-ray emission that is coincident with the young stellar object (YSO) clusters identified with JWST, and the hot gas fills cavities in the dense gas mapped by ALMA. The X-ray spectra are best fit with either a thermal plasma or power-law model, and assuming the former, we show that the X-ray luminosity of L_X = (1.5 +- 0.3)e34 erg/s is a factor of ~20 below the expectation for a fully-confined wind bubble. Our results suggest that stellar wind feedback produces diffuse hot gas in the earliest stages of massive star cluster formation and that wind energy can be lost quickly via either turbulent mixing followed by radiative cooling or by physical leakage.

 - **Abstract**
 Studies on the dynamics of solar filaments have significant implications for understanding their formation, evolution, and eruption, which are of great importance for space weather warning and forecasting. The H$\alpha$ Imaging Spectrograph (HIS) onboard the recently launched Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar Explorer (CHASE) can provide full-disk solar H$\alpha$ spectroscopic observations, which bring us an opportunity to systematically explore and analyze the plasma dynamics of filaments. The dramatically increased observation data require automate processing and analysis which are impossible if dealt with manually. In this paper, we utilize the U-Net model to identify filaments and implement the Channel and Spatial Reliability Tracking (CSRT) algorithm for automated filament tracking. In addition, we use the cloud model to invert the line-of-sight velocity of filaments and employ the graph theory algorithm to extract the filament spine, which can advance our understanding of the dynamics of filaments. The favorable test performance confirms the validity of our method, which will be implemented in the following statistical analyses of filament features and dynamics of CHASE/HIS observations.
#### Color-flavor locked strange stars with a mirror-dark-matter core and the  observations of compact stars

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the structure and the tidal deformability of the color-flavor locked strange stars with a mirror-dark-matter core. Assuming the stars in the GW170817 event have a mirror-dark-matter core, the observations of the central compact object within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347 and the compact objects in the GW190814 and GW170817 events could be explained simultaneously with a pairing gap much smaller than 200 MeV, while a pairing gap larger than about 200 MeV must be employed without the consideration of a mirror-dark-matter core. More importantly, we find that for the case of the quartic coefficient $a_{4}< 0.589$, if the mirror-dark-matter core in the compact stars of GW170817 is large enough (e.g., the mass fraction of the mirror-dark-matter core is larger than 22.8% for $a_{4}= 0.55$), the minimum allowed value of the pairing gap could be less than 46.5 MeV (i.e., one half of the value of the strange quark mass which is taken as 93 MeV in this paper), which leads to the result that all astrophysical observations mentioned above could be satisfied without violating the conformal bound or the recently proposed positive trace anomally bound.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae can be a copious source of sterile neutrinos, hypothetical particles that mix with active neutrinos. We develop two-dimensional stellar core-collapse models that incorporate the mixing between tau neutrinos and heavy sterile neutrinos -- those with the mass of 150--200 MeV -- to investigate signatures of sterile neutrinos in supernova observables. We find that the decay channel of a sterile neutrino into a pion and a tau neutrino can enhance the explosion energy and the synthesized nickel mass. Although the inclusion of sterile neutrinos considered in this study slightly reduce the neutrino and gravitational-wave signals, we find that they are still detectable for a Galactic event. Furthermore, we point out that if sterile neutrinos are as massive as ~200 MeV, they produce high-energy tau antineutrinos with energies of ~80 MeV, the detection of which can be a smoking signature of the sterile neutrinos and where Hyper-Kamiokande should play a pivotal role.

 - **Abstract**
 We are performing a line survey of 8 planet-forming Class II disks in Taurus with the IRAM NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA), as a part of the MPG-IRAM Observatory Program PRODIGE (PROtostars and DIsks: Global Evolution; PIs: P. Caselli and Th. Henning). Compact and extended disks around T Tauri stars CI, CY, DG, DL, DM, DN, IQ Tau, and UZ Tau E are observed in ~80 lines from >20 C-, O,- N-, and S-bearing species. The observations in four spectral settings at 210-280 GHz with $1\sigma$ rms sensitivity of ~8-12 mJy/beam at 0.9" and 0.3 km/s resolution will be completed in 2024. The uv-visibilities are fitted with the DiskFit model to obtain key stellar and disk properties. In this paper, the combined $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O $J = 2-1$ data are presented. We find that the CO fluxes and disk masses inferred from dust continuum tentatively correlate with the CO emission sizes. We constrain dynamical stellar masses, geometries, temperatures, the CO column densities and gas masses for each disk. The best-fit temperatures at 100 au are ~17-37 K, and decrease radially with the power-law exponent q ~ 0.05-0.76. The inferred CO column densities decrease radially with the power-law exponent p ~ 0.2-3.1. The gas masses estimated from $^{13}$CO (2-1) are ~ $0.001-0.2 M_\textrm{Sun}$. The best-fit CO column densities point to severe CO freeze-out in the disks. The DL Tau disk is an outlier, and has either stronger CO depletion or lower gas mass than the rest of the sample. The CO isotopologue ratios are roughly consistent with the observed values in disks and the low-mass star-forming regions.
#### Internal magnetic field structures observed by PSP/WISPR in a filament  related coronal mass ejection

 - **Abstract**
 We track and investigate from white-light data taken with the Wide-field Instrument for Solar PRobe (WISPR) aboard Parker Solar Probe (PSP), localized density enhancements, reflecting small-scale magnetic structures belonging to a filament-related coronal mass ejection (CME). We aim to investigate the 3D location, morphology, and evolution of the internal magnetic fine structures of CMEs. Specifically, we ask: what is their relationship with the filament/source region and the flux rope? The fast tangential motion of the PSP spacecraft during its perihelion permits viewing the same event from multiple angles in short times relative to the event's evolution. Hence, we can derive the three-dimensional information of selected CME features from a single spacecraft using triangulation techniques. We group small-scale structures with roughly similar speeds, longitude and latitude, into three distinct morphological groups. We find twisted magnetic field patterns close to the eastern leg of the CME that may be related to 'horns' outlining the edges of the flux-rope cavity. Aligned thread-like bundles are identified close to the western leg. They may be related to confined density enhancements evolving during the filament eruption. High density blob-like features (magnetic islands) are widely spread in longitude ($\sim$40{\deg}) close to the flanks and rear part of the CME. We demonstrate that CME flux ropes may comprise different morphological groups with a cluster behavior, apart from the blobs which instead span a wide range of longitudes. This may hint either to the three-dimensionality of the post-CME current sheet (CS) or to the influence of the ambient corona in the evolutionary behavior of the CS. Importantly, we show that the global appearance of the CME can be very different in WISPR (0.11--0.16~AU) and instruments near 1~AU because of shorter line-of-sight integration of WISPR.
