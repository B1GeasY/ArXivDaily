#### Likelihood-Based Jump Detection and Cosmic Ray Rejection for Detectors  Read Out Up-the-Ramp
 - **Authors:** Timothy D. Brandt

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01326
 - **Abstract**
 This paper implements likelihood-based jump detection for detectors read out up-the-ramp, using the entire set of reads to compute likelihoods. The approach compares the $\chi^2$ value of a fit with and without a jump for every possible jump location. I show that this approach can be substantially more sensitive than one that only uses the difference between sequential groups of reads, especially for long ramps and for jumps that occur in the middle of a group of reads. It can also be implemented for a computational cost that is linear in the number of resultants. I provide and describe a pure Python implementation that can process a 10-resultant ramp on a $4096 \times 4096$ detector in $\approx$20 seconds, including iterative cosmic ray detection and removal, on a single core of a 2020 Macbook Air. This Python implementation, together with tests and a tutorial notebook, are available at \url{https://github.com/t-brandt/fitramp}. I also provide tests and demonstrations of the full ramp fitting and cosmic ray rejection approach on data from JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 We use a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy to study and quantify the topology of magnetic field lines around cold gas clouds in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). This simulation is a new addition to Project GIBLE, a suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation with preferential super-Lagrangian refinement in the CGM, reaching an unprecedented (CGM) gas mass resolution of $\sim$ $225$ M$_\odot$. To maximize statistics and resolution, we focus on a sample of $\sim$ $200$ clouds with masses of $\sim$ $10^6$ M$_\odot$. The topology of magnetic field lines around clouds is diverse, from threading to draping, and there is large variation in the magnetic curvature ($\kappa$) within cloud-background interfaces. We typically find little variation of $\kappa$ between upstream and downstream cloud faces, implying that strongly draped configurations are rare. In addition, $\kappa$ correlates strongly with multiple properties of the interface and the ambient background, including cloud overdensity and relative velocity, suggesting that cloud properties impact the topology of interface magnetic fields.

 - **Abstract**
 Draco dwarf Spheroidal galaxy (dSph) is one of the nearest and the most dark matter dominated satellites of the Milky Way. We obtained multi-epoch near-infrared (NIR, $JHK_s$) observations of the central region of Draco dSph covering a sky area of $\sim 21'\times21'$ using the WIRCam instrument at the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Homogeneous $JHK_s$ time-series photometry for 212 RR Lyrae (173 fundamental-mode, 24 first-overtone, and 15 mixed-mode variables) and 5 Anomalous Cepheids in Draco dSph is presented and used to derive their period-luminosity relations at NIR wavelengths for the first-time. The small scatter of $\sim 0.05$~mag in these empirical relations for RR Lyrae stars is consistent with those in globular clusters and suggests a very small metallicity spread, up to $\sim0.2$~dex, among these centrally located variables. Based on empirically calibrated NIR period-luminosity-metallicity relations for RR Lyrae in globular clusters, we determined a distance modulus to Draco dSph of $\mu_\textrm{RRL} = 19.557 \pm 0.026$ mag. The calibrated $K_s$-band period-luminosity relations for Anomalous Cepheids in the Draco dSph and the Large Magellanic Cloud exhibit statistically consistent slopes but systematically different zero-points, hinting at possible metallicity dependence of $\sim-0.3$ mag~dex$^{-1}$. Finally, the apparent magnitudes of the tip of the red giant branch in $I$ and $J$ bands also agree well with their absolute calibrations with the adopted RR Lyrae distance to Draco. Our recommended $\sim1.5\%$ precise RR Lyrae distance, $D_\textrm{Draco} = 81.55 \pm 0.98 \textrm{(statistical)} \pm 1.17 \textrm{(systematic)}$~kpc, is the most accurate and precise distance to Draco dSph galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Future astrophysics missions will seek extraterrestrial life via transmission and direct imaging observations. To assess habitability and biosignatures, we need robust retrieval tools to analyze observed spectra, and infer surface and atmospheric properties with their uncertainties. We use a novel retrieval tool to assess accuracy in characterizing near-surface habitability and biosignatures via simulated transmission and direct imaging spectra, based on the Origins Space Telescope (Origins) and LUVOIR mission concepts. We assess our ability to discriminate between an Earth-like and a false-positive O$_3$ TRAPPIST-1 e with transmission spectroscopy. In reflected light, we assess the robustness of retrieval results to un-modeled cloud extinction. We find that assessing habitability using transmission spectra may be challenging due to relative insensitivity to surface temperature and near-surface H$_2$O abundances. Nonetheless, our order of magnitude H$_2$O constraints can discriminate extremely desiccated worlds. Direct imaging is insensitive to surface temperature and subject to the radius/albedo degeneracy, but this method proves highly sensitive to surface water abundance, achieving retrieval precision within 0.1% even with partial clouds. Concerning biosignatures, Origins-like transmission observations ($t=40$ hours) may detect the CO$_2$/CH$_4$ pair on M-dwarf planets and differentiate between biological and false positive O$_3$ using H$_2$O and abundant CO. In contrast, direct imaging observations with LUVOIR-A ($t=10$ hours) are better suited to constraining O$_2$ and O$_3$, and may be sensitive to wavelength-dependent water cloud features, but will struggle to detect modern Earth-like abundances of methane. For direct imaging, we weakly detect a stratospheric ozone bulge by fitting the near-UV wings of the Hartley band.
#### Haro 11: The Spatially Resolved Lyman Continuum Sources

 - **Abstract**
 As the nearest confirmed Lyman continuum (LyC) emitter, Haro 11 is an exceptional laboratory for studying LyC escape processes crucial to cosmic reionization. Our new HST/COS G130M/1055 observations of its three star-forming knots now reveal that the observed LyC originates in Knots B and C, with $903 - 912~\r{A}$ luminosities of $1.9\pm1.5 \times 10^{40}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$ and $0.9\pm0.7 \times 10^{40}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, respectively. We derive local escape fractions $f_{\rm{esc, 912}} = 3.4\pm2.9\%$ and $5.1\pm4.3\%$ for Knots B and C, respectively. Our Starburst99 modeling shows dominant populations on the order of $\sim1-4$ Myr and $1-2\times10^7 \rm~M_\odot$ in each knot, with the youngest population in Knot B. Thus, the knot with the strongest LyC detection has the highest LyC production. However, LyC escape is likely less efficient in Knot B than in Knot C due to higher neutral gas covering. Our results therefore stress the importance of the intrinsic ionizing luminosity, and not just the escape fraction, for LyC detection. Similarly, the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction does not consistently correlate with LyC flux, nor do narrow Ly$\alpha$ red peaks. High observed Ly$\alpha$ luminosity and low Ly$\alpha$ peak velocity separation, however, do correlate with higher LyC escape. Another insight comes from the undetected Knot A, which drives the Green Pea properties of Haro 11. Its density-bounded conditions suggest highly anisotropic LyC escape. Finally, both of the LyC-leaking Knots, B and C, host ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). While stars strongly dominate over the ULXs in LyC emission, this intriguing coincidence underscores the importance of unveiling the role of accretors in LyC escape and reionization.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we provide a new, well-controlled expansion of the equation of state of dense matter from zero to finite temperatures ($T$), while covering a wide range of charge fractions ($Y_Q$), from pure neutron to isospin symmetric nuclear matter. Our expansion can be used to describe neutron star mergers and core-collapse supernova explosions using as a starting point neutron star observations, while maintaining agreement with laboratory data, in a model independent way. We suggest new thermodynamic quantities of interest that can be calculated from theoretical models or directly inferred by experimental data that can help constrain the finite $T$ equation of state. With our new method, we can quantify the uncertainty in our finite $T$ and $Y_Q$ expansions in a well-controlled manner without making assumptions about the underlying degrees of freedom. We can reproduce results from a microscopic equation of state up to $T=100$ MeV for baryon chemical potential $\mu_B\gtrsim 1100$ MeV ($\sim1-2 \ n_{\rm sat}$) within $5\%$ error, with even better results for larger $\mu_B$ and/or lower $T$. We investigate the sources of numerical and theoretical uncertainty and discuss future directions of study.

 - **Abstract**
 Attitude is one of the crucial parameters for space objects and plays a vital role in collision prediction and debris removal. Analyzing light curves to determine attitude is the most commonly used method. In photometric observations, outliers may exist in the obtained light curves due to various reasons. Therefore, preprocessing is required to remove these outliers to obtain high quality light curves. Through statistical analysis, the reasons leading to outliers can be categorized into two main types: first, the brightness of the object significantly increases due to the passage of a star nearby, referred to as "stellar contamination," and second, the brightness markedly decreases due to cloudy cover, referred to as "cloudy contamination." Traditional approach of manually inspecting images for contamination is time-consuming and labor-intensive. However, We propose the utilization of machine learning methods as a substitute. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are employed to identify cases of stellar contamination and cloudy contamination, achieving F1 scores of 1.00 and 0.98 on test set, respectively. We also explored other machine learning methods such as Residual Network-18 (ResNet-18) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (lightGBM), then conducted comparative analyses of the results.
#### Diagnostics of 3D explosion asymmetries of stripped-envelope supernovae  by nebular line profiles

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the explosion mechanism and hydrodynamic evolution of core-collapse supernovae is a long-standing quest in astronomy. The asymmetries caused by the explosion are encoded into the line profiles which appear in the nebular phase of the SN evolution -- with particularly clean imprints in He star explosions. Here, we carry out nine different supernova simulations of He-core progenitors, exploding them in 3D with parametrically varied neutrino luminosities using the $\texttt{Prometheus-HotB}$ code, hydrodynamically evolving the models to the homologeous phase. We then compute nebular phase spectra with the 3D NLTE spectral synthesis code $\texttt{ExTraSS}$ (EXplosive TRAnsient Spectral Simulator). We study how line widths and shifts depend on progenitor mass, explosion energy, and viewing angle. We compare the predicted line profile properties against a large set of Type Ib observations, and discuss the degree to which current neutrino-driven explosions can match observationally inferred asymmetries. With self-consistent 3D modelling -- circumventing the difficulties of representing $^{56}$Ni mixing and clumping accurately in 1D models -- we find that neither low-mass He cores exploding with high energies nor high-mass cores exploding with low energies contribute to the Type Ib SN population. Models which have line profile widths in agreement with this population give sufficiently large centroid shifts for calcium emission lines. Calcium is more strongly affected by explosion asymmetries connected to the neutron star kicks than oxygen and magnesium. Lastly, we turn to the NIR spectra from our models to investigate the potential of using this regime to look for the presence of He in the nebular phase.
#### Estimation of the atmospheric absorption profile with isotropic  background events observed by Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes rely on the Earth's atmosphere as part of the detector. The presence of clouds affects observations and can introduce biases if not corrected for. Correction methods typically require an atmospheric profile, that can be measured with external atmospheric monitoring devices. We present a novel method for measuring the atmospheric profile using the data from Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes directly. The method exploits the comparison of average longitudinal distributions of the registered Cherenkov light between clear atmosphere and cloud presence cases. Using Monte Carlo simulations of a subarray of four Large-Sized Telescopes of the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory and a simple cloud model we evaluate the accuracy of the method in determining the basic cloud parameters. We find that the method can reconstruct the transmission of typical clouds with an absolute accuracy of a few per cent. For low-zenith observations, the height of the cloud centre can be reconstructed with a typical accuracy of a few hundred metres, while the geometrical thickness can be accurately reconstructed only if it is >= 3 km. We also evaluate the robustness of the method against the typical systematic uncertainties affecting atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes.
#### On the surface helium abundance of B-type hot subdwarf stars from the  WD+MS channel of Type Ia supernovae

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01905
 - **Abstract**
 The origin of intermediate helium (He)-rich hot subdwarfs are still unclear. Previous studies have suggested that some surviving Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) companions from the white dwarf~+~main-sequence (WD+MS) channel may contribute to the intermediate He-rich hot subdwarfs. However, previous studies ignored the impact of atomic diffusion on the post-explosion evolution of surviving companion stars of SNe Ia, leading to that they could not explain the observed surface He abundance of intermediate He-rich hot subdwarfs. In this work, by taking the atomic diffusion and stellar wind into account, we trace the surviving companions of SNe Ia from the WD+MS channel using the one-dimensional stellar evolution code \textsc{MESA} until they evolve into hot subdwarfs. We find that the surface He-abundances of our surviving companion models during their core He-burning phases are in a range of $-1 \lesssim {\rm log}(N_{\rm He}/N_{\rm H}) \lesssim 0$, which are consistent with those observed in intermediate He-rich hot subdwarfs. This seems to further support that surviving companions of SNe Ia in the WD+MS channel are possible to form some intermediate He-rich hot subdwarfs.
#### Ram pressure stripping in clusters: Gravity can bind the ISM but not the  CGM

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the survival of a galaxy's circumgalactic medium (CGM) as it experiences ram pressure stripping (RPS) moving through the intracluster medium (ICM). For a satellite galaxy, the CGM is often assumed to be entirely stripped/evaporated, an assumption that may not always be justified. We carry out 3D-hydrodynamics simulations of RPS of the interstellar medium (ISM) and the CGM of a galaxy with mass and size comparable to the jellyfish galaxy JO201. We find that the CGM can survive long at cluster outskirts ($\gtrsim 2$ Gyr). However, at smaller cluster-centric distances, 90\% of the CGM mass is lost within $\sim 500$ Myr. Our simulations suggest that the gravitational restoring force on the CGM is mostly negligible and the CGM-ICM interaction is analogous to 'cloud-wind interaction'. The CGM stripping timescale depends not on the ram pressure but on $\chi$, the ratio of CGM to ICM density. Two distinct regimes emerge for CGM stripping: the $\chi >1$ regime, which is the well-known 'cloud-crushing' problem, and the $\chi < 1$ regime, which we refer to as the (relatively unexplored) 'bubble-drag' problem. The cloud-crushing regime ($\chi >1$) suggests a CGM stripping timescale proportional to the drag time $t_{\rm drag} \sim \chi R/v_{\rm rel}$ ($R$ is the CGM size, $v_{\rm rel}$ is the relative velocity). The bubble-drag regime ($\chi < 1$) is qualitatively different and gives a shorter stripping timescale comparable to the crossing time -- $t_{\rm drag} \sim R/v_{\rm rel}$, independent of $\chi$. The ISM stripping criterion unlike the CGM, still depends on the ram pressure $\rho_{\rm ICM} v_{\rm rel}^2$ (the classic Gunn and Gott 1972 condition). The stripped tails of satellites contain contributions from both the disk and its trailing CGM. Overall, we identify novel physical mechanisms and previously unexplored stripping regimes.
#### The Thousand-Pulsar-Array programme on MeerKAT XIII: Timing, flux  density, rotation measure and dispersion measure timeseries of 597 pulsars

 - **Abstract**
 We report here on the timing of 597 pulsars over the last four years with the MeerKAT telescope. We provide Times-of-Arrival, pulsar ephemeris files and per-epoch measurements of the flux density, dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM) for each pulsar. In addition we use a Gaussian process to model the timing residuals to measure the spin frequency derivative at each epoch. We also report the detection of 11 glitches in 9 individual pulsars. We find significant DM and RM variations in 87 and 76 pulsars respectively. We find that the DM variations scale approximately linearly with DM, which is broadly in agreement with models of the ionised interstellar medium. The observed RM variations seem largely independent of DM, which may suggest that the RM variations are dominated by variations in the interstellar magnetic field on the line of sight, rather than varying electron density. We also find that normal pulsars have around 5 times greater amplitude of DM variability compared to millisecond pulsars, and surmise that this is due to the known difference in their velocity distributions.
#### Gas kinematics and dynamics of Carina Pillars: A case study of  G287.76-0.87

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02119
 - **Abstract**
 We study the kinematics of a pillar, namely G287.76-0.87, using three rotational lines of $^{12}$CO(5-4), $^{12}$CO(8-7), $^{12}$CO(11-10), and a fine structure line of [OI] $63\,\mu$m Southern Carina observed by SOFIA/GREAT. This pillar is irradiated by the associated massive star cluster Trumpler 16, which includes $\eta$~Carina. Our analysis shows that the relative velocity of the pillar with respect to this ionization source is small, $\sim 1\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$, and the gas motion in the tail is more turbulent than in the head. We also performed analytical calculations to estimate the gas column density in local thermal equilibrium (LTE) conditions, which yields $N_{\rm CO}$ as $(\sim 0.2 -5)\times 10^{17}\,\rm cm^{-2}$. We further constrain the gas's physical properties in non-LTE conditions using RADEX. The non-LTE estimations result in $n_{\rm H_{2}} \simeq 10^{5}\,\rm cm^{-3}$ and $N_{\rm CO} \simeq 10^{16}\,\rm cm^{-2}$. We found that the thermal pressure within the G287.76-0.87 pillar is sufficiently high to make it stable for the surrounding hot gas and radiation feedback if the winds are not active. While they are active, stellar winds from the clustered stars sculpt the surrounding molecular cloud into pillars within the giant bubble around $\eta$~Carina.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an approach to detecting (linear) gravitational wave memory in a Galactic core-collapse supernova using current interferometers. Gravitational wave memory is an important prediction of general relativity that has yet to be confirmed. Our approach uses a combination of Linear Prediction Filtering and Matched-Filtering. We present the results of our approach on data from core-collapse supernova simulations that span a range of progenitor mass and metallicity. We are able to detect gravitational wave memory out to 10 kpc. We also present the False Alarm Probabilities assuming an On-Source Window compatible with the presence of a neutrino detection.
#### Probing the Physics of Star-Formation (ProPStar): II. The first  systematic search for streamers toward protostars

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of narrow channels of accretion toward protostellar disks, known as streamers, have increased in number in the last few years. However, it is unclear if streamers are a common feature around protostars that were previously missed, or if they are a rare phenomenon. Our goals are to obtain the incidence of streamers toward a region of clustered star formation and to trace the origins of their gas, to determine if they originate within the filamentary structure of molecular clouds or from beyond. We used combined observations of the nearby NGC 1333 star-forming region, carried out with the NOEMA interferometer and the IRAM 30m single dish. Our observations cover the area between the IRAS 4 and SVS 13 systems. We traced the chemically fresh gas within NGC 1333 with HC3N molecular gas emission and the structure of the fibers in this region with N2H+ emission. We fit multiple velocity components in both maps and used clustering algorithms to recover velocity-coherent structures. We find streamer candidates toward 7 out of 16 young stellar objects within our field of view. This represents an incidence of approximately 40\% of young stellar objects with streamer candidates when looking at a clustered star forming region. The incidence increases to about 60\% when we considered only embedded protostars. All streamers are found in HC3N emission. Given the different velocities between HC3N and N2H+ emission, and the fact that, by construction, N2H+ traces the fiber structure, we suggest that the gas that forms the streamers comes from outside the fibers. This implies that streamers can connect cloud material that falls to the filaments with protostellar disk scales.
