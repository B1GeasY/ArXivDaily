#### Single Millisecond Pulsars from Dynamical Interaction Processes in Dense  Star Clusters

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) are particularly efficient at forming millisecond pulsars. Among these pulsars, about half lack a companion star, a significantly higher fraction than in the Galactic field. This fraction increases further in some of the densest GCs, especially those that have undergone core collapse, suggesting that dynamical interaction processes play a key role. For the first time, we create N-body models that reproduce the ratio of single-to-binary pulsars in Milky-Way-like GCs. We focus especially on NGC 6752, a typical core-collapsed cluster with many observed millisecond pulsars. Previous studies suggested that an increased rate of neutron star binary disruption in the densest clusters could explain the overabundance of single pulsars in these systems. Here, we demonstrate that binary disruption is ineffective and instead we propose that two additional dynamical processes play the dominant role: (1) tidal disruption of main-sequence stars by neutron stars; and (2) gravitational collapse of heavy white-dwarf-binary merger remnants. Neutron stars formed through these processes may also be associated with fast radio bursts similar to those observed recently in an extragalactic GC.

 - **Abstract**
 In the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3), LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA have observed binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to redshifts $z_\mathrm{merge}\approx1$. Because gravitational waves (GWs) are inefficient at shrinking the binary orbit, some of these BBH systems likely experienced long delay times $\tau$ between the formation of their progenitor stars at $z_\mathrm{form}$ and their GW merger at $z_\mathrm{merge}$. The distribution of delay times predicted by isolated binary evolution resembles a power law $p(\tau)\propto\tau^{\alpha_\tau}$ with slope $-1\lesssim\alpha_\tau\lesssim-0.35$ and a minimum delay time of $\tau_\mathrm{min}=10$ Myr. We use these predicted delay time distributions to infer the formation redshifts of the $\sim70$ BBH events reported in GWTC-3 and measure the BBH progenitor formation rate out to $z_\mathrm{form}\approx3$. For our default $\alpha_\tau=-1$ delay time distribution, we find that GWTC-3 contains at least one system (with 90\% credibility) that formed earlier than $z_\mathrm{form}>3.2$. Comparing our inferred BBH progenitor rate to the star formation rate (SFR), we find that at $z_\mathrm{form}=3$, the number of BBH progenitor systems formed per stellar mass was $4.3^{+4.9}_{-3.6}\times10^{-6}M_\odot^{-1}$ and this yield dropped to $0.2^{+1.7}_{-0.2}\times10^{-6}M_\odot^{-1}$ by $z_\mathrm{form}=0$. We discuss implications of this measurement for the cosmic metallicity evolution, finding that for typical assumptions about the metallicity-dependence of the BBH yield, the average metallicity at $z_\mathrm{form}=3$ was $\langle\log_{10}(Z/Z_\odot)\rangle=-0.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$, although the inferred metallicity can vary by a factor of $\approx3$ for different assumptions about the BBH yield.
#### Fermi-LAT detection of A new starburst galaxy candidate: IRAS 13052-5711
 - **Authors:** Yunchuan Xiang, Qingquan Jiang, Xiaofei Lan
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16107
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.16107
 - **Abstract**
 A likely starburst galaxy (SBG), IRAS 13052-5711, which is the most distant SBG candidate discovered to date, was found by analyzing 14.4 years of data from the Fermi large-area telescope (Fermi-LAT). This SBG's significance level is approximately 6.55$\sigma$ in the 0.1-500 GeV band. Its spatial position is close to that of 4FGL J1308.9-5730, determined from the Fermi large telescope fourth-source Catalog (4FGL). Its power-law spectral index is approximately 2.1, and its light curve (LC) for 14.4 years has no significant variability. These characteristics are highly similar to those of SBGs found in the past. We calculate the SBG's star formation rate (SFR) to be 29.38 $\rm M_{\odot}\ yr^{-1}$, which is within the SFR range of SBGs found to date. Therefore, IRAS 13052-5711 is considered to be a likely SBG. In addition, its 0.1-500 GeV luminosity is (3.28 $\pm$ 0.67) $\times 10^{42}\ \rm erg\ s^{-1}$, which deviates from the empirical relationship of the $\gamma$-ray luminosity and the total infrared luminosity. We considered a hadronic model to explain the GeV spectrum of IRAS 13052-5711.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) High-mass star formation is far less understood than low-mass star formation. It entails molecular outflows, which disturb the protostellar clump. Studying these outflows and the shocked gas they cause is key for a better understanding of this process. This study aims to characterise the behaviour of molecular outflows in the most massive protostellar sources in the Southern Galaxy by looking for evolutionary trends and associating shocked gas with outflow activity. We present APEX SEPIA180 observations (beamwidth $\sim$36") of SiO outflow candidates of a sample of 32 luminous and dense clumps, candidates to harbouring Hot Molecular Cores. We study the SiO(4-3) line emission, an unambiguous tracer of shocked gas and recent outflow activity, the HCO$^+$(2-1) and H$^{13}$CO$^+$(2-1) lines. 78% of our sample present SiO emission. Nine of these also have wings in the HCO$^+$ line, indicating outflow activity. The SiO emission of these 9 sources is more intense and wider than the rest, suggesting that the outflows in this group are faster and more energetic. Three positive correlations between the outflow properties were found, which suggest that more energetic outflows bear to mobilise more material. No correlation was found between the evolutionary stage indicator $L/M$ and SiO outflow properties, supporting that outflows happen throughout the whole high-mass star formation process. We conclude that sources with both SiO emission and HCO$^+$ wings and sources with only SiO emission are in virtually the same advanced stage of evolution in the high-mass star formation process. The former present more massive and more powerful SiO outflows than the latter. Thus, looking for more outflow signatures such as HCO$^+$ wings could help identify more massive and active massive star-forming regions in samples of similarly evolved sources, as well as sources with older outflow activity.
#### 2D Convolutional Neural Network for Event Reconstruction in IceCube  DeepCore

 - **Abstract**
 IceCube DeepCore is an extension of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory designed to measure GeV scale atmospheric neutrino interactions for the purpose of neutrino oscillation studies. Distinguishing muon neutrinos from other flavors and reconstructing inelasticity are especially difficult tasks at GeV scale energies in IceCube DeepCore due to sparse instrumentation. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been found to have better success at neutrino event reconstruction than conventional likelihood-based methods. In this contribution, we present a new CNN model that exploits time and depth translational symmetry in IceCube DeepCore data and present the model's performance, specifically for flavor identification and inelasticity reconstruction.
#### Discovery of the shell structure via break radii in the outer halo of  the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the \textit{Gaia} DR3 RR Lyrae catalog, we use two methods to fit the density profiles with an improved broken power law, and find that there are two break radii coinciding with the two apocenter pile-ups of high-eccentricity Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger. Also, there is a break caused by the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream. Combining the positions of all breaks, we briefly analyze the metallicity and its dispersion as a function of $r$ as well as its distribution in cylindrical coordinates. For the clean sample, the $z\text{-to-}x$ ellipsoid axial ratio $q$ in $36\,{\rm kpc}\,\textless\,r\,\textless\,96\,{\rm kpc}$ becomes much smaller than that of the inner halo $(r\,\textless\,36\,{\rm kpc})$, while the major axis has a large uncertainty in the region of $36-66\,{\rm kpc}$ and the one in the region of $66-96\,{\rm kpc}$ is obviously different from that dominated by the Hercules-Aquila Cloud (HAC) and the Virgo Overdensity (VOD) in the inner halo, which indicates that there is an over-density structure distributed at low zenithal angles. Finally, we found that the over-density structure in the outer halo ($r\,\textgreater\,50\,{\rm kpc}$) is shell-shaped and relatively metal-rich compared to the outer background halo. We conclude that the shells could be the apocenter pile-ups of the high-eccentricity GSE merger, which is supported by previous numerical simulations.
