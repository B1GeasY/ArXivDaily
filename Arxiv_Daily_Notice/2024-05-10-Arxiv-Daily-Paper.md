          Torsion-rotational transitions in methanol as a probe of fundamental physical constants -- electron and proton masses

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the using of torsion-rotational transitions in the CH3OH and (13)CH3OH molecules to evaluate possible variations of the physical constant mu=m_e/m_p - the electron-to-proton mass ratio - from spectral observations of emission lines detected in the microwave range towards the dense molecular cloud Orion-KL. An estimate of the upper limit on the relative changes in mu is obtained by two independent ways - with (13)CH3OH lines and with the combination of (13)CH3OH and CH3OH lines. The calculated upper limit Delta mu/mu < 1.1*10^{-8} (1 sigma) is in line with the most stringent constraints on the variability of fundamental physical constants established by other astrophysical methods.

 - **Abstract**
 We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2023fyq, a type Ibn supernova in the nearby galaxy NGC 4388 (D$\simeq$18~Mpc). In addition, we trace long-standing precursor emission at the position of SN 2023fyq using data from DLT40, ATLAS, ZTF, ASAS-SN, Swift, and amateur astronomer Koichi Itagaki. Precursor activity is observed up to nearly three years before the supernova explosion, with a relatively rapid rise in the final 100 days. The double-peaked post-explosion light curve reaches a luminosity of $\sim10^{43}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. The strong intermediate-width He lines observed in the nebular spectrum of SN 2023fyq imply the interaction is still active at late phases. We found that the precursor activity in SN 2023fyq is best explained by the mass transfer in a binary system involving a low-mass He star and a compact companion. An equatorial disk is likely formed in this process ($\sim$0.6$\rm M_{\odot}$), and the interaction of SN ejecta with this disk powers the main peak of the supernova. The early SN light curve reveals the presence of dense extended material ($\sim$0.3$\rm M_{\odot}$) at $\sim$3000$\rm R_{\odot}$ ejected weeks before the SN explosion, likely due to final-stage core silicon burning or runaway mass transfer resulting from binary orbital shrinking, leading to rapid rising precursor emission within $\sim$30 days prior to explosion. The final explosion could be triggered either by the core-collapse of the He star or by the merger of the He star with a compact object. SN 2023fyq, along with SN 2018gjx and SN 2015G, forms a unique class of Type Ibn SNe which originate in binary systems and are likely to exhibit detectable long-lasting pre-explosion outbursts with magnitudes ranging from $-$10 to $-$13.

          Starspots and Undetected Binary Stars Have Distinct Signatures in Young Stellar Associations

 - **Abstract**
 Young stars form in associations, meaning that young stellar associations provide an ideal environment to measure the age of a nominally coeval population. Isochrone fitting, which is the typical method for measuring the age of a coeval population, can be impacted by observational biases that obscure the physical properties of a population. One feature in isochrone fits of star-forming regions is an apparent mass-dependent age gradient, where lower-mass stars appear systematically younger than higher-mass stars. Starspots and stellar multiplicity are proposed mechanisms for producing the mass-dependent age gradient, but the relative importance of starspots versus multiplicity remains unclear. We performed a synthetic red-optical low-resolution spectroscopic survey of a simulated analog to a 10 Myr stellar association including mass-dependent multiplicity statistics and age-dependent starspot coverage fractions. We found that undetected starspots alone do not produce an apparent mass-dependent age gradient, but instead uniformly reduce the average measured age of the population. We also found that binaries continue to produce an apparent mass-dependent age gradient, and introduce more scatter in the age measurement than spots, but are easily removed from the population as long as there are good distance measurements to each target. We conclude that it is crucial to incorporate treatments of both starspots and undetected stellar multiplicity into isochrone fits of young stellar associations to attain reliable ages.

          Formation and Evolution of Transient Prominence Bubbles Driven by Erupting Mini-filaments

 - **Abstract**
 Prominence bubbles, the dark arch-shaped "voids" below quiescent prominences, are generally believed to be caused by the interaction between the prominences and the slowly-emerging or quasi-stable underlying magnetic loops. However, this scenario could not explain some short-lived bubbles with extremely dynamic properties of evolution. Based on high-resolution H$\alpha$ observations, here we propose that bubbles should be classified into two categories according to their dynamic properties: quasi-steady (Type-I) bubbles and transient (Type-II) bubbles. Type-I bubbles could remain relatively stable and last for several hours, indicating the existence of a quasi-stable magnetic topology, while Type-II bubbles grow and collapse quickly within one hour without stability duration, which are usually associated with erupting mini-filaments. Analysis of several typical Type-II bubbles from different views, especially including an on-disk event, reveals that Type-II bubbles quickly appear and expand at a velocity of $\thicksim$5--25 km s$^{-1}$ accompanied by an erupting mini-filament below. The mini-filament's rising velocity is slightly larger than that of the Type-II bubbles' boundary, which will lead to the collision with each other in a short time, subsequent collapse of Type-II bubbles, and formation of a large plume into the above prominence. We also speculate that only if the angle between the axis of the erupting mini-filament and the line-of-sight is large enough, the interaction between the erupting mini-filament and the overlying prominence could trigger a Type-II bubble with a typical arch-shaped but quickly-expanding bright boundary.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal Holes (CHs) are large-scale, low-density regions in the solar atmosphere which may expel high-speed solar wind streams that incite hazardous, geomagnetic storms. Coronal and solar wind models can predict these high-speed streams and the performance of the coronal model can be validated against segmented CH boundaries. We present a novel method named Sub-Transition Region Identification of Ensemble Coronal Holes (STRIDE-CH) to address prominent challenges in segmenting CHs with Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) imagery. Ground-based, chromospheric He I 10830 Å line imagery and underlying Fe I photospheric magnetograms are revisited to disambiguate CHs from filaments and quiet Sun, overcome obscuration by coronal loops, and complement established methods in the community which use space-borne, coronal EUV observations. Classical computer vision techniques are applied to constrain the radiative and magnetic properties of detected CHs, produce an ensemble of boundaries, and compile these boundaries in a confidence map that quantifies the likelihood of CH presence throughout the solar disk. This method is science-enabling towards future studies of CH formation and variability from a mid-atmospheric perspective.

          Bayesian Black Hole Photogrammetry

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a simple, analytic dual-cone accretion model for horizon scale images of the cores of Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGN), including those observed by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Our underlying model is of synchrotron emission from an axisymmetric, magnetized plasma, which is constrained to flow within two oppositely oriented cones that are aligned with the black hole's spin axis. We show that this model can accurately reproduce images for a variety of time-averaged general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, that it accurately recovers both the black hole and emission parameters from these simulations, and that it is sufficiently efficient to be used to measure these parameters in a Bayesian inference framework with radio interferometric data. We show that non-trivial topologies in the source image can result in non-trivial multi-modal solutions when applied to observations from a sparse array, such as the EHT 2017 observations of M87${}^*$. The presence of these degeneracies underscores the importance of employing Bayesian techniques that adequately sample the posterior space for the interpretation of EHT measurements. We fit our model to the EHT observations of M87${}^*$ and find a 95% Highest Posterior Density Interval (HPDI) for the mass-to-distance ratio of $\theta_g\in(2.84,3.75)\,\mu{\rm as}$, and give an inclination of $\theta_{\rm o}\in(11^\circ,24^\circ)$. These new measurements are consistent with mass measurements from the EHT and stellar dynamical estimates (e.g., Gebhardt et al. 2011; EHTC et al. 2019a,b; Liepold et al. 2023), and with the spin axis inclination inferred from properties of the M87${}^*$ jet (e.g., Walker et al. 2018).

          Multiwavelength observations of a breakout jet at an active region periphery

 - **Abstract**
 We analysed Interface-Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) observations of a small coronal jet that occurred at the solar west limb on 2014 August 29. The jet source region, a small bright point, was located at an active-region periphery and contains a fan-spine topology with a mini-filament. Our analysis has identified key features and timings that motivate the following interpretation of this event. As the stressed core flux rises, a current sheet forms beneath it; the ensuing reconnection forms a flux rope above a flare arcade. When the rising filament-carrying flux rope reaches the stressed null, it triggers a jet via explosive interchange (breakout) reconnection. During the flux-rope interaction with the external magnetic field, we observed brightening above the filament and within the dome, along with a growing flare arcade. EUV images reveal quasi-periodic ejections throughout the jet duration with a dominant period of 4 minutes, similar to coronal jetlets and larger jets. We conclude that these observations are consistent with the magnetic breakout model for coronal jets.

 - **Abstract**
 We review the phenomenology of classical Cepheids (CCs), Anomalous Cepheids (ACs) and type II Cepheids (TIICs) in the Milky Way (MW) and in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs). We also examine the Hertzsprung progression in different stellar systems by using the shape of I-band light curves (Fourier parameters) and observables based on the difference in magnitude and in phase between the bump and the minimum in luminosity. The distribution of Cepheids in optical and in optical-near infrared (NIR) color--magnitude diagrams is investigated to constrain the topology of the instability strip. The use of Cepheids as tracers of young (CCs), intermediate (ACs) and old (TIICs) stellar populations are brought forward by the comparison between observations (MCs) and cluster isochrones covering a broad range in stellar ages and in chemical compositions. The different diagnostics adopted to estimate individual distances (period--luminosity, period--Wesenheit, period--luminosity--color relations) are reviewed together with pros and cons in the use of fundamental and overtones, optical and NIR photometric bands, and reddening free pseudo magnitudes (Wesenheit). We also discuss the use of CCs as stellar tracers and the radial gradients among the different groups of elements (iron, alpha, neutron-capture) together with their age-dependence. Finally, we briefly outline the role that near-future space and ground-based facilities will play in the astrophysical and cosmological use of Cepheids.

          The dynamical age of the LMC globular cluster NGC 1835 using the "dynamical clock"

 - **Abstract**
 In the context of the study of the size-age relationship observed in star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud and the investigation of its origin, here we present the determination of the structural parameters and the dynamical age of the massive cluster NGC 1835. We have used a powerful combination of optical and near-ultraviolet images acquired with the WFC3 onboard the HST to construct the star density profile from resolved star counts, determining the values of the core, half-mass and tidal radii through the comparison with the King model family. The same data also allowed us to evaluate the dynamical age of the cluster by using the 'dynamical clock'. This is an empirical method that quantifies the level of central segregation of blue stragglers stars (BSSs) within the cluster half-mass radius by means of the A+ parameter, which is defined as the area enclosed between the cumulative radial distribution of BSSs and that of a reference (lighter) population. The results confirm that NGC 1835 is a very compact cluster with a core radius of only 0.84 pc. The estimated value of A+ ($0.30\pm 0.04$) is the largest measured so far in the LMC clusters, providing evidence of a highly dynamically evolved stellar system. NGC 1835 nicely fits into the correlation between A+ and the central relaxation time and in the anti-correlation between A+ and the core radius defined by the Galactic and the Magellanic Cloud clusters investigated to date.

          A high-resolution radio morphology and polarization of the kpc-scale X-ray jet of PKS 1127-145

 - **Abstract**
 We report on new multi-frequency Very Large Array (VLA) radio observations and Chandra X-ray observations of a radio-loud quasar with a ~300 kpc long jet, PKS 1127-145, during a flaring event detected in $\gamma$-rays by the Fermi Large Area Telescope in 2020 December. The high angular resolution of the new radio images allows us to disentangle for the first time the inner kpc-scale jet from the core contribution. The inner radio jet, up to 15 kpc from the core, is highly polarized (33 per cent) and the magnetic field is parallel to the jet axis. At about 18 arcsec from the core the jet slightly bends and we observe a re-brightening of the radio emission and a 90-degree rotation of the magnetic field, likely highlighting the presence of a shock that is compressing the magnetic field to a plane perpendicular to the jet axis and where efficient particle acceleration takes place. At the same position the X-ray emission fades, suggesting a deceleration of the bulk velocity of the jet after the bend. A change in velocity and collimation of the jet is supported by the widening of the jet profile and the detection of a limb-brightened structure connecting the bending region with the jet termination. The limb-brightened structure might indicate the co-existence of both longitudinal and transverse velocity gradients at the jet bending. There is no evidence for significant brightening of the kpc-scale jet in the radio or X-ray band during the $\gamma$-ray flare. The X-ray flux, $F_{\rm 2-10\,keV} = (6.24\pm0.57)\times10^{-12}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, measured by Chandra from the quasar core is consistent with the flux measured by the X-Ray Telescope on board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory after the high-energy flare. Our results indicate that the $\gamma$-ray flaring region is located within the VLA source core.

          A dusty rain falls on the nova V959 Monocerotis

 - **Abstract**
 We present archival and ground-based infrared observations of the gamma-ray-emitting nova V959 Mon, covering the period 100-4205 days after the 2012 eruption. We use these data to determine that the secondary in the nova system is a G5 main sequence star. Data from the NEOWISE survey reveal a significant increase in the emission at 3.4 microns and 4.6 microns at late (>~600 days) times, which we interpret as emission by dust. Other interpretations are considered but cannot be reconciled with the data. The presence of such late dust emission, and in particular its variation with time, are unprecedented in the context of novae. The behaviour of the dust emission suggests a qualitative interpretation in which ejecta from the 2012 eruption encounter denser pre-eruption circumbinary material, giving rise to Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities that cause clumps of dust-bearing material to fall back towards the central binary, the dust undergoing destruction by chemisputtering as it does so. The observed rise in the dust temperature, the decline in the nova-dust distance and in the dust mass, are consistent with this interpretation. Not all novae are expected to show this behaviour, but inspection of resources such as NEOWISE might reveal other novae post-eruption that do.

          What role of gravity, turbulence and magnetic fields in high-mass star formation clouds?

 - **Abstract**
 To explore the potential role of gravity, turbulence and magnetic fields in high-mass star formation in molecular clouds, this study revisits the velocity dispersion--size ($\sigma$--$L$) and density--size ($\rho$--$L$) scalings and the associated turbulent energy spectrum using an extensive data sample. The sample includes various hierarchical density structures in high-mass star formation clouds, across scales of 0.01 to 100 pc. We observe $\sigma \propto L^{0.26}$ and $\rho \propto L^{-1.54}$ scalings, converging toward a virial equilibrium state. A nearly flat virial parameter--mass ($\alpha_{\rm vir}-M$) distribution is seen across all density scales, with $\alpha_{\rm vir}$ values centered around unity, suggesting a global equilibrium maintained by the interplay between gravity and turbulence across multiple scales. Our turbulent energy spectrum ($E(k)$) analysis, based on the $\sigma$--$L$ and $\rho$--$L$ scalings, yields a characteristic $E(k) \propto k^{-1.52}$. These findings indicate the potential significance of gravity, turbulence, and possibly magnetic fields all in regulating dynamics of molecular clouds and high-mass star formation therein.

          Implication of the velocity dispersion scalings on high-mass star formation in molecular clouds

 - **Abstract**
 This paper is aimed at exploring implications of velocity dispersion scalings on high-mass star formation in molecular clouds, including the scalings of Larson's linewidth--size ($\sigma$--$R$) and ratio--mass surface density ($\cal{L}$--$\Sigma$; here $\cal{L}$$=\sigma/R^{0.5}$). We have systematically analyzed the $\sigma$ parameter of well-selected 221 massive clumps, complemented with published samples of other hierarchical density structures of molecular clouds over spatial scales of 0.01--10 pc. Those massive clumps are classified into four phases: quiescent, protostellar, HII region, and PDR clumps in an evolutionary sequence. The velocity dispersion of clumps increases overall with the evolutionary sequence, reflecting enhanced stellar feedback in more evolved phases. The relations of $\sigma$--$R$ and $\cal{L}$--$\Sigma$ are weak with the clump sample alone, but become evident when combined with others spanning a much wider spatial scales. For $\sigma$--$R$, its tight relation indicates a kinematic connection between hierarchical density structures, supporting theoretical models of multiscale high-mass star formation. From the $\cal{L}$--$\Sigma$ relation, cloud structures can be found to transition from over-virial state ($\alpha_\mathrm{vir} > 2$) to sub-virial state ($\alpha_\mathrm{vir} < 2$) as they become smaller and denser, indicating a possible shift in the governing force from turbulence to gravity. This implies that the multiscale physical process of high-mass star formation hinges on the self-gravity of sub-virial molecular clouds. However, the influence of turbulence may not be dismissed until large-scale clouds attain a sub-virial state. This is pending confirmation from future multiscale kinematic observations of molecular clouds with uniform observing settings.

          Early and elongated epochs of planetesimal dynamo generation

 - **Abstract**
 Accreting in the first few Ma after Solar System formation, planetesimals record conditions in the protoplanetary disc and are the remnants of planetary formation processes. The meteorite paleomagnetic record carries key insights into the thermal history of planetesimals and their extent of differentiation. The current paradigm splits the paleomagnetic record into three magnetic field generation epochs: an early nebula field (<5Ma after CAI formation), followed by thermal dynamos (5-34 Ma after CAI formation), then a gap in dynamo generation, before the onset of core solidification and compositional dynamos. The split between these epochs has been defined using thermal evolution and dynamo generation models of planetesimals. Here we demonstrate these epochs are not as distinct as previously thought based on our refined thermal evolution model that includes more realistic parametrisations for mantle convection, non-eutectic core solidification and radiogenic $^{60}Fe$ in the core. Inclusion of $^{60}$ in the core brings forward the onset of dynamo generation to 1-2 Ma after CAI formation, which overlaps with the existence of the nebula field. The second epoch of dynamo generation begins prior to the onset of core solidification, suggesting this epoch is not purely compositionally driven. Planetesimal radius is the dominant control on dynamo generation, and the choice of reference viscosity can widen the gap between epochs of dynamo generation from 0-200 Ma. Overall, timings of different planetesimal magnetic field generation mechanisms are more variable. This alters the information we can glean from the meteorite paleomagnetic record about the early Solar System. Evidence for the nebula field requires more careful interpretation and young paleomagnetic remanences, for example in the pallasites, may not be evidence for planetesimal core solidification.

          XMM-Newton observations of the extragalactic microquasar S26 and their implications for PeV cosmic rays

 - **Abstract**
 The extragalactic microquasar S26 has the most powerful jets observed in accreting binaries, with a kinetic luminosity of $L_{\rm jet}\sim10^{40}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$. According to the jet-disk symbiosis model, this implies that the accretion power to the stellar black hole at the core of the system should be very super-Eddington, on the order of $L_{\rm acc}\sim L_{\rm jet}$. However, the observed X-ray flux of this system, measured by the \textit{Chandra} and \textit{XMM-Newton} telescopes, indicates an apparent very sub-Eddington accretion luminosity of $L_{\rm X}\approx 10^{37}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$, orders of magnitude smaller than the jet power. We present here a preliminary investigation of the relationship between jet and disk power, analyze an X-ray observation of S26 obtained with \textit{XMM-Newton}, and propose an explanation for the emission. We also examine the acceleration and distribution of the particles to discuss the feasibility of microquasars as potential PeVatron sources, exploring their ability to produce cosmic rays with energies of about 1 PeV or higher.
