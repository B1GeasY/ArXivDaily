 - **Abstract**
 The JWST has ushered in a new era of exoplanet transit spectroscopy. Among the JWST instruments, the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) has the most extensive set of configurations for exoplanet time series observations. The NIRSpec Prism and G395H grating represent two extremes in NIRSpec instrument modes, with the Prism spanning a wider spectral range (0.6-5.3 $\mu$m at lower resolution (R$\sim$100) compared to G395H (2.87-5.14 $\mu$m; R$\sim$2700). In this work, we develop a new data reduction framework, JexoPipe, to conduct a homogeneous assessment of the two NIRSpec modes for exoplanet spectroscopy. We use observations of the hot Saturn WASP-39 b obtained as part of the JWST Transiting Exoplanets ERS program to assess the spectral quality and stability between the two instrument modes at different epochs. We explore the noise sources, effect of saturation, and offsets in transmission spectra between the different instrument modes and also between the two G395H NRS detectors. We find an inter-detector offset in G395H of $\sim$ 40-50 ppm, consistent with recent studies. We find evidence for correlated noise in the Prism white light curve. We find the G395H spectrum to be of higher precision compared to the Prism at the same resolution. We also compare the JexoPipe spectra with those reported from other pipelines. Our work underscores the need for robust assessment of instrument performance and identification of optimal practices for JWST data reduction and analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Ring seismology has recently revealed the presence of internal gravity waves inside Saturn that extend up to 60% of Saturn's radius starting from the center, in what is recognized today as Saturn's stably-stratified dilute core. Similarly, gravity measurements on Jupiter suggest the existence of a dilute core of still poorly constrained radial extent. These cores are likely in a double-diffusive regime, which prompt the question of their long-term stability. Indeed, previous DNS (Direct Numerical Simulations) studies in triply-periodic domains have shown that, in some regimes, double-diffusive convection tends to spontaneously form shallow convective layers, which coarsen until the region becomes fully convective. In this letter, we study the conditions for layering in double-diffusive convection using different boundary conditions, in which temperature and composition fluxes are fixed at the domain boundaries. We run a suite of DNS varying microscopic diffusivities of the fluid and the strength of the initial stratification. We find that convective layers still form as a result of the previously discovered gamma-instability which takes place whenever the local stratification drops below a critical threshold that only depends on the fluid diffusivities. We also find that the layers grow once formed, eventually occupying the entire domain. Our work thus recovers the results of previous studies, despite the new boundary conditions, suggesting that this behavior is universal. The existence of Saturn's stably-stratified core, today, therefore suggests that this threshold has never been reached, which places a new constraint on scenarios for the planet's formation and evolution.

          General Relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of accretion flows through traversable wormholes

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first dynamical model of plasma accretion onto traversable wormholes by performing General Relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulations of the flow on both sides of the wormhole. We evolve the ideal MHD equations on a wormhole spacetime described by the spherically symmetric Simpson--Visser metric. The disk is initialized on one side of the wormhole and accretes onto the throat driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). We show that the inflowing plasma quickly settles in the throat and forms a hot, rotating cloud. The wormhole cloud acts as an engine in which gas coming from one side accumulates at the center, dissipates energy, and powers a mildly relativistic thermal wind toward the other side. Our novel predictions show that accreting wormholes behave very differently from black holes (BHs) in astrophysical environments. In particular, one mouth presents outflows without accretion signatures, contradicting the jet-disk symbiotic relation that holds for black holes.

          Structure of proper motions in a sunspot penumbra

 - **Abstract**
 We study the structure and evolution of the horizontal proper motions in a regular sunspot penumbra, very close to the solar disc center, in active region NOAA 11092 using a 48 min time sequences of blue continuum images recorded by Hinode/SOT in 2010 August 3. We apply local correlation tracking (LCT). The penumbra shows a slow (fast) flow field with an average speed of 0.2 (0.4) km/s starting at its middle towards the umbra (outer penumbral boundary) as an inward (outward) motion in accordance with previous findings. This behavior defines a continuous divergence line at the middle of the penumbra (r~2R_spot/3). A distorted ringlike feature with very slow flows (~50 m/s; zero-flow ring: ZFR) co-spatial with the divergence line is clearly seen. Deep intrusion of coordinated penumbral filaments into the umbra can cause the ZFR to be a) significantly displaced towards the umbra or b) discontinuous, showing considerable speeds there (~150 m/s). Where the ZFR shows discontinuity, the divergence line does not move toward the umbra. Also, because of the different evolutionary flows of adjacent penumbral filaments, the ZFR and the divergence line show a stable backward/forward displacement along itself during the 48 min observation. The radial variations of the azimuthally averaged brightness show a local bright ring with a weak contrast of 1% close to the ZFR. At the outer penumbra, we find that the converging filamentary flow occurs in a dark radial channel and the filamentary diverging flows are formed by the evolution of thin bright fibrils. Also, the large speeds at the penumbra boundary are produced by the displacement and/or the fragmentation of the bright fibrils in developing filamentary flows. In surrounding granulation, some divergence centers are strongly pushed away as a whole with an average speed of about 0.6 km/s by these developing filamentary flows.

          Protoplanetary Disks from Pre-Main Sequence Bondi-Hoyle Accretion

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary disks are routinely described as finite mass reservoirs left over by the gravitational collapse of the protostar, an assumption that strongly constrains both disk evolution and planet formation models. We propose a different scenario where protoplanetary disks of pre-main sequence stars are assembled primarily by Bondi-Hoyle accretion from the parent gas cloud. We demonstrate that Bondi-Hoyle accretion can supply not only the mass, but also the angular momentum necessary to explain the observed size of protoplanetary disks, and we predict the dependence of the disk specific angular momentum on the stellar mass. Our results are based on an analytical derivation of the scaling of the angular momentum in a turbulent flow, which we also confirm with a numerical simulation of supersonic turbulence. This new scenario for disk formation and evolution may alleviate a number of observational problems as well as compel major revisions of disk and planet formation models.

 - **Abstract**
 Angular dispersion functions are typically used to estimate the fluctuations in polarization angle around the mean magnetic field orientation in dense regions, such as molecular clouds. The technique provides accurate turbulent to regular magnetic field ratios, $\langle B_t^2\rangle^{1/2}/B_{pos}$, which are often underestimated by the classic Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. We assess the technique's suitability to characterize the turbulent and regular plane-of-sky magnetic field in low-density structures of the nearby interstellar medium (ISM), particularly when the turbulence outer scale, $\delta$, is smaller than the smallest scale observed, $\ell_{min}$. We use optical polarization maps of three intermediate-latitude fields ($|b| \gtrsim 7.\!\!^{\circ}5$) with dimensions of $0.\!\!^{\circ}3 \times 0.\!\!^{\circ}3$, sourced from the Interstellar Polarization Survey--General ISM (IPS-GI) catalog. We decomposed the HI emission detected by the Galactic All-Sky Survey (GASS) within our fields to estimate the multiphase ISM properties associated with the structure coupled to the magnetic field. We produced maps of the plane-of-sky magnetic field strength ($B_{pos}$), mass density ($\rho$), and turbulent velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{v,turb}$). In the regions with well-defined structures at $d<400$ pc, the average $B_{pos}$ ranges from ${\sim}3 \mu$G to ${\sim}9 \mu$G, depending on the method and physical properties. In the region where structures extend up to $1000$ pc, $B_{pos}$ varies from ${\sim}1 \mu$G to ${\sim}3 \mu$G. The results agree with previous estimations in the local, diffuse ISM. Finally, optical starlight polarization and thermal dust polarization at 353 GHz consistently reveal a highly regular plane-of-sky magnetic field orientation unfazed by diffuse dust structures observed at $12 \mu$m.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the nature of the short-term anomaly that appears in the lensing light curve of KMT-2023-BLG-1866. The anomaly was only partly covered due to its short duration, less than a day, coupled with cloudy weather conditions and restricted nighttime duration. Considering intricacy of interpreting partially covered signals, we thoroughly explore all potential degenerate solutions. Through this process, we identify three planetary scenarios that equally well account for the observed anomaly. These scenarios are characterized by the specific planetary parameters: $(s, q)_{\rm inner} = [0.9740 \pm 0.0083, (2.46 \pm 1.07) \times 10^{-5}]$, $(s, q)_{\rm intermediate} = [0.9779 \pm 0.0017, (1.56 \pm 0.25)\times 10^{-5}]$, and $(s, q)_{\rm outer} = [0.9894 \pm 0.0107, (2.31 \pm 1.29)\times 10^{-5}]$, where $s$ and $q$ denote the projected separation (scaled to the Einstein radius) and mass ratio between the planet and its host, respectively. We identify that the ambiguity between the inner and outer solutions stems from the inner-outer degeneracy, while the similarity between the intermediate solution and the others is due to an accidental degeneracy caused by incomplete anomaly coverage. Through Bayesian analysis utilizing the constraints derived from measured lensing observables and blending flux, our estimation indicates that the lens system comprises a very low-mass planet orbiting an early M-type star situated approximately (6.2 -- 6.5)~kpc from Earth in terms of median posterior values for the different solutions. The median mass of the planet host is in the range of (0.48 -- 0.51)~$M_\odot$, and that of the planet's mass spans a range of (2.6 -- 4.0)~$M_{\rm E}$, varying across different solutions. The detection of KMT-2023-BLG-1866Lb signifies the extension of the lensing surveys to very low-mass planets that have been difficult to be detected from earlier surveys.

          On the Flux-Intensity Relation of Molecular Clouds

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we report a study on the relationship between flux and intensity for molecular clouds. Our analysis is established on high-quality CO images from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) project. The new flux-intensity relation characterizes the flux variation of molecular clouds above specific intensity levels. We found that the flux-intensity relation exhibits two prominent features. First, the flux-intensity relation generally follows exponential shapes; secondly, hierarchical structures of molecular clouds are imprinted on flux-intensity relations. Specifically, 12CO flux-intensity relations are composed of one or more exponential segments, and for molecular clouds with segmented flux-intensity relations, the edge and the flux of the high-temperature component are strikingly consistent with 13CO emission. Further analysis shows that a similar relationship also exists between 13CO flux-intensity relations and C18O emission. The mean brightness temperature of molecular clouds is tightly associated with the decay rate of flux, the break temperature of exponential segments, and, to a certain extent, the flux fraction of the high-temperature component. Broadly, the flux-intensity relation of a molecular tracer, either in optically thick or in optically thin cases, has the capability to outline the silhouette of internal structures of molecular clouds, proving to be a potent tool for probing structures of molecular clouds.

          The $\gamma$-process nucleosynthesis in core-collapse supernovae II. Effect of the explosive recipe

 - **Abstract**
 The $\gamma$-process in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) can produce a number of neutron-deficient stable isotopes heavier than iron (p-nuclei). However, current model predictions do to not fully reproduce the solar abundances. We investigate the impact of different explosion energies and parameters on the nucleosynthesis of p-nuclei, by studying stellar models with different initial masses and CCSN explosions. We find that the total p-nuclei yields are only marginally affected by the CCSN explosion prescriptions if the $\gamma$-process production is already efficient in the stellar progenitors due to a C-O shell merger. In most of CCSN explosions from progenitors without C-O shell merger, the $\gamma$-process yields increase with the explosion energy up to an order of magnitude, depending on the progenitor structure and the CCSN prescriptions. The trend of the p-nuclei production with the explosion energy is more complicated if we look at the production of single p-nuclei. The light p-nuclei tend to be the most enhanced with increasing the explosion energy. In particular, for the CCSN models where the $\alpha$-rich freeze-out component is ejected, the yields of the lightest p-nuclei increase by up to three orders of magnitude. We provide the first extensive study using different sets of massive stars of the impact of varying CCSN explosion prescriptions on the production of the p-nuclei. Unlike previous expectations and recent results in the literature, we find that the average production of p-nuclei tends to increase with the explosion energy. We also confirm that the pre-explosive production of p-nuclei in C-O shell mergers is a robust result, independently from the subsequent explosive nucleosynthesis. A realistic range of variations in the evolution of stellar progenitors and in the CCSN explosions might boost the CCSN contribution to the galactic chemical evolution of p-nuclei.

 - **Abstract**
 Our purpose is to study the effect of binary companions located within the first 10 stellar radii from the primary AGB star. In this work, we target the mass-losing carbon star V Hydrae (V Hya), looking for signatures of its companion in the dust forming region of the atmosphere. The star was observed in the L- and N-bands with the VLTI/MATISSE instrument at low spectral resolution. We reconstructed images of V Hya's photosphere and surroundings using the two bands and compared our interferometric observables with VLTI/MIDI and VISIR archival data. To constrain the dust properties, we used DUSTY to model the spectral energy distribution. The star is dominated by dust emission in the L- and N- bands. The VISIR image confirms the presence of a large-scale dusty circumstellar envelope surrounding V Hya. The MATISSE reconstructed images show asymmetric and elongated structures in both infrared bands. In the L-band, we detected an elongated shape of approximately 15 mas, likely to be of photospheric origin. In the N-band, we found a 20 mas extension North-East from the star, and perpendicular to the L-band elongated axis. The position angle and the size of the N-band extension match the prediction of the companion position at MATISSE epoch. By comparing MATISSE N-band with MIDI data, we deduce that the elongation axis in the N-band has rotated since the previous interferometric measurements 13 years ago, supporting the idea that the particle enhancement is related to the dusty clump moving along with the companion. The MATISSE images unveil the presence of a dust enhancement at the companion position, opening new doors for further analysis on the binary interaction with an AGB component.

 - **Abstract**
 The solid-state C$_2$H$_2$ chemistry in interstellar H$_2$O-rich ice has been proposed to explain astronomically observed complex organic molecules (COMs), including ketene (CH$_2$CO), acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO), and ethanol (CH$_3$CH$_2$OH), toward early star-forming regions. This formation mechanism is supported by recent laboratory studies and theoretical calculations for the reactions of C$_2$H$_2$+OH/H. However, the analog reaction of C$_2$H$_2$+NH$_2$ forming N-bearing species has been suggested to have a relatively low rate constant that is orders of magnitude lower than the value of C$_2$H$_2$+OH. This work extends our previous laboratory studies on O-bearing COM formation to investigate the interactions between C$_2$H$_2$ and NH$_3$ ice triggered by cosmic ray-induced secondary UV photons under molecular cloud conditions. Experiments were performed in an ultra-high vacuum chamber to investigate the UV photolysis of the C$_2$H$_2$:NH$_3$ ice mixture at 10 K. The studied ice chemistry of C$_2$H$_2$ with NH$_2$ radicals and H atoms resulting from the UV photodissociation of NH$_3$ leads to the formation of several N-bearing COMs, including vinylamine (CH$_2$CHNH$_2$), acetaldimine (CH$_3$CHNH), acetonitrile (CH$_3$CN), ketenimine (CH$_2$CNH), and tentatively ethylamine (CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$). The experimental results show an immediate and abundant CH$_2$CHNH$_2$ yield as the first-generation product, which is further converted into other chemical derivatives. The effective destruction and formation cross-section values of parent species and COMs were derived, and we discuss the chemical links among these molecules and their astronomical relevance.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarization imaging can yield crucial information in multiple applications of remote sensing, such as characterization of clouds, aerosols, and the Aurora Borealis. Some applications require sub-percent polarimetric sensitivity and accuracy in determining the Stokes parameters, which can be a challenge to attain. In 2018, Sony released a low-cost CMOS-based imaging chip with integrated micro-polarizer array for general polarization measurements. We implement the calibration steps required for these Sony chips to reach sub-percent polarimetric accuracies. To analyze their performances, we have compared the characteristics of four different detector packages by three manufacturers housing either the monochromatic version or the RGB color variant. We present a comprehensive overview of the effects that these characteristics have on the polarimetric performance of the camera. They include dark noise, behavior over different gain settings, detector/pixel artifacts, and polarimetric effects determined by polarizer extinction ratios, polarizer orientations, and accuracy of polarimetric zero points due to differential pixel gains. In addition to calibrations using unpolarized light and fully linearly polarized light, we assess the polarimetric sensitivity within a tilting and rotating glass-plate set-up. We discuss the benefits of adding a rotating half-wave plate as an additional temporal modulator to generically mitigate some of the detector effects, and achieve better polarimetric sensitivity/accuracy albeit at the expense of lower temporal resolution. We conclude by presenting and discussing the polarimetric limits to which we were able to calibrate the detector effects for practical purposes. By reaching a compound absolute polarimetric uncertainty of less than a percent, these very compact, low-cost detectors are enabled for a multitude of scientific goals.
