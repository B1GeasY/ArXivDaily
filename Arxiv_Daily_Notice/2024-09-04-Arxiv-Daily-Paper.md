 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) are sites of extremely efficient star formation, and recent studies suggest they significantly contributed to the early Milky Way's stellar mass build-up. Although their role has since diminished, GCs' impact on the Galaxy's initial evolution can be traced today by identifying their most chemically unique stars--those with anomalous nitrogen and aluminum overabundances and oxygen depletion. While they are a perfect tracer of clusters, be it intact or fully dissolved, these high-[N/O], high-[Al/Fe] GC-origin stars are extremely rare within the current Galaxy. To address the scarcity of these unusual, precious former GC members, we train a neural network (NN) to identify high-[N/O], high-[Al/Fe] stars using low-resolution Gaia BP/RP spectra. Our NN achieves a classification accuracy of approximately $\approx99\%$ and a false positive rate of around $\approx7\%$, identifying 878 new candidates in the Galactic field. We validate our results with several physically-motivated sanity checks, showing, for example, that the incidence of selected stars in Galactic GCs is significantly higher than in the field. Moreover, we find that most of our GC-origin candidates reside in the inner Galaxy, having likely formed in the proto-Milky Way, consistent with previous research. The fraction of GC candidates in the field drops at a metallicity of [Fe/H]$\approx-1$, approximately coinciding with the completion of spin-up, i.e. the formation of the Galactic stellar disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding how stars form, evolve and impact molecular clouds is key to understanding why star formation is such an inefficient process globally. In this paper, we use the infrared bright fraction, $f_\text{IRB}$ (the fraction of a given molecular cloud that appears bright against the 8 $\mu$m Milky Way background) as a proxy for time evolution to test how cloud properties change as star formation evolves. We apply this metric to 12,000 high-mass star-forming molecular clouds we identify using the Herschel-Hi-GAL survey between $|l|<70^\circ$ on the Milky Way plane. We find clouds are not static while forming stars. Instead, molecular clouds continuously gain mass while star formation progresses. By performing principal component analysis on the cloud properties, we find that they evolve down two paths distinguished by their mass gain. Most clouds (80%) gain four times more mass as a function of $f_\text{IRB}$. The remaining 20% experience an extreme period of growth, growing in mass by a factor of 150 on average and during this period, they initially gain mass fast enough to outpace their star formation. For all clouds, it is only after half their area becomes star forming that mass loss occurs. We expect stellar feedback and potentially galactic shear is responsible. By analysing cloud positions, we suggest that the rate of mass growth may be linked to the larger galactic environment. Altogether, these results have strong implications on how we assess star forming ability on cloud scales when assuming molecular cloud masses are fixed in time.
#### The dark days are overcast: Iron-bearing clouds on HD 209458 b and WASP-43 b can explain low dayside albedos

 - **Abstract**
 We simulate the geometric albedo spectra of hot Jupiter exoplanets HD 209458 b and WASP-43 b, based on global climate model (GCMs) post-processed with kinetic cloud models. We predict WASP-43 b to be cloudy throughout its dayside, while HD 209458 b has a clear upper atmosphere around the hot sub-solar point, largely due to the inclusion of strong optical absorbers TiO and VO in the GCM for the latter causes a temperature inversion. In both cases our models find low geometric albedos - 0.026 for WASP-43b and 0.028 for HD 209458 b when averaged over the CHEOPS bandpass of 0.35 - 1.1 microns - indicating dark daysides, similar to the low albedos measured by observations. We demonstrate the strong impact of clouds that contain Fe-bearing species on the modelled geometric albedos; without Fe-bearing species forming in the clouds, the albedos of both planets would be much higher (0.518 for WASP-43 b, 1.37 for HD 209458 b). We conclude that a cloudy upper or mid-to-lower atmosphere that contains strongly absorbing Fe-bearing aerosol species, is an alternative to a cloud-free atmosphere in explaining the low dayside albedos of hot Jupiter atmospheres such as HD 209458 b and WASP-43 b.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first spatially resolved detection of the near-infrared [C I] $\lambda$8727 emission from the outer pair of low-ionization structures in the planetary nebula NGC 7009 from data obtained by the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer integral field unit. This atomic carbon emission marks the transition zone between ionized and neutral gas, and for the first time offers direct evidence that LISs are photodominated regions. The outer LIS pair exhibits intense [C I] $\lambda$8727 emission, but He I $\lambda$8733 is absent. Conversely, the inner pair of knots shows both lines, likely due to the host nebula emission. Furthermore, the [C I] $\lambda$8727 line is absent in the host nebula emission, but He I $\lambda$8733 is present. Although the origin of the [C I] $\lambda$8727 line is still debated, its detection supports the scenario of photoevaporated dense molecular clumps.
#### Probing the Physics of Star-Formation (ProPStar) III. No evidence for dissipation of turbulence down to 20 mpc (4 000 au) scale

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Turbulence is a key component of molecular cloud structure. It is usually described by a cascade of energy down to the dissipation scale. The power spectrum for subsonic incompressible turbulence is $k^{-5/3}$, while for supersonic turbulence it is $k^{-2}$. Aims. We aim to determine the power spectrum in an actively star-forming molecular cloud, from parsec scales down to the expected magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave cutoff (dissipation scale). Methods. We analyze observations of the nearby NGC 1333 star-forming region in three different tracers to cover the different scales from $\sim$10 pc down to 20 mpc. The largest scales are covered with the low density gas tracer $^{13}$CO (1-0) obtained with single dish, the intermediate scales are covered with single-dish observations of the C$^{18}$O (3-2) line, while the smallest scales are covered in H$^{13}$CO$^+$ (1-0) and HNC (1-0) with a combination of NOEMA interferometer and IRAM 30m single dish observations. The complementarity of these observations enables us to generate a combined power spectrum covering more than two orders of magnitude in spatial scale. Results. We derive the power spectrum in an active star-forming region spanning more than 2 decades of spatial scales. The power spectrum of the intensity maps shows a single power-law behavior, with an exponent of 2.9$\pm$0.1 and no evidence of dissipation. Moreover, there is evidence for the power-spectrum of the ions to have more power at smaller scales than the neutrals, which is opposite from theoretical expectations. Conclusions. We show new possibilities of studying the dissipation of energy at small scales in star-forming regions provided by interferometric observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We construct a semi-analytical model that describes the convective core mass evolution of massive stars experiencing mass loss during the main-sequence stage. We first conduct a suite of 1D stellar evolution calculations to build insight into how convective core masses behave under idealized mass loss. Based on these simulations, we find several universal relations between global properties of the star that hold regardless of the mass loss history. By combining these relations, we construct a semi-analytic framework that can predict the convective core mass evolution for arbitrary mass loss histories and hence the helium core mass at the end of the main sequence. Our formulae improve upon existing methods for predicting the core mass in rapid population synthesis codes.

 - **Abstract**
 The systematic analysis of the correlations between diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) is extended to weak DIBs through the comprehensive catalogue of the Apache Peak Observatory (APO) of 559 DIBs in 25 lines of sight with diverse interstellar properties. The main results are the following: 1) An extension of the number of DIBs identified to be related to C2, that is, those that need very shielded interstellar regions for their carriers to survive UV photo-dissociation. Based on the correlations with the reference C2 and zeta DIBs, anticorrelations with UV-favoured (sigma) DIBs, and the strength ratios in shielded and unshielded sight lines, we propose 12 new C2 candidates and 34 possible "C2-related" DIBs (mostly at lambda < 5950 A ) in addition to the ~20 known confirmed C2 DIBs. With these additions, the census of C2 DIBs might approach completion. 2) We discovered that the intensities of a large set of poorly studied DIBs are strongly enhanced in one or two of the sight lines of HD 175156 and HD 148579. This tentative class, denoted "chi" for the time being, might include up to 50-100 members, half at lambda > 6000 A , and a number of C2 DIBs. These possible enhancements might reflect specific formation processes of their carriers that are yet to be identified in the interstellar medium of these two sight lines. The possible matches of the wavelength of five very broad DIBs, including three "chi" DIBs, with the strong bands that were recently measured by action spectroscopy might favour some long carbon chains and rings as carriers of some DIBs. These correlations and findings justify further theoretical and laboratory efforts for improving our understanding of the complex physics, spectroscopy, and chemistry of the various carbon chains and rings, and their possible formation and destruction in the diffuse interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of exoplanets at different evolutionary stages can shed light on their formation, migration, and evolution. The determination of exoplanet properties depends on the properties of their host stars. It is therefore important to characterise the host stars for accurate knowledge on their planets. Our final goal is to derive, in a homogeneous and accurate way, the stellar atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances of ten young TESS transiting planet-hosting GK stars followed up with the HARPS-N at TNG spectrograph within the GAPS programme. We derived stellar kinematic properties, atmospheric parameters, and abundances of 18 elements. Lithium line measurements were used as approximate age estimations. We exploited chemical abundances and their ratios to derive information on planetary composition. Elemental abundances and kinematic properties are consistent with the nearby Galactic thin disk. All targets show C/O<0.8 and 1.0<Mg/Si<1.5, compatible with silicate mantles made of a mixture of pyroxene and olivine assemblages. The Fe/Mg ratios, with values of $\sim$0.7-1.0, show a propensity for the planets to have big (iron) cores. All stars hosting very low-mass planets show Mg/Si values consistent with the Earth values, thus demonstrating their similar mantle composition. Hot Jupiter host stars show a lower content of O/Si, which could be related to the lower presence of water content. We confirm a trend found in the literature between stellar [O/Fe] and total planetary mass, implying an important role of the O in shaping the mass fraction of heavy elements in stars and their disks. The detailed host star abundances provided can be employed for further studies on the composition of the planets within the current sample, when their atmospheres will be exploited.

 - **Abstract**
 Population III stars are characterized by extremely low metallicities as they are thought to be formed from a pristine gas in the early Universe. Although the existence of Population III stars is widely accepted, the lack of direct observational evidence hampers the study of the nature of the putative stars. In this article, we explore the possibilities of constraining the nature of the oldest stars by using the luminosity function of their remnants -- white dwarfs. We study the formation and evolution of white dwarf populations by following star formation in a Milky Way-like galaxy using the semi-analytic model A-SLOTH. We derive the white dwarf luminosity function by applying a linear Initial-Final Mass Relation and Mestel's cooling model. The obtained luminosity function is generally in agreement with available observations and theoretical predictions -- with an exponential increase to a maximum of Mabs = 16 and a sudden drop for Mabs > 16. We explore the uncertainties of our model and compare them to the observational estimates. We adopt two different models of the initial mass function of Population III stars to show that the faint end of the luminosity function imprints the signature of Population III remnants. If the feature is detected in future observations, it would provide a clue to Population III stars and would also be an indirect evidence of low- to intermediate-mass Population III stars. We discuss the challenges and prospects for detecting the signatures.

 - **Abstract**
 Ethanethiol (C$_2$H$_5$SH), a molecule detected in the interstellar medium (ISM), indicates the rich chemistry involving sulfur atoms. However, its behavior at low temperatures remains elusive, particularly the reported transition from an amorphous phase to a crystal. This study employs classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reproduce the liquid-state properties of ethanethiol and to simulate the initial amorphous state of ethanethiol films deposited on a KBr substrate. The amorphous ethanethiol did not show spontaneous crystallization upon increasing temperature. Also, ethanethiol ice crystals exhibit melting behavior on KBr substrate at elevated temperatures. Our MD simulations of thin ice samples do not show any signature reversible phase change. It will be interesting to continue this study with a thicker sample, which is beyond our current computational means. These findings underscore the complexity of icy mantle morphology on cold ISM dust grains.

 - **Abstract**
 The possibility of observing spectral features in exoplanet atmospheres with space missions like JWST and ARIEL necessitates the accurate modelling of cloud particle opacities. In exoplanet atmospheres, cloud particles can be made from multiple materials and be considerably chemically heterogeneous. Therefore, assumptions on the morphology of cloud particles are required to calculate their opacities. The aim of this work is to analyse how different approaches to calculate the opacities of heterogeneous cloud particles affect cloud particle optical properties. We calculate cloud particle optical properties using seven different mixing treatments: four effective medium theories (EMTs: Bruggeman, Landau-Lifshitz-Looyenga (LLL), Maxwell-Garnett, and Linear), core-shell, and two homogeneous cloud particle approximations. We study the mixing behaviour of 21 commonly considered cloud particle materials for exoplanets. To analyse the impact on observations, we study the transmission spectra of HATS-6b, WASP-39b, WASP-76b, and WASP-107b.Materials with large refractive indices, like iron-bearing species or carbon, can change the optical properties of cloud particles when they comprise less than 1\% of the total particle volume. The mixing treatment of heterogeneous cloud particles also has an observable effect on transmission spectroscopy. Assuming core-shell or homogeneous cloud particles results in less muting of molecular features and retains the cloud spectral features of the individual cloud particle materials. The predicted transit depth for core-shell and homogeneous cloud particle materials are similar for all planets used in this work. If EMTs are used, cloud spectral features are broader and cloud spectral features of the individual cloud particle materials are not retained. Using LLL leads to less molecular features in transmission spectra compared to Bruggeman.

 - **Abstract**
 Red Giant stars host solar-like oscillations which have mixed character, being sensitive to conditions both in the outer convection zone and deep within the interior. The properties of these modes are sensitive to both core rotation and magnetic fields. While asteroseismic studies of the former have been done on a large scale, studies of the latter are currently limited to tens of stars. We aim to produce the first large catalogue of both magnetic and rotational perturbations. We jointly constrain these parameters by devising an automated method for fitting the power spectra directly. We successfully apply the method to 302 low-luminosity red giants. We find a clear bimodality in core rotation rate. The primary peak is at $\delta \nu_{\mathrm{rot}}$ = 0.32 $\mu$Hz, and the secondary at $\delta \nu_{\mathrm{rot}}$ = 0.47 $\mu$Hz. Combining our results with literature values, we find that the percentage of stars rotating much more rapidly than the population average increases with evolutionary state. We measure magnetic splittings of 2$\sigma$ significance in 23 stars. While the most extreme magnetic splitting values appear in stars with masses > 1.1M$_{\odot}$, implying they formerly hosted a convective core, a small but statistically significant magnetic splitting is measured at lower masses. Asymmetry between the frequencies of a rotationally split multiplet has previously been used to diagnose the presence of a magnetic perturbation. We find that of the stars with a significant detection of magnetic perturbation, 43\% do not show strong asymmetry. We find no strong evidence of correlation between the rotation and magnetic parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular line emissions are commonly used to trace the distribution and properties of molecular Interstellar Medium (ISM). However, the emissions are heavily blended on the Galactic disk toward the inner Galaxy because of the relatively large line widths and the velocity overlaps of spiral arms. Structure identification methods based on voxel connectivity in PPV data cubes often produce unrealistically large structures, which is the ``over-linking'' problem. Therefore, identifying molecular cloud structures in these directions is not trivial. We propose a new method based on Gaussian decomposition and graph theory to solve the over-linking problem, named ISMGCC (InterStellar Medium Gaussian Component Clustering). Using the MWISP ${}^{13}\mathrm{CO}~(1-0)$ data in the range of $13.5^{\circ} \leq l \leq 14.5^{\circ}, |b| \leq 0.5^{\circ}$, and $-100\leq V_{\mathrm{LSR}} \leq +200~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$, our method identified three hundred molecular gas structures with at least 16 pixels. These structures contain $92\%$ of the total flux in the raw data cube. Meanwhile, these structures show single-peaked line profiles on more than $93\%$ of their pixels. This indicates that the ISMGCC method could distinguish gas structures in crowded regions with minimal flux loss.

 - **Abstract**
 Ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH) has recently been identified in the molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027, situated in the SgrB2 complex in the Galactic center. However, its presence in other regions, and in particular in star-forming sites, is still elusive. Given its likely role as a precursor to simple amino acids, understanding its presence in the star-forming region is required. Here, we present the experimentally obtained temperature-dependent spectral features and morphological behavior of pure ethanolamine ices under astrochemical conditions in the 2 - 12 micro meter (MIR) and 120 - 230 nm (VUV) regions for the first time. These features would help in understanding its photochemical behavior. In addition, we present the first chemical models specifically dedicated to ethanolamine. These models include all the discussed chemical routes from the literature, along with the estimated binding energies and activation energies from quantum chemical calculations reported in this work. We have found that surface reactions: CH2OH + NH2CH2 --> NH2CH2CH2OH and NH2 + C2H4OH --> NH2CH2CH2OH in warmer regions (60-90 K) could play a significant role in the formation of ethanolamine. Our modeled abundance of ethanolamine complements the upper limit of ethanolamine column density estimated in earlier observations in hot core/corino regions. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical estimation of the rotational and distortional constants for various species (such as HNCCO, NH2CHCO, and NH2CH2CO) related to ethanolamine that have not been studied in existing literature. This study could be valuable for identifying these species in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 The Herschel observations unveiled the complex organisation of the interstellar medium in networks of parsec-scale filaments over the past decade. At the same time, networks of fibers have been recognised describing the gas structures in star-forming regions at sub-parsec scales. We aim to investigate the dense gas organisation prior to the formation of stars in sample of 7 star-forming regions within Orion. This EMERGE Early ALMA Survey includes OMC-1/-2/-3/-4 South, LDN 1641N, NGC 2023, and the Flame Nebula, all surveyed at high spatial resolution (4.5'' or $\sim2000$ au) in N$_2$H$^+$ (1$-$0) using ALMA+IRAM-30m observations. We systematically investigated the star-forming gas spatial distribution, its column density variations, its thermal structure, and its internal motions in a wide range of environments. From the analysis of the gas kinematics, we identified and characterised a total of 152 velocity-coherent fibers in our survey, which appear to be the preferred organisational unit for the dense gas in low-, intermediate- and high-mass star-forming regions alike. Despite the uneven density of fibers within these sub-parsec networks, the masses and lengths of these objects show similar distributions and consistent median values, as well as (trans-)sonic motions, in all of our targets. The comparison between the fiber line masses and virial line masses suggests the majority of these objects to be sub-virial. Those fibers closer to the virial condition, however, also have the most protostars associated to them, proving to be intimately connected to star formation. Finally, the surface density of fibers is linearly correlated with the total dense gas mass throughout roughly one order of magnitude in both parameters. These findings demonstrate how the formation and evolution of fibers networks can explain the current star formation properties of their host region.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of a low-density planet transiting TOI-5688 A b, a high-metallicity M2V star. This planet was discovered as part of the search for transiting giant planets ($R \gtrsim8$ M$_\oplus$) through the Searching for GEMS (Giant Exoplanets around M-dwarf Stars) survey. The planet TOI-5688 A b was discovered with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and characterized with ground-based transits from Red Buttes Observatory (RBO), the Table Mountain Observatory of Pomona College, and radial velocity (RV) measurements with the Habitable-Zone Planet Finder (HPF) on the 10 m Hobby Eberly Telescope (HET) and NEID on the WIYN 3.5 m telescope. From the joint fit of transit and RV data, the mass of the planet is $124\pm24$ M$_\oplus$ and the radius is $10.4\pm0.7$ R$_\oplus$. This planet has a density of $0.61^{+0.20}_{-0.15}$ g/cm${}^3$, and is on a $\sim2.95$ day orbit around its host star. The spectroscopic and photometric analysis of the host star TOI-5688 A shows that it is a high metallicity ([Fe/H] $ = 0.47\pm0.16$ dex) M2V star, favoring the core-accretion formation pathway as the likely formation scenario for this planet. In this paper, we analyze potential mechanisms of planet formation in the context of the formation of TOI-5688 A b. Additionally, observations with Gaia suggest the presence of a wide-separation binary companion, TOI-5688 B, which has a projected separation of $\sim5"$ (1110 AU) and is an M4V.

 - **Abstract**
 The Canis Major (CMa) region is known for its prominent arc-shaped morphology, visible at multiple wavelengths. This study integrates molecular gas data with high-precision astrometric parameters of young stellar objects (YSOs) from Gaia DR3 to provide the first three-dimensional (3D) insights into the dynamical evolution and star formation history of the CMa region. By utilizing the average distances and proper motions of the YSOs as proxies for those of the molecular clouds (MCs), we confirm the presence of a slowly expanding shell-like morphology in the CMa region, with the estimated radius of 47$\pm$11 pc and expansion velocity of 1.6$\pm$0.7 km/s. Further, the dynamical evolution of the shell supports its expansion, with an expansion timescale of $\sim$4.4 Myr obtained by the traceback analysis assuming constant velocities. Finally, a momentum estimate suggests that at least 2 supernova explosions (SNe) are needed to power the observed expanding shell, reinforcing the previous hypothesis of multiple SNe events. This study effectively combines the CO data with the astrometric data of YSOs from Gaia, offering significant support for the future studies on the 3D morphology and kinematics of MCs.

 - **Abstract**
 H2CO is a ubiquitous molecule in the ISM and in the gas phase of prestellar cores, and is likely present in ice mantles, but its main desorption mechanism is unknown. In this paper our aim is to quantify the desorption efficiency of H2CO upon cosmic-ray impact in order to determine whether cosmic-ray induced sputtering could account for the H2CO abundance observed in prestellar cores. Using a heavy-ion beam as a cosmic-ray analogue at the GANIL accelerator, we irradiated pure H2CO ice films at 10 K under high vacuum conditions and monitored the ice film evolution with infrared spectroscopy and the composition of the sputtered species in the gas phase using mass spectrometry. We derived both the effective and intact sputtering yield of pure H2CO ices. We find that H2CO easily polymerises under heavy-ion irradiation in the ice, and is also radiolysed into CO and CO2. In the gas phase, the dominant sputtered species is CO and intact H2CO is only a minor species. We determine an intact sputtering yield for pure H2CO ices $2.5\times 10^3$ molecules ion$^{-1}$ for an electronic stopping power of $S_e\sim2830$ eV ($10^{15}$ molecules cm$^{-2}$)$^{-1}$. The corresponding cosmic-ray sputtering rate is $\Gamma_\mathrm{CRD}=1.5\times 10^{-18}\zeta$ molecules cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, where $\zeta$ is the rate of cosmic-ray ionisation of molecular hydrogen in the ISM. In the frame of a simple steady-state chemical model of freeze-out and non-thermal desorption, we find that this experimental cosmic-ray sputtering rate is too low (by an order of magnitude) to account for the observed H2CO gas-phase abundance we derived in the prestellar core L1689B. We find however that this abundance can be reproduced if we assume that H2CO diluted in CO or CO2 ices co-desorbs at the same sputtering rate as pure CO or pure CO2 ices.

 - **Abstract**
 MICADO is a first-generation instrument for the ELT. It will provide diffraction-limited imaging in standard, astrometric, and coronagraphic modes and long-slit spectroscopy at near-infrared wavelengths. The core of the MICADO instrument is its cryostat, which cools the internal optical and mechanical subsystems to 80 K. Following a light ray entering the cryostat through the entrance window, the first mechanism it encounters is the Focal Plane Mechanism. It consists of two independent movable devices mounted in one assembly: the aperture wheel and the focal plane wheel. The primary purpose of the aperture wheel is to rapidly block the light path, which is needed to mitigate persistence on the detectors. The focal plane wheel holds field stops, calibration masks, slits, and coronagraphs. The positioning requirements for the wheel are dominated by the coronographic masks demanding a 15 $\mu$m RMS repeatability. To fulfill this specification and avoid mechanical wear in the drive, a novel magnetically coupled gear system was developed at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE). A magnetically coupled worm gear uses magnetic forces to transmit torque from the motor to the driven component without direct mechanical contact. This paper describes the design and performance of the magnetic drive and the first results of the focal plane wheel prototype tests in a cryogenic environment.

 - **Abstract**
 We used 3D maps of 862nm DIB equivalent width (EW) and extinction, DIB catalogues, and measured parameters of dust extinction law and dust emission to study relationships between DIB and extinction level, total-to-selective extinction ratio Rv, dust emission spectral index beta. We revisited the link between several DIBs and the 220nm absorption bump. The ratio, DIBn862, between the 862nm DIB carrier density and the extinction density is increasing in low density clouds, confirming with local values the line-of-sight data. A fitted power law ranks this DIB in the high increase range among the 20 bands measured toward SDSS targets. Using map-integrated 862nm DIB EWs and extinctions along the paths to APOGEE targets with proxies R'v for Rv, we found that DIBn862 increases with R'v for low to moderate extinctions (Av<2-3 mag). Based on stars outside the thin disk, DIBn862 is found to be globally anti-correlated with the Planck opacity spectral index beta. In the light of a recent result on the variability of the carbon/silicate ratio in dust grains as a source of the Rv-beta anti-correlation, it suggests that DIBn862 increases with this ratio, in agreement with the carbonaceous nature of carriers and recent evidences for a spatial correlation between DIBn862 and carbon-rich ejecta of AGBs. At higher Av, both trends disappear. We found that two factors explain the absence of clear results on the link between the UV absorption bump height and DIBs: the correlation disappears when we move from sigma- to zeta-type DIBs and/or from single-cloud lines of sight to paths crossing multiple clouds distant from each other. We show examples of simple models of the bump height based on DIBs. We found an anti-correlation between DIBn and the bump width, similarly disappearing from sigma- to zeta-type DIBs. This suggests that a fraction of the bump is generated outside the dense molecular clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 Long and skinny molecular filaments running along Galactic spiral arms are known as "bones", since they make up the skeleton of the Milky Way. However, their origin is still an open question. Here, we compare spectral images of HI taken by FAST with archival CO and Herschel dust emission to investigate the conversion from HI to H$_2$ in two typical Galactic bones, CFG028.68-0.28 and CFG047.06+0.26. Sensitive FAST HI images and an improved methodology enabled us to extract HI narrow self-absorption (HINSA) features associated with CO line emission on and off the filaments, revealing the ubiquity of HINSA towards distant clouds for the first time. The derived cold HI abundances, [HI]/[H$_2$], of the two bones range from $\sim$(0.5 to 44.7)$\times10^{-3}$, which reveal different degrees of HI-H$_2$ conversion and are similar to that of nearby, low-mass star forming clouds, Planck Galactic cold clumps and a nearby active high-mass star forming region G176.51+00.20. The HI-H$_2$ conversion has been ongoing for 2.2 to 13.2 Myr in the bones, a timescale comparable to that of massive star formation therein. Therefore, we are witnessing young giant molecular clouds with rapid massive star formation. Our study paves the way of using HINSA to study cloud formation in Galactic bones, and more generally, in distant giant molecular clouds, in the FAST era.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae are explosions of massive stars at the end of their evolution. They are responsible for metal production and for halting star formation, having a significant impact on galaxy evolution. The details of these processes depend on the nature of supernova progenitors, but it is unclear if Type Ic supernovae (without hydrogen or helium lines in their spectra) originate from core-collapses of very massive stars (> 30 Msun) or from less massive stars in binary systems. Here we show that Type II (with hydrogen lines) and Ic supernovae are located in environments with similar molecular gas densities, therefore their progenitors have comparable lifetimes and initial masses. This supports a binary interaction for most Type Ic supernova progenitors, which explains the lack of hydrogen and helium lines. This finding can be implemented in sub-grid prescriptions in numerical cosmological simulations to improve the feedback and chemical mixing.

 - **Abstract**
 In situ observations by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) have revealed new properties of the proton velocity distributions, including hammerhead features that suggest non-isotropic broadening of the beams. The present work proposes a very plausible explanation for the formation of these populations through the action of a proton firehose-like instability triggered by the proton beam. The quasi-linear (QL) theory proposed here shows that the resulting right-hand (RH) waves have two consequences on the protons: (i) reduce the relative drift between the beam and the core, but above all, (ii) induce a strong perpendicular temperature anisotropy, specific to the observed hammerhead ion strahl. Moreover, the long-run QL results suggest that these hammerhead distributions are rather transitory states, still subject to relaxation mechanisms, of which instabilities like the one discussed here are very likely involved.

 - **Abstract**
 Ground-based observations of Very High Energy (VHE) gamma rays from extreme astrophysical sources are significantly influenced by atmospheric conditions. This is due to the atmosphere being an integral part of the detector when utilizing Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). Clouds and dust particles diminish atmospheric transmission of Cherenkov light, thereby impacting the reconstruction of the air showers and consequently the reconstructed gamma-ray spectra. Precise measurements of atmospheric transmission above Cherenkov observatories play a pivotal role in the accuracy of the analysed data, among which the corrections of the reconstructed energies and fluxes of incoming gamma rays, and in establishing observation strategies for different types of gamma-ray emitting sources. The Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes and the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), both located on the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos (ORM), La Palma, Canary Islands, use different sets of auxiliary instruments for real-time characterisation of the atmosphere. In this paper, historical data taken by MAGIC LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) and CTAO FRAM (F/Photometric Robotic Telescope) are presented. From the atmospheric aerosol transmission profiles measured by the MAGIC LIDAR and CTAO FRAM aerosol optical depth maps, we obtain the characterisation of the clouds above the ORM at La Palma needed for data correction and optimal observation scheduling.

 - **Abstract**
 CMEs are one of the main drivers of space weather. However, robust and efficient numerical modeling of the initial stages of CME propagation and evolution process in the sub-Alfvenic corona is still lacking. Based on the highly efficient quasi-steady-state implicit MHD coronal model (Feng et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2022a), we further develop an efficient and time-accurate coronal model and employ it to simulate the CME's evolution and propagation. A pseudo-time marching method, where a pseudo time, tau, is introduced at each physical time step to update the solution by solving a steady-state problem on tau, is devised to improve the temporal accuracy. Moreover, an RBSL flux rope whose axis can be designed in an arbitrary shape is inserted into the background corona to trigger the CME event. We call it the SIP-IFVM coronal model and utilize it to simulate a CME evolution process from the solar surface to 20 Rs in the background corona of CR 2219. It can finish the CME simulation covering 6 hours of physical time by less than 0.5 hours (192 CPU cores, 1 M cells) without much loss in temporal accuracy. Besides, an ad hoc simulation with initial magnetic fields artificially increased shows that this model can effectively deal with time-dependent low-beta problems (beta<0.0005). Additionally, an Orszag-Tang MHD vortex flow simulation demonstrates that the pseudo-time-marching method adopted in this coronal model is also capable of simulating small-scale unsteady-state flows. The simulation results show that this MHD coronal model is very efficient and numerically stable and is promising to timely and accurately simulate time-varying events in solar corona with low plasma beta.

 - **Abstract**
 The elemental abundances of stars reflect the complex enrichment history of the galaxy. To explore and explain the metal enrichment history of the cosmic environment near our solar system, we study the evolution of $^{56} \mathrm{Fe}$ abundance over time and [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] evolution in the solar neighborhood. Core-collapse supernovae make the dominant contribution in the early stages, while Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have a delayed and dominant impact in the later stages. In this work, we consider the nucleosynthesis contribution of neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs) formed at the end of the lives of massive stars. The results show that the [Fe/H] gradually increases over time and eventually reaches $\rm [Fe/H]=0$ and above, reproducing the chemical enrichment process in the solar neighborhood. Before the onset of SNe Ia, the ratio of $^{56} \mathrm{Fe}$ mass to the total gas mass increases by a factor of at most $\sim 1.44$ when NDAFs are taken into account. We find that by including NDAF in our models, the agreement with the observed metallicity distribution of metal-poor stars in the solar neighborhood ($\rm < 1~kpc$) is improved, while not significantly altering the location of the metallicity peak. This inclusion can also reproduce the observed evolutionary change of [Mg/Fe] at [Fe/H] $\sim -1.22$, bringing the ratio to match the solar abundance. Our results provide an extensive understanding of metallicity evolution in the solar environments by highlighting the nucleosynthesis contribution of NDAF outflows in the solar neighborhood.

 - **Abstract**
 MHD coronal models are critical in the Sun-to-Earth model chain and the most complex and computationally intensive component, particularly the time-evolving coronal models, typically driven by a series of time-evolving photospheric magnetograms. There is an urgent need to develop efficient and reliable time-evolving MHD coronal models to further improve our ability to predict space weather. COCONUT is a rapidly developing MHD coronal model. Adopting the efficient implicit algorithm makes it suitable for performing computationally intensive time-evolving coronal simulations. This paper aims to extend COCONUT to an efficient time-evolving MHD coronal model. In this MHD model, as usual, an implicit temporal integration algorithm is adopted to avoid the CFL stability restriction and increase computational efficiency by large time steps. The Newton iteration method is applied within each time step to enhance the temporal accuracy. The unstructured geodesic mesh is used for flexibility in mesh division and to avoid degeneracy at the poles. Furthermore, an HLL Riemann solver with a self-adjustable dissipation term accommodates both low- and high-speed flows. A series of time-evolving photospheric magnetograms are utilized to drive the evolution of coronal structures from the solar surface to 25Rs during two Carrington rotations (CRs) around the 2019 eclipse in an inertial coordinate system. It shows that COCONUT can mimic the coronal evolution during a full CR within 9 hours (1080 CPU cores, 1.5M cells). We also compare the simulation results of time-evolving versus quasi-steady-state coronal simulations in the thermodynamic MHD model to validate the time-evolving approach. Additionally, we evaluate the effect of time steps on the simulation results to find an optimal time step that simultaneously maintains high efficiency and necessary numerical stability and accuracy.

 - **Abstract**
 The cores of stars are the cosmic furnaces where light elements are fused into heavier nuclei. The fusion of hydrogen to helium initially powers all stars. The ashes of the fusion reactions are then predicted to serve as fuel in a series of stages, eventually transforming massive stars into a structure of concentric shells. These are composed of natal hydrogen on the outside, and consecutively heavier compositions inside, predicted to be dominated by helium, carbon/oxygen, oxygen/neon/magnesium, and oxygen/silicon/sulphur. Silicon and sulphur are fused into inert iron, leading to the collapse of the core and either a supernova explosion or the direct formation of a black hole. Stripped stars, where the outer hydrogen layer has been removed and the internal He-rich layer (in Wolf-Rayet WN stars) or even the C/O layer below it (in Wolf-Rayet WC/WO stars) are exposed, provide evidence for this shell structure, and the cosmic element production mechanism it reflects. The types of supernova explosions that arise from stripped stars embedded in shells of circumstellar material (most notably Type Ibn supernovae from stars with outer He layers, and Type Icn supernovae from stars with outer C/O layers) confirm this scenario. However, direct evidence for the most interior shells, which are responsible for the production of elements heavier than oxygen, is lacking. Here, we report the discovery of the first-of-its-kind supernova arising from a star peculiarly stripped all the way to the silicon and sulphur-rich internal layer. Whereas the concentric shell structure of massive stars is not under debate, it is the first time that such a thick, massive silicon and sulphur-rich shell, expelled by the progenitor shortly before the SN explosion, has been directly revealed.

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular clouds are regions of dense gas and dust in space where new stars and planets are born. There is a strong correlation between the distribution of dust and molecular gas in molecular clouds. The present work focuses on the three-dimensional morphological comparisons between dust and gas within 567 molecular clouds identified in previously published catalog. We confirm a sample of 112 molecular clouds, where the cloud morphology based on CO observations and dust observations displays good overall consistency. There are up to 334 molecular clouds whose dust distribution might be related to the distribution of gas. We are unable to find gas structures that correlate with the shape of the dust distribution in 24 molecular clouds. For the 112 molecular clouds where the dust distribution correlates very well with the distribution of gas, we use CO observational data to measure the physical properties of these molecular clouds and compare them with the results derived from dust, exploring the correlation between gas and dust in the molecular clouds. We found that the gas and dust in the molecular clouds have a fairly good linear relationship, with a gas-to-dust ratio (GDR) of $\mathrm{GDR}=(2.80_{-0.34}^{+0.37})\times10^{21}\mathrm{\,cm^{-2}\, mag^{-1}}$. The ratio varies considerably among different molecular clouds. We measured the scale height of dust-CO clouds exhibiting strong correlations, finding $h_{Z} = 43.3_{-3.5}^{+4.0}\mathrm{\,pc}$.

 - **Abstract**
 In the age of gravitational-wave (GW) sources and newly discovered local black holes (BH) and neutron stars (NS), understanding the fate of stars is a key question. Not every massive star is expected to successfully explode as a supernova and leave behind a NS; some stars form BHs. The remnant depends on explosion physics but also on the final core structure, often summarized by the compactness parameter or iron core mass, where high values have been linked to BH formation. Several groups have reported similar patterns in these parameters as a function of mass, characterized by a prominent compactness peak followed by another peak at higher masses, pointing to a common underlying physical mechanism. Here, we investigate its origin by computing single-star models from 17 to 50 solar masses with MESA. The first and second compactness increases originate from core carbon and neon burning, respectively, becoming neutrino dominated, which enhances the core contraction and ultimately increases the iron-core mass and compactness. An early core neon ignition during carbon burning, and an early silicon ignition during oxygen burning help counter the core contraction and decrease the final iron core mass and compactness. Shell mergers between C/Ne and O-burning shells further decrease the compactness and we show that they are due to an enhanced entropy production in these layers. We find that the final structure of massive stars is not random but already written in their cores at core helium exhaustion. The same mechanisms determine the final structure of any star in this core mass range, including binary products, though binary interactions systematical shift the range of expected BH formation. Finally, we discuss the role of stellar physics uncertainties and how to apply these findings to studies of GW sources. [Abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 Uranus and Neptune have atmospheres dominated by molecular hydrogen and helium. In the upper troposphere, methane is the third main molecule and condenses, yielding a vertical gradient in CH4. This condensable species being heavier than H2 and He, the resulting change in mean molecular weight due to condensation comes as a factor countering dry and moist convection. As observations also show latitudinal variations in methane abundance, one can expect different vertical gradients from one latitude to another. In this paper, we investigate the impact of this methane vertical gradient on the atmospheric regimes, especially on the formation and inhibition of moist convective storms in the troposphere of ice giants. We develop a 3D cloud-resolving model to simulate convective processes. Using our simulations, we conclude that typical velocities of dry convection in the deep atmosphere are rather low (of the order of 1 m/s) but sufficient to sustain upward methane transport, and that moist convection at methane condensation level is strongly inhibited. Previous studies derived an analytical criterion on the methane vapor amount above which moist convection should be inhibited. We first validate this analytical criterion numerically. We then show that the critical methane abundance governs the inhibition and formation of moist convective storms, and we conclude that the intensity and intermittency of these storms should depend on the methane abundance and saturation. In ice giants, dry convection is weak, and moist convection is strongly inhibited. However, when enough methane is transported upwards, through dry convection and turbulent diffusion, sporadic moist convective storms can form. These storms should be more frequent on Neptune than on Uranus, because of Neptune's internal heat flow. Our results can explain the observed sporadicity of clouds in ice giants.
