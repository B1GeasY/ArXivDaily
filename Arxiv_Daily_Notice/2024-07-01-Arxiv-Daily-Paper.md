 - **Abstract**
 Fast and accurate approximations of gas cooling and heating functions are needed for hydrodynamic galaxy simulations. We use machine learning to analyze atomic gas cooling and heating functions in the presence of a generalized incident local radiation field computed by Cloudy. We characterize the radiation field through binned radiation field intensities instead of the photoionization rates used in our previous work. We find a set of 6 energy bins whose intensities exhibit relatively low correlation. We use these bins as features to train machine learning models to predict Cloudy cooling and heating functions at fixed metallicity. We compare the relative SHAP importance of the features. From the SHAP analysis, we identify a feature subset of 3 energy bins ($0.5-1, 1-4$, and $13-16 \, \mathrm{Ry}$) with the largest importance and train additional models on this subset. We compare the mean squared errors and distribution of errors on both the entire training data table and a randomly selected 20% test set withheld from model training. The machine learning models trained with 3 and 6 bins, as well as 3 and 4 photoionization rates, have comparable accuracy everywhere. We conclude that 3 energy bins (or 3 analogous photoionization rates: molecular hydrogen photodissociation, neutral hydrogen HI, and fully ionized carbon CVI) are sufficient to characterize the dependence of the gas cooling and heating functions on our assumed incident radiation field model.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first numerical study of gravitational waves (GWs) from collapsar disks, using state-of-the-art 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of collapsing stars. These simulations incorporate a fixed Kerr metric for the central black hole (BH) and employ simplified prescriptions for disk cooling. We find that cooled disks with an expected scale height ratio of $H/R\gtrsim0.1$ at $\sim10$ gravitational radii induce Rossby instability in compact, high-density rings. The trapped Rossby vortices generate vigorous coherent emission regardless of disk magnetization and BH spin. For BH mass of $\sim10\,M_\odot$, the GW spectrum peaks at $\sim100\,{\rm Hz}$ with some breadth due to various non-axisymmetric modes. The spectrum shifts toward lower frequencies as the disk viscously spreads and the circularization radius of the infalling gas increases. Weaker-cooled disks with $H/R\gtrsim0.3$ form a low-density extended structure of spiral arms, resulting in a broader, lower-amplitude spectrum. Assuming an optimistic detection threshold with a matched-filter SNR of 20 and a rate similar to supernovae Ib/c, LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) could detect $\lesssim1$ event annually, suggesting that GW events may already be hidden in observed data. Third-generation GW detectors could detect dozens to hundreds of collapsar disks annually, depending on the cooling strength and the disk formation rate. The GW amplitudes from collapsar disks are $\gtrsim100$ times higher with a substantially greater event rate than those from core-collapse supernovae, making them potentially the most promising burst-type GW class for LVK and Cosmic Explorer. This highlights the importance of further exploration and modeling of disk-powered GWs, promising insights into collapsing star physics.
#### Radio study of the Arc and the Sgr A complex near the Galactic center

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19515

 - **Abstract**
 Radio continuum and radio recombination line observations of the inner degree of the galactic center reveal a rich collection of thermal and nonthermal radio structures: (a) A network of linear filaments that are oriented perpendicular to the galactic plane constitute the major portion of the radio Arc at l~ 0.2°. These filaments have nonthermal characteristics, show polarized emission at 6, 3 and 2 cm, are organized over a 100 pc scale, and have a flat spectrum. (b) A number of thread-like filaments are situated asymmetrical with respect to the galactic plane and appear to be isolated unlike the linear filaments which are grouped together. The polarization and spectra of these so called "threads" are not yet known. (c) A network of arched filamentary structures that is disorganized in its appearance constitutes the curved portion of the Arc. Radio recombination line emission from these filaments indicates a thermal character for the emission. (d) A very steep-spectrum ridge of emission is seen to emerge from Sgr A. (e) The relative location of Sgr A East, West, a cluster of HII regions and the 50 km/s molecular cloud are discussed. Comparisons of the low and high-frequency maps show clearly that Sgr A East lies behind Sgr A West.

 - **Abstract**
 Young associations record complete histories of star forming events through their demographics and dynamics, and Gaia has greatly expanded our knowledge of these associations. We present the first structural and dynamical overview study of the Cep-Her Complex, which has recently emerged as the largest stellar population within 500 pc that still lacks substantial follow-up. We reveal that Cep-Her is not a singular association, but rather an amalgam of four, consisting of the older ($\tau > 100$ Myr) open cluster Roslund 6, in addition to three dynamically coherent and highly substructured young associations that we focus on: Orpheus (25-40 Myr), Cinyras (28-43 Myr), and Cupavo (54-80 Myr). With $9552 \pm 960$ stars in Orpheus, $3872 \pm 455$ stars in Cinyras, and $8794 \pm 1827$ stars in Cupavo, all three are among the largest young associations within 500 pc, rivalling major associations like Sco-Cen. Our novel view of the ages and dynamics of these associations reveals evidence for sequential star formation in Cinyras, in addition to a multi-origin pattern of stellar dispersal in Orpheus that may hint to the presence of multiple clouds at formation. Dynamical simulations indicate that while some embedded open clusters and central components of these associations are converging, they likely lack the mass necessary to capture one another and undergo hierarchical cluster assembly. Our results provide our first view of the complex star-forming environments that gave rise to the associations of Cep-Her, which will serve as important laboratories for future studies of star and planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars form in the densest regions of molecular clouds, however, there is no universal understanding of the factors that regulate cloud dynamics and their influence on the gas-to-stars conversion. This study considers the impact of Galactic shear on the rotation of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and its relation to the solenoidal modes of turbulence. We estimate the direction of rotation for a large sample of clouds in the \ce{^{13}CO}/\ce{C^{18}O} (3-2) Heterodyne Inner Milky Way Plane Survey (CHIMPS) and their corresponding sources in a new segmentation of the \ce{^{12}CO}(3-2) High-Resolution Survey (COHRS). To quantify the strength of shear, we introduce a parameter that describes the shear's ability to disrupt growing density perturbations within the cloud. Although we find no correlation between the direction of cloud rotation, the shear parameter, and the magnitude of the velocity gradient, the solenoidal fraction of the turbulence in the CHIMPS sample is positively correlated with the shear parameter and behaves similarly when plotted over Galactocentric distance. GMCs may thus not be large or long-lived enough to be affected by shear to the point of showing rotational alignment. In theory, Galactic shear can facilitate the rise of solenoidal turbulence and thus contribute to suppressing star formation. These results also suggest that the rotation of clouds is not strictly related to the overall rotation of the disc, but is more likely to be the imprint of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in the colliding flows that formed the clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: Ultraviolet (UV) lines of neutral carbon observed in absorption in the local diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) have long revealed that a substantial fraction of the mass of the gas lies at a thermal pressure one to three orders of magnitude above that of the bulk of the ISM. In this paper, we propose that this enigmatic component originates from shocks propagating at intermediate ($V_S > 30$ km s$^{-1}$) and high velocities ($V_S \geqslant 100$  km s$^{-1}$) in the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM). Methods: Shock waves irradiated by the standard interstellar radiation field (ISRF) are modelled using the Paris-Durham shock code designed to follow the dynamical, thermal, and chemical evolutions of shocks with velocities up to 500 km s$^{-1}$. Each observed line of sight is decomposed into a high pressure and a low pressure components. The column density of carbon at high pressure is confronted to the model predictions to derive the number of shocks along the line of sight and their total dissipation rate. Results: Phase transition shocks spontaneously lead to the presence of high pressure gas in the diffuse ISM and are found to naturally produce neutral carbon with excitation conditions and linewidths in remarkable agreement with the observations. The amounts of neutral carbon at high pressure detected over a sample of 89 lines of sight imply a dissipation rate of mechanical energy with a median of $\sim 3x10^{-25}$ erg cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ and a dispersion of about a factor of three. This distribution of the dissipation rate weakly depends on the detailed characteristics of shocks as long as they propagate at velocities between 30 and 200 kms s$^{-1}$ in a medium with a preshock density $n_H^0 \ge 0.3$ cm s$^{-3}$ and a transverse magnetic field $B_0 \leqslant 3$ $\mu$G. We not only show that this solution is consistent with a scenario of shocks driven by supernovae remnants (SNR) but also that this scenario is, in fact, unavoidable. Any line of sight in the observational sample is bound to intercept SNRs, mostly distributed in the spiral arms of the Milky Way, and expanding in the diffuse ionized and neutral phases of the Galaxy. Surprisingly, the range of dissipation rate derived here, in events that probably drive turbulence in the WNM, is found to be comparable to the distribution of the kinetic energy transfer rate of the turbulent cascade derived from the observations of CO in the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM). Conclusions: This work reveals a possible direct tracer of the mechanisms by which mechanical energy is injected in the ISM. It also suggests that a still unknown connection exists between the amount of energy dissipated during the injection process in the WNM and that used to feed interstellar turbulence and the turbulent cascade observed in the CNM.

 - **Abstract**
 In the early universe, strong large scale random flows prevail, and when these flows collide it produces sheets and filaments for the conventional particle dark matter model. However, for wave dark matter, the sheets and filaments are parallelly modulated by fine-scale and large-amplitude interference fringes. These long fine fringes tend to be unstable initially and subsequently deform and collapse to form halos of various sizes, perhaps down to proto-globular cluster scales. This work aims to investigate the instability of such fringes. Two colliding streams of quantum waves result in a standing density wave. By contrast, two colliding beams in classical collisionless fluid systems often give rise to beam instability, characterized by unstable oscillations with a complex frequency. Will the quantum standing density wave be subject to a similar instability? In fact, such unstable oscillations have never been observed in conventional quantum mechanical systems. This study discovers that periodic fringes can indeed undergo unstable oscillations or beam instability. The presence of any local density null in the background density that fails the Madelung formulation is shown to be the necessary condition for unstable oscillations. We establish a phase diagram to distinguish between beam instability, Jeans instability, and stable oscillation through theoretical calculations and computer simulations. Roughly speaking, Jeans instability almost always occurs for long-wave density perturbations; beam instability on the other hand always occurs when the density wave is aligned with the beam direction and moreover the period of the density wave is twice the period of background density; lastly, both instabilities diminish for a very low background density. We have engaged in Blocks theorem extensively in the analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 C$_4$H and $c$-C$_3$H$_2$, as unsaturated hydrocarbon molecules, are important for forming large organic molecules in the interstellar medium. We present mapping observations of C$_4$H ($N$=9$-8$) lines, $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ ($J_{Ka,Kb}$=2$_{1,2}$-1$_{0,1}$) %at 85338.894 MHz and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ ($J$=1$-0$) %at 86754.2884 MHz toward 19 nearby cold molecular cores in the Milky Way with the IRAM 30m telescope. C$_4$H 9--8 was detected in 13 sources, while $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ was detected in 18 sources. The widely existing C$_4$H and $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ molecules in cold cores provide material to form large organic molecules. Different spatial distributions between C$_4$H 9--8 and $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ 2--1 were found. The relative abundances of these three molecules were obtained under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions with a fixed excitation temperature. The abundance ratio of C$_4$H to $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ ranged from 0.34 $\pm$ 0.09 in G032.93+02 to 4.65 $\pm$ 0.50 in G008.67+22. A weak correlation between C$_4$H/H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and $c$-C$_3$H$_2$/H$^{13}$CO$^+$ abundance ratios was found, with a correlation coefficient of 0.46, which indicates that there is no tight astrochemical connection between C$_4$H and $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ molecules.

 - **Abstract**
 Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a class of intense celestial events that can be standardized for measuring cosmological parameters, bridging the gap between type Ia supernovae and the cosmic microwave background. In this work, we discuss the cosmological applications of SLSNe from the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST). Our estimation suggests that SLSNe rate is biased tracing the cosmic star formation rate, exhibiting a factor of $(1+z)^{1.2}$. We futher predict that CSST is poised to observe $\sim 360$ SLSNe in the 10 square degrees ultra-deep field survey within a span of 2.5 years. A stringent constraint on cosmological parameters can be derived from their peak-color relationship. CSST is anticipated to uncover a substantial number of SLSNe, contributing to a deeper understanding of their central engines and shedding light on the nature of dark energy at high redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Solar filament eruptions usually appear to occur in association with the sudden explosive release of magnetic energy accumulated in long-lived arched magnetic structures. It is the released energy that occasionally drives fast-filament eruptions that can be source regions of coronal mass ejections. Aim. The goal of this paper is to investigate the dynamic processes of a fast-filament eruption by using unprecedented high-resolution full-disk H$\alpha$ imaging spectroscopy observations. Methods. The whole process of the eruption was captured in a wide spectral window of the H$\alpha$ line ($\pm9.0$ A). Applying the "cloud model" and obtaining two dimensional optical thickness spectra we derive the Doppler velocity, the true eruption profiles (height, velocity, and acceleration), and the trajectory of the filament eruption in 3D space. Results. The Doppler velocity maps show that the filament was predominantly blue-shifted. During the main and final process of the eruption, strongly blue-shifted materials are manifested traveling with velocities exceeding $250~km/s$. The spectral analysis further revealed that the erupting filament is made of multiple components, some of which were Doppler-shifted approximately to $-300 ~km/s$. It is found that the filament eruption attains a maximum true velocity and acceleration of about $600~km/s$ and $2.5~km/s^2$, respectively, and its propagation direction deviates from the radial direction. On the other hand, downflows manifested as red-shifted plasma close to the footpoints of the erupting filament move with velocities $45-125~ km/s$. We interpret these red-shifted signatures as draining material, and therefore mass loss of the filament that has implications for the dynamic and the acceleration process of the eruption. Furthermore, we have estimated the total mass of the H$\alpha$ filament resulting in $\sim$$5.4\times10^{15}g$.
