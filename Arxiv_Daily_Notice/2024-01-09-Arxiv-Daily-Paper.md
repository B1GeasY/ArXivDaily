 - **Abstract**
 Henize 2-10 is a dwarf starburst galaxy hosting a $\sim10^{6}~M_{\odot}$ black hole (BH) that is driving an ionized outflow and triggering star formation within the central $\sim100$ pc of the galaxy. Here we present ALMA continuum observations from 99 to 340 GHz, as well as spectral line observations of the molecules CO (1-0, 3-2), HCN (1-0, 3-2), and HCO$^{+}$ (1-0, 3-2), with a focus on the BH and its vicinity. Incorporating cm-wave radio measurements from the literature, we show that the spectral energy distribution of the BH is dominated by synchrotron emission from 1.4 to~340 GHz with a spectral index of $\alpha\approx-0.5$. We analyze the spectral line data and identify an elongated molecular gas structure around the BH with a velocity distinct from the surrounding regions. The physical extent of this molecular gas structure is $\approx130~{\rm pc}\times30$ pc and the molecular gas mass is $\sim10^{6}~M_{\odot}$. Despite an abundance of molecular gas in this general region, the position of the BH is significantly offset from the peak intensity, which may explain why the BH is radiating at a very low Eddington ratio. Our analysis of the spatially-resolved line ratio between CO J=3-2 and J=1-0 implies that the CO gas in the vicinity of the BH is highly excited, particularly at the interface between the BH outflow and the regions of triggered star formation. This suggests that the cold molecular gas is being shocked by the bipolar outflow from the BH, supporting the case for positive BH feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent survey of the core-collapse supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (CasA) with the MIRI instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) revealed a large structure in the interior region, referred to as the "Green Monster". Although its location suggests that it is an ejecta structure, the infrared properties of the "Green Monster" hint at a circumstellar medium (CSM) origin. In this companion paper to the JWST Cas A paper, we investigate the filamentary X-ray structures associated with the "Green Monster" using Chandra X-ray Observatory data. We extracted spectra along the "Green Monster" as well as from shocked CSM regions. Both the extracted spectra and a principal component analysis show that the "Green Monster" emission properties are similar to those of the shocked CSM. The spectra are well-fit by a model consisting of a combination of a non-equilibrium ionization model and a power-law component, modified by Galactic absorption. All the "Green Monster" spectra show a blueshift of around ~2500 km/s, suggesting that the structure is on the near side of Cas A. The ionization age is around $n_{e}t$ = $1.4 \times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$s. This translates into a pre-shock density of ~11 cm$^{-3}$, higher than previous estimates of the unshocked CSM. The relatively high net and relatively low radial velocity suggest that this structure has a relatively high density compared to other shocked CSM plasma. This analysis provides yet another piece of evidence that the CSM around Cas A's progenitor was not that of a smooth steady wind profile.
#### Correlations and Distinguishability Challenges in Supernova Models:  Insights from Future Neutrino Detectors
 - **Authors:** Maria Manuela Saez, Ermal Rrapaj, Akira Harada, Shigehiro Nagataki, Yong-Zhong Qian

 - **Abstract**
 This paper explores core-collapse supernovae as crucial targets for neutrino telescopes, addressing uncertainties in their simulation results. We comprehensively analyze eighteen modern simulations and discriminate among supernova models using realistic detectors and interactions. A significant correlation between the total neutrino energy and cumulative counts, driven by massive lepton neutrinos and oscillations, is identified, particularly noticeable with the DUNE detector. Bayesian techniques indicate strong potential for model differentiation during a Galactic supernova event, with HK excelling in distinguishing models based on equation of state, progenitor mass, and mixing scheme.

 - **Abstract**
 It is currently unknown how matter behaves at the extreme densities found within the cores of neutron stars. Measurements of the neutron star equation of state probe nuclear physics that is otherwise inaccessible in a laboratory setting. Gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers encode details about this physics, allowing the equation of state to be inferred. Planned third-generation gravitational-wave observatories, having vastly improved sensitivity, are expected to provide tight constraints on the neutron star equation of state. We combine simulated observations of binary neutron star mergers by the third-generation observatories Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope to determine future constraints on the equation of state across a plausible neutron star mass range. In one year of operation, a network consisting of one Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope is expected to detect $\gtrsim 3\times 10^5$ binary neutron star mergers. By considering only the 75 loudest events, we show that such a network will be able to constrain the neutron star radius to at least $\lesssim 200$ m (90% credibility) in the mass range $1-1.97$ $M_{\odot}$ -- about ten times better than current constraints from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA and NICER. The constraint is $\lesssim 75$ m (90% credibility) near $1.4-1.6$ $M_{\odot}$ where we assume the the binary neutron star mass distribution is peaked. This constraint is driven primarily from the loudest $\sim 20$ events.
#### Stability of Hydrides in Sub-Neptune Exoplanets with Thick Hydrogen-Rich  Atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 Many sub-Neptune exoplanets have been believed to be composed of a thick hydrogen-dominated atmosphere and a high-temperature heavier-element-dominant core. From an assumption that there is no chemical reaction between hydrogen and silicates/metals at the atmosphere-interior boundary, the cores of sub-Neptunes have been modeled with molten silicates and metals (magma) in previous studies. In large sub-Neptunes, pressure at the atmosphere-magma boundary can reach tens of gigapascals where hydrogen is a dense liquid. A recent experiment showed that hydrogen can induce the reduction of Fe$^{2+}$ in (Mg,Fe)O to Fe$^0$ metal at the pressure-temperature conditions relevant to the atmosphere-interior boundary. However, it is unclear if Mg, one of the abundant heavy elements in the planetary interiors, remains oxidized or can be reduced by H. Our experiments in the laser-heated diamond-anvil cell found that heating of MgO + Fe to 3500-4900 K (close to or above their melting temperatures) in a H medium leads to the formation of Mg$_2$FeH$_6$ and H$_2$O at 8-13 GPa. At 26-29 GPa, the behavior of the system changes, and Mg-H in an H fluid and H$_2$O were detected with separate FeH$_x$. The observations indicate the dissociation of the Mg-O bond by H and subsequent production of hydride and water. Therefore, the atmosphere-magma interaction can lead to a fundamentally different mineralogy for sub-Neptune exoplanets compared with rocky planets. The change in the chemical reaction at the higher pressures can also affect the size demographics (i.e., "radius cliff") and the atmosphere chemistry of sub-Neptune exoplanets.
#### Period modulations of the long secondary periods on the AGB stars

 - **Abstract**
 30$\%$--50$\%$ of the luminous pulsating red-giant stars show light variations of a longer period than the pulsation periods. Those periods are called long secondary periods (LSP). There has been debated for many years but the origin of the LSP is still unknown. To explain the LSP variations, there have been many approaches in not only observations but also theoretical studies. However, the invariance of the length of the LSPs has been investigated little. Thus, we studied the temporal variations of the period by performing the weighted wavelet-Z-transform analysis. Using the OGLE-III database, the $I$-band light curves of 6904 and 1945 LSP candidates in the Large/Small Magellanic Clouds, respectively, were analyzed. Most of our sample stars indicated that the period corresponding to the LSP was constant during the observation term. However, 101 and 44 LSP stars in the LMC and SMC, respectively, showed the signature of the temporal variations of the LSPs. There were diversities of the period modulations i.e. monotonic increase or decrease, or constant until the middle and then increase, etc. The comet-like companion is one of the possible explanations for the LSP variations, but this hypothesis cannot explain the period modulations because the LSP is determined by the orbital period.
#### PeVatron Candidate SNR G106.3+2.7 in a Low-density Cavity: a  Multiwavelength Test
 - **Authors:** Yiwei Bao, Ruo-Yu Liu, Chong Ge, Yang Chen

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02654
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we constrain the density of the interstellar medium (ISM) around the hadronic PeVatron candidate, supernova remnant (SNR) G106.3+2.7, based on X-ray and $\gamma$-ray observations. The purpose of this investigation is to understand the influence of the gaseous environment on this SNR as a proton PeVatron candidate. By modelling the self-regulated propagation of the CRs injected from the SNR, we calculate the $\gamma$-ray emission of CRs via the hadronuclear interactions with the molecular cloud and the ISM, and use the measured $\gamma$-ray flux to constrain the ISM density around the SNR. Our results support the picture that the SNR is expanding into a low-density ($n<0.05 cm^{-3}$) cavity, enabling the SNR to be a potential proton PeVatron despite that it presently is not in the very early phase.
