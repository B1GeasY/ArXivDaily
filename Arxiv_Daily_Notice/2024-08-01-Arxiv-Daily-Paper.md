 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) Observational surveys of entire star-forming regions have provided evidence of power-law correlations between the disc properties and the stellar mass, especially the disc mass (${M_d \propto M_*}^{\lambda_m}$) and the accretion rate ($\dot M \propto {M_*}^{\lambda_{acc}}$). Whether the secular disc evolution affects said correlations is still debated: while the purely viscous scenario has been probed, other mechanisms could impact differently. We study the evolution of the slopes $\lambda_m$ and $\lambda_{acc}$ in the wind-driven and hybrid case and compare it to the viscous prediction, using a combination of analytical calculations and numerical simulations (performed with the 1D population synthesis code Diskpop, that we also present and release). Assuming $M_d(0) \propto {M_*}^{\lambda_{m, 0}}$ and $\dot M(0) \propto {M_*}^{\lambda_{acc, 0}}$ as initial conditions, we find that viscous and hybrid accretion preserve the shape of the correlations and evolve their slope; on the other hand, MHD winds change the shape of the correlations, bending them according to the scaling of the accretion timescale with the stellar mass. We also show how a spread in the initial conditions conceals this behaviour. We then analyse the impact of disc dispersal, and find that the currently available sample sizes ($\sim 30$ discs at 5 Myr) introduce stochastic oscillations in the slopes evolution, which dominate over the physical signatures. Increasing the sample size could mitigate this issue: $\sim 140$ discs at 5 Myr, corresponding to the complete Upper Sco sample, would give small enough error bars to use the evolution of the slopes as a proxy for the driving mechanism of disc evolution. Finally, we discuss how the observational claim of steepening slopes necessarily leads to an initially steeper $M_d - M_*$ correlation with respect to $\dot M - M_*$.
#### The MillenniumTNG Project: Impact of massive neutrinos on the cosmic large-scale structure and the distribution of galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss the cold dark matter plus massive neutrinos simulations of the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) project, which aim to improve understanding of how well ongoing and future large-scale galaxy surveys will measure neutrino masses. Our largest simulations, $3000\,{\rm Mpc}$ on a side, use $10240^3$ particles of mass $m_{p} = 6.66\times 10^{8}\,h^{-1}{\rm M}_\odot$ to represent cold dark matter, and $2560^3$ to represent a population of neutrinos with summed mass $M_\nu = 100\,{\rm meV}$. Smaller volume runs with $\sim 630\,{\rm Mpc}$ also include cases with $M_\nu = 0\,\textrm{and}\, 300\,{\rm meV}$. All simulations are carried out twice using the paired-and-fixed technique for cosmic variance reduction. We evolve the neutrino component using the particle-based $\delta f$ importance sampling method, which greatly reduces shot noise in the neutrino density field. In addition, we modify the GADGET-4 code to account both for the influence of relativistic and mildly relativistic components on the expansion rate and for non-Newtonian effects on the largest represented simulation scales. This allows us to quantify accurately the impact of neutrinos on basic statistical measures of nonlinear structure formation, such as the matter power spectrum and the halo mass function. We use semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to predict the galaxy population and its clustering properties as a function of summed neutrino mass, finding significant ($\sim 10\%$) impacts on the cosmic star formation rate history, the galaxy mass function, and the clustering strength. This offers the prospect of identifying combinations of summary statistics that are optimally sensitive to the neutrino mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations by pulsar timing arrays indicate the presence of gravitational wave signals, likely from supermassive black hole binaries. These binaries can produce two types of signals: a stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) or deterministic continuous gravitational waves (CGW). Correctly separating these signals is essential for accurate signal recovery and interpretation. This paper investigates the interaction between GWB and CGW signals within current analysis pipelines, focusing on misinterpretations and biases in parameter estimation when these signals are analyzed separately or together. We conducted several simulations based on the European PTA 24.8-year dataset. First, we injected either a GWB or a CGW. We compared parameter estimation using different search models, including Earth term only, combined Earth and pulsar term CGW templates, and correlated (HD) or uncorrelated (CURN) power law GWB templates. Our findings show that, when searched independently, the GWB and CGW signals can be misinterpreted as each other, and only a combined search can recover the true signal present. For datasets containing both a GWB and a CGW, failure to account for the CGW biases the recovery of the GWB. However, a combined search allows for the recovery of both GWB and CGW parameters without significant bias. Care must be taken with the method used to perform combined searches on these multi-component datasets, as the CGW pulsar term can be misinterpreted as a CURN. This can be avoided by direct searches for an HD correlated GWB plus a CGW. Our study underscores the importance of combined searches to ensure unbiased recovery of GWB parameters in the presence of strong CGWs, which is crucial for interpreting signals recently found in PTA data and represents a step toward a robust framework for disentangling stochastic and deterministic GW signals in future, more sensitive datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 With dayside temperatures hot enough to sustain a magma ocean and a silicate atmosphere, lava planets are the best targets to study the atmosphere of a rocky world. In the absence of nightside heating, the entire atmosphere collapses near the day-night terminator, so condensation seems inevitable, but the impact of clouds on radiative transfer, dynamics, and observables has not yet been studied in the non-global atmospheric regime. Therefore, we simulate cloud formation and determine which lava planets should be most affected by clouds. We find that despite the scattering of visible light by clouds, heat advection compensates for the cooling effect of clouds in the atmosphere. On the other hand, surface temperatures are significantly affected and can drop 100-200 K under a cloudy sky. We find that among our targets, HD213885b and HD20329b are most affected by cloud formation: there is a discernable difference between having clouds and not having them, but the precision required to make such an inference is at the limit of current instruments.

 - **Abstract**
 The SSPACE Astrobiology Payload (SAP) series, starting with the SAP-1 project is designed to conduct in-situ microbiology experiments in low earth orbit. This payload series aims to understand the behaviour of microbial organisms in space, particularly those critical for human health, and the corresponding effects due to microgravity and solar/galactic radiation. SAP-1 focuses on studying Bacillus clausii and Bacillus coagulans, bacteria beneficial to humans. It aims to provide a space laboratory for astrobiology experiments under microgravity conditions. The hardware developed for these experiments is indigenous and tailored to meet the unique requirements of autonomous microbiology experiments by controlling pressure, temperature, and nutrition flow to bacteria. A rotating platform, which forms the core design, is innovatively utilised to regulate the flow and mixing of nutrients with dormant bacteria. The technology demonstration models developed at SSPACE have yielded promising results, with ongoing efforts to refine, adapt for space conditions, and prepare for integration with nanosatellites or space modules. The anticipated payload will be compact, approximately 1U in size (10cm x 10cm x 10cm), consume less than 5W power, and offer flexibility for various microbiological studies.
#### Einstein Probe discovery of a super-soft outburst from CXOU J005245.0-722844: a rare BeWD binary in the Small Magellanic Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 On May 27 2024, the Wide-field X-ray Telescope onboard the Einstein Probe (EP) mission detected enhanced X-ray emission from a new transient source in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) during its commissioning phase. Prompt follow-up with the EP Follow-up X-ray Telescope, the Swift X-ray Telescope and Nicer have revealed a very soft, thermally emitting source (kT$\sim$0.1 keV at the outburst peak) with an X-ray luminosity of L$\sim$4$\times$10$^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$, coincident with CXOU J005245.0-722844. This super-soft outburst faded very quickly in a week time. Several emission lines and absorption edges were present in the X-ray spectrum, such as the Oxygen (0.57 keV) and Neon (0.92 keV) He-like emission lines, and deep Nitrogen (0.67 keV) and Oxygen (0.87 keV) absorption edges. The X-ray emission resembles typical nova outbursts from an accreting white dwarf (WD) in a binary system, despite the X-ray source being historically associated with an O9-B0e massive star exhibiting a 17.55 days periodicity in the optical band. The discovery of this super-soft outburst nails down CXOU J005245.0-722844 as a BeWD X-ray binary: an elusive evolutionary stage where two main-sequence massive stars have undergone a common envelope phase and experienced at least two episodes of mass transfer. In addition, the very short duration of the outburst and the presence of Ne features hint at a rather massive, i.e., close to the Chandrasekhar limit, Ne-O WD in the system.
#### Why Do Stars Turn Red?

 - **Abstract**
 When a star exhausts the hydrogen fuel in its core, the core contracts, and the envelope may expand to $\sim 100$ times its original size. Consequently, stars with $\lesssim 8$ solar masses become red giants, while those with $\gtrsim 8$ solar masses evolve into red supergiants. However, the physics driving this extreme expansion is unclear. This letter presents a new mechanism grounded in the instability of stellar envelopes to explain the expansion. If the gravitational energy released by core contraction can trigger the initial expansion to a critical radius where the envelope becomes unstable, the star then continues expanding until stabilizing, thereby becoming a red giant or supergiant. We demonstrate that the envelope instability can explain several elusive features in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, such as the Hertzsprung gap between the main sequence and the red giant branch, as well as the dichotomy of the supergiant populations in red and blue.

 - **Abstract**
 Characterizing the chemistry of complex organic molecules (COMs) at the epoch of planet formation provides insights into the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM) and the origin of organic materials in our Solar System. We report a detection of dimethyl ether (CH$_3$OCH$_3$) in the disk around the Herbig Ae star MWC 480 with the sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations. This is the first detection of CH$_3$OCH$_3$ in a non-transitional Class II disk. The spatially unresolved, compact (${\lesssim}$25 au in radius) nature, the broad line width ($\sim$30 km s$^{-1}$), and the high excitation temperature (${\sim}$200 K) indicate sublimation of COMs in the warm inner disk. Despite the detection of CH$_3$OCH$_3$, methanol (CH$_3$OH), the most abundant COM in the ISM, has not been detected, from which we constrain the column density ratio of CH$_3$OCH$_3$/CH$_3$OH ${\gtrsim}$7. This high ratio may indicate the reprocessing of COMs during the disk phase, as well as the effect of the physical structure in the inner disk. We also find that this ratio is higher than in COM-rich transition disks recently discovered. This may indicate that, in the full disk of MWC 480, COMs have experienced substantial chemical reprocessing in the innermost region, while the COM emission in the transition disks predominantly traces the inherited ice sublimating at the dust cavity edge located at larger radii (${\gtrsim}$20 au).

 - **Abstract**
 The identification of complex prebiotic molecules using millimeter and submillimeter telescopes allows us to understand how the basic building blocks of life are formed in the universe. In the interstellar medium (ISM), ethylene glycol ((CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$) is the simplest sugar alcohol molecule, and it is the reduced alcohol of the simplest sugar-like molecule, glycolaldehyde (CH$_{2}$OHCHO). We present the first detection of the rotational emission lines of $aGg^{\prime}$ conformer of ethylene glycol ((CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$) towards the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). The estimated column density of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ towards the G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 is (4.5$\pm$0.1)$\times$10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ with an excitation temperature of 155$\pm$35 K. The abundance of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ with respect to H$_{2}$ is (1.4$\pm$0.5)$\times$10$^{-8}$. Similarly, the abundances of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ with respect to CH$_{2}$OHCHO and CH$_{3}$OH are 3.1$\pm$0.5 and (6.1$\pm$0.3)$\times$10$^{-3}$. We compare the estimated abundance of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ with the existing three-phase warm-up chemical model abundance of (CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$, and we notice the observed abundance and modelled abundance are nearly similar. We discuss the possible formation pathways of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ towards the hot molecular cores, and we find that $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ is probably created via the recombination of two CH$_{2}$OH radicals on the grain surface of G358.93$-$0.03 MM1.
#### Cloud Collision Signatures in the Central Molecular Zone

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular cloud collisions are a prominent theory for the formation of stars. Observational studies into cloud collisions identify the collision via a bridging feature: a continuous strip of line emission that connects two intensity peaks that are related in position space and separated in velocity space. Currently, most observations of collisions and these bridging features take place in the Milky Way disc. They are also theorized to take place in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), where temperatures and densities are both significantly higher than in the disc. For studies in the Milky Way Disc, the most commonly-used tracer tends to be CO. However, for studies in the CMZ, where the density and temperature are significantly higher, CO becomes so abundant that it loses its ability to adequately highlight the bridging feature of cloud collisions. As a result, studies have begun using other tracers, whose physical and chemical behavior has not been studied under CMZ conditions. We perform combined hydrodynamical, chemical and radiative transfer simulations of cloud collisions under both disc- and CMZ-like conditions, and investigate collision signatures in a number of commonly-observed molecular lines. Under the Milky Way disc conditions \( \co \) has the standard bridging feature; however, the other tracers, CS, HCO$^{+}$, N$_2$H$^{+}$ only emit in the intermediate-velocity bridge region, making the feature itself non-existent. In the CMZ, the higher density and temperature make the bridging feature far more indistinct for CO, but the other tracers have morphologically similar bridging features to the CO disc model, validating their use as tracers of cloud collisions under these conditions.
#### The frequency of transiting planetary systems around polluted white dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the frequency of transiting planetary systems around metal-polluted white dwarfs using high-cadence photometry from ULTRACAM and ULTRASPEC on the ground, and space-based observations with TESS. Within a sample of 313 metal-polluted white dwarfs with available TESS light curves, two systems known to have irregular transits are blindly recovered by box-least-squares and Lomb-Scargle analyses, with no new detections, yielding a transit fraction of 0.8 (-0.4, +0.6) per cent. Planet detection sensitivities are determined using simulated transit injection and recovery for all light curves, producing upper limit occurrences over radii from dwarf to Kronian planets, with periods from 1 h to 27 d. The dearth of short-period, transiting planets orbiting polluted white dwarfs is consistent with engulfment during the giant phases of stellar evolution, and modestly constrains dynamical re-injection of planets to the shortest orbital periods. Based on simple predictions of transit probability, where (R + Rp)/a ~ 0.01, the findings here are nominally consistent with a model where 100 per cent of polluted white dwarfs have circumstellar debris near the Roche limit; however, the small sample size precludes statistical confidence in this result. Single transits are also ruled out in all light curves using a search for correlated outliers, providing weak constraints on the role of Oort-like comet clouds in white dwarf pollution.
