#### Earths are not Super-Earths, Saturns are not Jupiters: Imprints of  pressure-bump planet formation on planetary architectures

 - **Abstract**
 In protoplanetary disks, sufficiently massive planets excite pressure bumps, which can then be preferred locations for forming new planet cores. We discuss how this loop may affect the architecture of multi-planet systems, and compare our predictions with observation. Our main prediction is that low-mass planets and giant planets can each be divided into two subpopulations with different levels of mass uniformity. Low-mass planets that can and cannot reach the pebble isolation mass (the minimum mass required to produce a pressure bump) develop into intra-similar "Super-Earths" and more diverse "Earths", respectively. Gas giants that do and do not accrete envelope quickly develop into intra-similar "Jupiters" and more diverse "Saturns", respectively. Super-Earths prefer to form long chains via repeated pressure-bump planet formation, while Jupiter formation is usually terminated at pairs or triplets due to dynamical instability. These predictions are broadly consistent with observations. In particular, we discover a previously overlooked mass uniformity dichotomy among the observed populations of both low-mass planets (Earths vs. Super-Earths) and gas giants (Saturns vs. Jupiters). For low-mass planets, planets well below the pebble isolation mass ($\lesssim 3M_\oplus$ or $\lesssim 1.5 R_\oplus$ for sun-like stars) show significantly higher intra-system pairwise mass difference than planets around the pebble isolation mass. For gas giants, the period ratios of intra-system pairs show a bimodal distribution, which can be interpreted as two subpopulations with different levels of mass uniformity. These findings suggest that pressure-bump planet formation could be an important ingredient in shaping planetary architectures.

 - **Abstract**
 AMS-02 on board the ISS provides precise measurements of Cosmic Rays (CR) near Earth, while Voyager measures CR in the local interstellar medium, beyond the effects of solar modulation. Based on these data, we test and revise various CR propagation scenarios under standard assumptions: pure diffusion, diffusion with convection, diffusion with reacceleration, and diffusion with reacceleration and convection. We report on the scenarios' performance against CR measurements, aiming to limit the number of model parameters as much as possible. For each scenario we find parameters that are able to reproduce Voyager and AMS-02 data for the entire energy band for all the CR species tested. Above several GV we observe a similar injection spectral index for He and C, with He harder than H. Some scenarios previously disfavored are now reconsidered. For example, contrary to usual assumptions, we find that the pure diffusion scenario does not need an upturn in the diffusion coefficient at low energy, while it needs the same number of low-energy breaks in the injection spectrum as diffusive-reacceleration scenarios. We show that scenarios differ in modeled spectra of one order of magnitude for positrons at around 1 GeV and of a factor of 2 for antiprotons at several GV. The force-field approximation describes well the AMS-02 and Voyager spectra analyzed, except antiprotons. We confirm the excess around 10 GeV in the antiproton spectrum for all scenarios. Also, for all scenarios, the resulting solar modulation should be stronger for positrons than for nuclei, with reacceleration models requiring much larger modulation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present emission maps (1.5'$\times$1.5' scale, corresponding to 0.18 pc) of the DCN ($J=2-1$) and DCO$^+$ ($J=2-1$) lines in the 2 mm band toward the Orion KL region obtained with the 2 mm receiver system named B4R installed on the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT). The DCN emission shows a peak at the Orion KL hot core position, whereas no DCO$^+$ emission has been detected there. The DCO$^+$ emission shows enhancement at the west side of the hot core, which is well shielded from the UV radiation from OB massive stars in the Trapezium cluster. We have derived the abundance ratio of DCN/DCO$^+$ at three representative positions where both species have been detected. The gas components with $V_{\rm {LSR}} \approx 7.5-8.7$ km/s are associated with low abundance ratios of $\sim4-6$, whereas much higher abundance ratios ($\sim22-30$) are derived for the gas components with $V_{\rm {LSR}} \approx 9.2-11.6$ km/s. We have compared the observed abundance ratio to our chemical models and found that the observed differences in the DCN/DCO$^+$ abundance ratios are explained by different densities.
#### Condensate evolution in the solar nebula inferred from combined Cr, Ti,  and O isotope analyses of amoeboid olivine aggregates

 - **Abstract**
 Refractory inclusions in chondritic meteorites, namely amoeboid olivine aggregates (AOAs) and Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs), are among the first solids to have formed in the solar system. The isotopic composition of CAIs is distinct from bulk meteorites, which either results from extreme processing of presolar carriers in the CAI-forming region, or reflects an inherited heterogeneity from the Sun's parental molecular cloud. Amoeboid olivine aggregates are less refractory than CAIs and provide a record of how the isotopic composition of solid material in the disk may have changed in time and space. However, the isotopic composition of AOAs and how this composition relates to that of CAIs and later-formed solids is unknown. Here, using new O, Ti, and Cr isotopic data for eight AOAs from the Allende CV3 chondrite, we show that CAIs and AOAs share a common isotopic composition, indicating a close genetic link and formation from the same isotopic reservoir. Because AOAs are less refractory than CAIs, this observation is difficult to reconcile with a thermal processing origin of the isotope anomalies. Instead, the common isotopic composition of CAIs and AOAs is readily accounted for in a model in which the isotopic composition of infalling material from the Sun's parental molecular cloud changed over time. In this model, CAIs and AOAs record the isotopic composition of the early infall, while later-formed solids contain a larger fraction of the later, isotopically distinct infall. This model implies that CAIs and AOAs record the isotopic composition of the Sun and suggests that the nucleosynthetic isotope heterogeneity of the solar system is predominantly produced by mixing of solar nebula condensates, which acquired their distinct isotopic compositions as a result of time-varied infall from the protosolar cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 1 (EUSO-SPB1) was launched in 2017 April from Wanaka, New Zealand. The plan of this mission of opportunity on a NASA super pressure balloon test flight was to circle the southern hemisphere. The primary scientific goal was to make the first observations of ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray extensive air showers (EASs) by looking down on the atmosphere with an ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence telescope from suborbital altitude (33~km). After 12~days and 4~hours aloft, the flight was terminated prematurely in the Pacific Ocean. Before the flight, the instrument was tested extensively in the West Desert of Utah, USA, with UV point sources and lasers. The test results indicated that the instrument had sensitivity to EASs of approximately 3 EeV. Simulations of the telescope system, telescope on time, and realized flight trajectory predicted an observation of about 1 event assuming clear sky conditions. The effects of high clouds were estimated to reduce this value by approximately a factor of 2. A manual search and a machine-learning-based search did not find any EAS signals in these data. Here we review the EUSO-SPB1 instrument and flight and the EAS search.

 - **Abstract**
 The dominant mechanism forming multiple stellar systems in the high-mass regime (M$_\ast \gtrsim $ 8 $M_{\odot}$) remained unknown because direct imaging of multiple protostellar systems at early phases of high-mass star formation is very challenging. High-mass stars are expected to form in clustered environments containing binaries and higher-order multiplicity systems. So far only a few high-mass protobinary systems, and no definitive higher-order multiples, have been detected. Here we report the discovery of one quintuple, one quadruple, one triple and four binary protostellar systems simultaneously forming in a single high-mass protocluster, G333.23--0.06, using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array high-resolution observations. We present a new example of a group of gravitationally bound binary and higher-order multiples during their early formation phases in a protocluster. This provides the clearest direct measurement of the initial configuration of primordial high-order multiple systems, with implications for the in situ multiplicity and its origin. We find that the binary and higher-order multiple systems, and their parent cores, show no obvious sign of disk-like kinematic structure. We conclude that the observed fragmentation into binary and higher-order multiple systems can be explained by core fragmentation, indicating its crucial role in establishing the multiplicity during high-mass star cluster formation.

 - **Abstract**
 While small, Neptune-like planets are among the most abundant exoplanets, our understanding of their atmospheric structure and dynamics remains sparse. In particular, many unknowns remain on the way moist convection works in these atmospheres where condensable species are heavier than the non-condensable background gas. While it has been predicted that moist convection could shut-down above some threshold abundance of these condensable species, this prediction is based on simple linear analysis and relies on strong assumptions on the saturation of the atmosphere. To investigate this issue, we develop a 3D cloud resolving model for H2 atmospheres with large amounts of condensable species and apply this model to a prototypical temperate Neptune-like planet -- K2-18b. Our model confirms the shut-down of moist convection and the onset of a stably stratified layer in the atmosphere, leading to much hotter deep atmospheres and interiors. Our 3D simulations further provide quantitative estimates of the turbulent mixing in this stable layer, which is a key driver of the cycling of condensables in the atmosphere. This allows us to build a very simple, yet realistic 1D model that captures the most salient features of the structure of Neptune-like atmospheres. Our qualitative findings on the behavior of moist convection in hydrogen atmospheres go beyond temperate planets and should also apply to the regions where iron and silicates condense in the deep interior of H2-dominated planets. Finally, we use our model to investigate the likelihood of a liquid ocean beneath a H2 dominated atmosphere on K2-18b. We find that the planet would need to have a very high albedo (>0.5-0.6) to sustain a liquid ocean. However, due to the spectral type of the star, the amount of aerosol scattering that would be needed to provide such a high albedo is inconsistent with the latest observational data.
#### Near-Ultraviolet Radiation toward Molecular Cloud N4 in W 50/SS 433:  Evidence for Direct Interaction of the Jet with Molecular Cloud

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06645
 - **Abstract**
 We compared the molecular clouds in the western part of SS 433 with near-ultraviolet radiation data obtained from GALEX. Near-ultraviolet radiation is prominently confirmed toward only N4, while no near-ultraviolet radiation is detected toward N1, N2, and N3. The radiative region of near-ultraviolet radiation is nearly the same as the CO-emitting region in N4, and does not extend beyond the jet seen in X-ray radiation. Near-ultraviolet radiation cannot be explained solely by broadband continuous radiation and may originate from line emissions. The intensity of near-ultraviolet radiation exhibits an anti-correlation with that of 13CO(J=3-2) emission. This anti-correlation, along with strong far-infrared radiation in the region with weaker near-ultraviolet radiation intensity compared to its surroundings, suggests that near-ultraviolet radiation originates from behind the molecular cloud, heating up the interstellar dust in N4. Subsequently, the dust in N4 re-radiates in the far-infrared band. In the same region, a high peak T_MB ratio of 12CO(J=3-2)/12CO(J=1-0) of ~0.9, and a high kinetic temperature of T_k ~56 K in the molecular cloud indicate that CO molecules are highly excited, and the molecular cloud is heated through photoelectric heating. This heating results from electrons released due to the photoelectric effect caused by the phenomenon where interstellar dust absorbs near-ultraviolet radiation. In terms of the timescale of near-ultraviolet radiation originating from line emissions, near-ultraviolet radiation towards N4 cannot be explained by the shock of the blast wave from a supernova that created W 50. These findings also suggest that N4 directly interacts with the jet from SS 433. As a result of this direct interaction, near-ultraviolet radiation is emitted from an interacting layer between the jet and N4.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct one-dimensional stellar-evolution simulations of stars with zero age main sequence masses of $M_{ZAMS} = 8.8-9.45 M_\odot$ towards core collapse by electron capture, and find that the convective zone of the pre-collapse core can supply the required stochastic angular momentum fluctuations to set a jet-driven electron capture supernova (ECSN) explosion in the frame of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). By our criteria of minimum convective specific angular momentum and an accreted mass during jet-launching of $M_{acc} \simeq 0.001-0.01 M_\odot$, the layer in the convective zone that when accreted launches the exploding jittering jets resides in the helium-rich zone. This exploding layer is accreted at about a minute to a few hours, depending on the model, after core collapse occurs, much shorter than the time the exploding shock crosses the star. The final (gravitational) mass of the neutron star (NS) remnant is in the range of $M_{NS} =1.25-1.43 M_\odot$. Our results add to the growing support of the JJEM as the main explosion mechanism of massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The excitation mechanism of coronal quasi-period fast-propagating (QFP) wave trains remains unresolved. Using Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory observations, we study a narrow and a broad QFP wave train excited one after another during the successive eruptions of filaments hosted within a fan-spine magnetic system on 2013 October 20. The consecutive occurrence of these two types of QFP wave trains in the same event provides an excellent opportunity to explore their excitation mechanisms and compare their physical parameters. Our observational results reveal that narrow and broad QFP wave trains exhibit distinct speeds, periods, energy fluxes, and relative intensity amplitudes, although originating from the same active region and being associated with the same {\em GOES} C2.9 flare. Using wavelet analysis, we find that the narrow QFP wave train shares a similar period with the flare itself, suggesting its possible excitation through the pulsed energy release in the magnetic reconnection process that generated the accompanying flare. On the other hand, the broad QFP wave train appears to be associated with the energy pulses released by the successive expansion and unwinding of filament threads. Additionally, it is plausible that the broad QFP wave train was also excited by the sequential stretching of closed magnetic field lines driven by the erupting filament. These findings shed light on the different excitation mechanisms and origins of the QFP wave trains.
#### Core shift in parabolic accelerating jets

 - **Abstract**
 The core shift method is a powerful method to estimate the physical parameters in relativistic jets from active galactic nuclei. The classical approach assumes a conical geometry of a jet and a constant plasma speed. However, recent observations showed that neither may hold close to the central engine, where plasma in a jet is effectively accelerating, and the jet geometry is quasi-parabolic. We modify the classical core shift method to account for these jet properties. We show that the core shift index may assume values in the range 0.8-1.2 or 0.53-0.8 depending on the jet geometry and viewing angle, with the indices close to both values are indeed being observed. We obtain the expressions to estimate jet magnetic field and a total magnetic flux in a jet. We show that the obtained magnetic field value can be easily recalculated down to the gravitational radius scales. For M 87 and NGC 315 these values are in good agreement with the ones obtained by different methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Pre-main sequence disk accretion is pivotal in determining the final stellar properties and the early conditions for close-in planets. We aim to establish the impact of internal (stellar mass) and external (radiation field) parameters on disk evolution in the Lagoon Nebula massive star-forming region. We employ simultaneous $u,g,r,i,H\alpha$ time series photometry, archival infrared data, and high-precision $K2$ light curves, to derive stellar, disk, and accretion properties for 1012 Lagoon Nebula members. Of all young stars in the Lagoon Nebula, we estimate $34\%-37\%$ have inner disks traceable down to $\sim 12$ $\mu$m, while $38\%-41\%$ are actively accreting. We detect disks $\sim$1.5 times more frequently around G/K/M stars than higher-mass stars, which appear to deplete their inner disks on shorter timescales. We find tentative evidence for faster disk evolution in the central regions of the Lagoon Nebula, where the bulk of the O/B population is located. Conversely, disks appear to last longer at its outskirts, where the measured fraction of disk-bearing stars tends to exceed those of accreting and disk-free stars. The derived mass accretion rates show a non-uniform dependence on stellar mass between $\sim 0.2-5$ $M_\odot$. In addition, the typical accretion rates appear to differ across the Lagoon Nebula extension, with values two times lower in the core region than at its periphery. Finally, we detect tentative density gradients in the accretion shocks, with lags in the appearance of brightness features as a function of wavelength that can amount to $\sim7\%-30\%$ of the rotation period.
