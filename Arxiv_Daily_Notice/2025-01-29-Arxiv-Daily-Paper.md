 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of new 7.7-11.3 $\mu$m data obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope Mid-InfraRed Instrument in the starburst galaxy M 82. In particular, we focus on the dependency of the integrated CO(1-0) line intensity on the MIRI-F770W and MIRI-F1130W filter intensities to investigate the correlation between CO content and the 7.7 and 11.3 $\mu$m features from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in M 82's outflows. To perform our analysis, we identify CO clouds using archival $^{12}$CO($J$=1-0) NOEMA moment 0 map within 2 kpc from the center of M 82, with sizes ranging between $\sim$21 and 270 pc; then, we compute the CO-to-PAH relations for the 306 validated CO clouds. On average, the power-law slopes for the two relations in M 82 are lower than what is seen in local main-sequence spirals. In addition, there is a moderate correlation between $I_{\rm CO(1-0)}$-$I_{\rm 7.7\mu m} /I_{\rm 11.3\mu m}$ for most of the CO cloud groups analyzed in this this http URL results suggest that the extreme conditions in M 82 translate into CO not tracing the full budget of molecular gas in smaller clouds, perhaps as a consequence of photoionization and/or emission suppression of CO molecules due to hard radiation fields from the central starburst.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper rigorously examines the potential of the $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ theory as a promising framework for understanding the dark sector of the universe, particularly in relation to cosmic acceleration. The $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ theory extends gravitational dynamics by incorporating both the torsion scalar $T$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $\mathcal{T}$. Further, we explore the functional form $f(T, \mathcal{T}) = T + \beta \mathcal{T}$, where $\beta$ is a free parameter that modulates the matter's influence on spacetime evolution. To evaluate this model, we employ an effective EoS parameter dependent on redshift $z$, to solve the field equations and analyze the evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. Using a joint dataset ($H(z)+Pantheon^+$) and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with Bayesian analysis, we obtain the best-fit parameter values: $H_0 = 68.04 \pm 0.64$, $\beta = 0.14 \pm 0.17$, and $\gamma = 0.96^{+0.38}_{-0.69}$, which align well with current observational data. Our findings indicate a deceleration parameter of $q_0 = -0.51$, supporting a present-day accelerated expansion phase, with a transition redshift $z_t = 0.57$ marking the universe's shift from deceleration to acceleration. Moreover, we confirm a positive cosmic fluid energy density, reinforcing stability, and find an EoS parameter value of $\omega_0 = -0.76$, consistent with quintessence-driven acceleration. These results underscore the viability of $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ as a robust framework for addressing the accelerating universe and dark energy dynamics, paving the way for future investigations into its cosmological implications.

 - **Abstract**
 A heliospheric termination shock (HTS) surrounds our solar system at approximately 100 astronomical units from the Sun, where the expanding solar wind (SW) is compressed and heated before encountering the interstellar medium. HTS-accelerated particles govern the pressure balance with the interstellar medium, but little is known about the HTS's global properties beyond in situ measurements from Voyager in only two directions of the sky. We fill this gap in knowledge with a novel and complex methodology: particle-in-cell, test particle, and MHD simulations, combined with a global minimization scheme to derive global HTS compression ratio sky maps. The methods utilize Interstellar Boundary Explorer observations of energetic neutral atoms produced from HTS-accelerated particles. Our results reveal unique, three-dimensional characteristics, such as higher compression near the poles during solar minimum, north-south asymmetries from the disparate polar coronal holes' evolution, and minimum compression near the flanks likely from SW slowing by mass-loading over a greater distance to the HTS.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform three-dimensional supernova simulations with a phenomenological treatment of neutrino flavor conversions. We show that the explosion energy can increase to as high as ~10^51 erg depending on the critical density for the onset of flavor conversions, due to a significant enhancement of the mean energy of electron antineutrinos. Our results confirm previous studies showing such energetic explosions, but for the first time in three-dimensional configurations. In addition, we predict neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from a nearby supernova explosion aided by flavor conversions. We find that the neutrino event number decreases because of the reduced flux of heavy-lepton neutrinos. In order to detect GWs, next-generation GW telescopes such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope are needed even if the supernova event is located at the Galactic center. These findings show that the neutrino flavor conversions can significantly change supernova dynamics and highlight the importance of further studies on the quantum kinetic equations to determine the conditions of the conversions and their asymptotic states.

 - **Abstract**
 Dust growth is often indirectly inferred observationally in star-forming environments, theoretically predicted to produce mm-sized particles in circumstellar discs, and also presumably witnessed by the predecessors of the terrestrial meteoritic record. For those reasons it is believed that young gas giants under formation in protoplanetary discs with putative circumplanetary discs (CPDs) surrounding them, such as PDS 70c, should be containing mm-sized particles. We model the spectra of a set of CPDs, which we obtained from radiation hydrodynamic simulations at varying Rosseland opacities kappa_R. The kappa_R from the hydrodynamic simulations are matched with consistent opacity sets of ISM-like composition, but grown to larger sizes. Our high kappa_R hydro data nominally corresponds to 10 mum-sized particles, and our low kappa_R-cases correspond to mm-sized particles. We investigate the resulting broad spectral features at first while keeping the overall optical depth in the planetary envelope constant. Dust growth to size distributions dominated by millimeter particles generally results in broad, featureless spectra with black-body like slopes in the far-infrared, while size distributions dominated by small dust develop steeper slopes in the far-infrared and maintain some features stemming from individual minerals. We find that significant dust growth from microns to millimeters can explain the broad features of the PDS 70c data, when upscaling the dust masses from our simulations by x100. Furthermore our results indicate that the spectral range of 30-500 mum is an ideal hunting ground for broadband features arising from the CPD, but that longer wavelengths observed with ALMA can also be used for massive circumplanetary discs

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as one of the most dynamic areas of research in astronomy and cosmology. Despite increasing number of FRBs have been reported, the exact origin of FRBs remains elusive. Investigating the intrinsic distributions of FRBs could provide valuable insights into their possible origins and enhance the power of FRBs a cosmological probe. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian inference approach combining with several viable models to investigate the population information of FRBs released in the CHIME catalog 1. By utilizing this method, we aim to uncover the underlying patterns and characteristics of the FRB population. Taking into account the uncertainties and complex relationships within the data. We find that the distribution of FRBs does not trace the history of star formation, and there is evidence that the FRB population has time delay with respect to the history of star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a search for strong gravitational lenses in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 6 imaging data. We implement a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) for our machine learning (ML) architecture and adopt Interactive Machine Learning to construct a training sample with multiple classes to address common types of false positives. Our ML model reduces 236 million DES cutout images to 22,564 targets of interest, including around 85% of previously reported galaxy-galaxy lens candidates discovered in DES. These targets were visually inspected by citizen scientists, who ruled out approximately 90% as false positives. Of the remaining 2,618 candidates, 149 were expert-classified as 'definite' lenses and 516 as 'probable' lenses, with 147 of these candidates being newly identified. Additionally, we trained a second ViT to find double-source plane lens systems, finding at least one double-source system. Our main ViT excels at identifying galaxy-galaxy lenses, consistently assigning high scores to candidates with high confidence. The top 800 ViT-scored images include around 100 of our `definite' lens candidates. This selection is an order of magnitude higher in purity than previous convolutional neural network-based lens searches and demonstrates the feasibility of applying our methodology for discovering large samples of lenses in future surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The size of a protoplanetary disk is a fundamental property, yet most remain unresolved, even in nearby star-forming regions (d $\sim$ 140-200 pc). We present the complete continuum size distribution for the $105$ brightest protoplanetary disks (M$_{\text{dust}}$ $\gtrsim$ 2 M$_{\oplus}$) in the Ophiuchus cloud, obtained from ALMA Band 8 (410 GHz) observations at 0.05$^{\prime\prime}$ (7 au) to 0.15$^{\prime\prime}$ (21 au) resolution. This sample includes 54 Class II and 51 Class I and Flat Spectrum sources, providing a comprehensive distribution across evolutionary stages. We measure the Half Width at Half Maximum (HWHM) and the radius encircling $68\%$ of the flux ($R_{68\%}$) for most non-binary disks, yielding the largest flux-limited sample of resolved disks in any star-forming region. The distribution is log-normal with a median value of $\sim$14 au and a logarithmic standard deviation $\sigma_{\log} = 0.46$ (factor of 2.9 in linear scale). Disks in close binary systems ($<$ 200 au separation) have smaller radii, with median value of $\sim$5 au, indicating efficient radial drift as predicted by dust evolution models. The size distribution for young embedded objects (SED Class I and Flat Spectrum, age $\lesssim$ 1 Myr) is similar to that of Class II objects (age $\sim$ a few Myr), implying that pressure bumps must be common at early disk stages to prevent mm-sized particle migration at au scales.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of acetylene (C$_2$H$_2$) and its isotopologues in the Orion IRc2 region, focusing on the determination of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratios using high-resolution infrared spectra from SOFIA. By employing a robust $\chi^2$ fitting method, we simultaneously determined temperature and column density, achieving a $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of $18.72^{+1.54}_{-1.46}$ for the blue clump and $15.07^{+1.61}_{-1.60}$ for the red clump. These results revealed significant discrepancies with the traditional rotational diagram method, which overestimated the ratios by 12.1% and 23.9%, respectively. Our $\chi^2$ approach also reduced uncertainties by up to 80% , providing more precise and reliable isotopic ratios. Additionally, we extended the analysis to isotopologues not covered in HITRAN, calculating vibrational and rotational constants through quantum chemical calculations. This allowed us to model subtle isotopic shifts induced by $^{13}$C and deuterium substitution, enabling accurate isotopologue detection in astrophysical environments. The Python package developed in this study facilitates efficient $\chi^2$ fitting and isotopic ratio analysis, making it a valuable tool for future high-resolution observations. This work highlights the critical role of advanced spectral models and fitting techniques in understanding isotopic fractionation and the chemical evolution of interstellar matter.
#### The Extraordinary Long-lasting Infrared Echo of PS16dtm Reveals an Extremely Energetic Nuclear Outburst

 - **Abstract**
 PS16dtm is one of the earliest reported candidate tidal disruption events (TDEs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and displays a remarkably bright and long-lived infrared (IR) echo revealed by multi-epoch photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). After a rapid rise in the first year, the echo remains persistently at a high state from July 2017 to July 2024, the latest epoch, and keeps an almost constant color. We have fitted the extraordinary IR emission with a refined dust echo model by taking into account the dust sublimation process. The fitting suggests that an extremely giant dust structure with a new inner radius of $\sim1.6$ pc and an ultra-high peak bolometric luminosity, i.e., $\sim6\times10^{46} \rm erg~s^{-1}$ for typical 0.1$\mu$m-sized silicate grain, is required to account for the IR echo. This work highlights the distinctive value of IR echoes in measuring the accurate intrinsic bolometric luminosity, and thus the total radiated energy of TDEs, which could be severely underestimated by traditional methods, i.e. probably by more than an order of magnitude in PS16dtm. Such large energetic output compared to normal TDEs could be boosted by the pre-existing accretion disk and gas clouds around the black hole. Our model can be validated in the near future by IR time-domain surveys such as Near-Earth Object (NEO) Surveyor, given the recent retirement of WISE. In addition, the potential for spatially resolving a receding dusty torus after a TDE could also be an exciting subject in the era of advanced IR interferometry.

 - **Abstract**
 The cicumgalactic medium (CGM) is a reservoir of metals and star-forming fuel. Most baryons in the universe are in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) or intergalactic medium (IGM). The baryon cycle -- how mass and metals reach the CGM from the inner regions of the galaxy and how gas from the CGM replenishes star-forming activity in the inner regions -- is an essential question in galaxy evolution. In this paper, we study the flow of mass and metals in a stacked sample of 2770 isolated halos from the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamic simulation. The mean gas flow as a function of radius and angle is similar across a large galactic mass range when accounting for different feedback modes. Although both star formation and black holes cause powerful outflows, the flows from star formation are more angularly restricted. Black hole feedback dominates massflow throughout the halo, while star-formation feedback mainly affects the inner region. When scaling by virial radius ($R_v$), large dynamical changes occur at $0.2R_v$ for most halos, suggesting a characteristic size for the inner galaxy. Despite radio mode feedback from black holes being the primary quenching mechanism in IllustrisTNG, a small population of high mass radio mode disks are able to form stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most luminous electromagnetic transients in the universe, providing unique insights into extreme astrophysical processes and serving as promising probes for cosmology. Unlike Type Ia supernovae, which have a unified explosion mechanism, GRBs cannot directly act as standard candles for tracing cosmic evolution at high redshifts due to significant uncertainties in their underlying physical origins. Empirical correlations derived from statistical analyses involving various GRB parameters provide valuable information regarding their intrinsic properties. In this brief review, we describe various correlations among GRB parameters involving the prompt and afterglow phases, discussing possible theoretical interpretations behind them. The scarcity of low-redshift GRBs poses a major obstacle to the application of GRB empirical correlations in cosmology, referred to as the circularity problem. We present various efforts aiming at calibrating GRBs to address this challenge and leveraging established empirical correlations to constrain cosmological parameters. The pivotal role of GRB sample quality in advancing cosmological research is underscored. Some correlations that could potentially be utilized as redshift indicators are also introduced.

 - **Abstract**
 The polarisation of light induced by aligned interstellar dust serves as a significant tool in investigating cosmic magnetic fields, dust properties, and poses a challenge in characterising the polarisation of the cosmic microwave background and other sources. To establish dust polarisation as a reliable tool, the physics of the grain alignment process needs to be studied thoroughly. The Magnetically enhanced Radiative Torque (MRAT) alignment is the only mechanism that can induce highly efficient alignment of grains with magnetic fields required by polarisation observations of the diffuse interstellar medium. Here, we aim to test the MRAT mechanism in starless cores using the multiwavelength polarisation from optical/NIR to far-IR/submm. Our numerical modelling of dust polarisation using the MRAT theory demonstrated that the alignment efficiency of starlight polarisation ($p_{\rm ext}/A_{\rm V}$) and the degree of thermal dust polarisation ($p_{\rm em}$) first decrease slowly with increasing visual extinction ($A_{\rm V}$) and then falls steeply as $\propto A^{-1}_{\rm V}$ at large $A_{\rm V}$ due to the loss of grain alignment, which explains the phenomenon known as polarisation holes. Visual extinction at the transition from shallow to steep slope ($A^{\rm loss}_{\rm V}$) increases with the maximum grain size. By applying physical profiles suitable for a starless core Pipe-109, our model successfully reproduces the existing observations of starlight polarisation at R-band ($0.65\,\mu$m) and H-band ($1.65\,\mu$m), as well as emission polarisation at submillimeter ($850\,\mu$m). Successful modelling of observational data requires perfect alignment of large grains as evidence of the MRAT mechanism, and larger maximum size with higher elongation at higher $A_{\rm V}$. The latter reveals the first evidence for the new model of anisotropic grain growth induced by magnetic grain alignment.

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the thermal stability of thin accretion disks in high-energy astrophysical systems, incorporating the effects of magnetic fields, winds, and coronae. We analyze how these factors influence disk stability, focusing on conditions under which magnetic fields enhance stability and on scenarios where winds and coronae can either stabilize or destabilize the disk. Our results reveal that increasing corona parameters raises disk thickness and reduces temperature, thereby affecting gas, radiation, and magnetic pressures. These interactions underscore the complex dependencies that shape accretion disk dynamics, offering insights into their structural and thermal behavior under varying physical conditions. The findings contribute to advancing theoretical models and numerical simulations of accretion processes in environments such as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries, where disk stability plays a critical role in observed emissions and variability patterns.

 - **Abstract**
 Several observational lines of evidence imply that a fraction of the dark matter in the Galaxy may be comprised of small cold clouds of molecular hydrogen. Such objects are difficult to detect because of their small size and low temperature, but they can reveal themselves with gamma radiation arising in interactions between such clouds and cosmic rays or as dark shadows cast on the optical, UV and X-ray sky background. In our work we use the data of Fermi LAT 4FGL-DR4 catalogue of gamma-ray sources together with the data of GALEX UV All-Sky Survey to search for small dark clouds of molecular hydrogen in the Solar neighbourhood. This approach allows us to put an upper limit on the local concentration of such objects: $n < 2.2 \times 10^{-11} {\mathrm{AU}^{-3}}$. Constraints (upper limits) on the total amount of matter in this form bound to the Sun strongly depend on the radial profile of the clouds' distribution and reside in $0.05-30~M_{\odot}$ mass range.
#### Quantifying the Impact of the Dust Torque on the Migration of Low-mass Planets II: The Role of Pebble Accretion in Planet Growth within a Global Planet Formation Model

 - **Abstract**
 Although dust constitutes only about 1% of the mass of a protoplanetary disk, recent studies demonstrate that it can exert a significant torque on low- and intermediate-mass planetary cores. We compute and quantify for the first time the influence of the dust torque on the evolution of growing planetary embryos as they move in a protoplanetary disk while growing via gas and pebble accretion. Our global model evolves the gaseous disk via viscous accretion and X-ray photoevaporation, while accounting for dust growth and evolution including coagulation, drift, and fragmentation. Our research indicates that dust torque significantly influences planetary migration, particularly driving substantial outward migration for planets forming within the water ice-line. This effect occurs due to an increased dust-to-gas mass ratio in the inner disk, resulting from inward pebble drift from outer regions. In contrast, for planets initially located beyond the water ice-line, the dust torque mitigates inward migration but does not significantly alter their paths, as the dust-to-gas ratio diminishes rapidly due to rapid pebble drift and the brief timescales of planet formation in these areas. These findings underscore the pivotal role of dust torque in shaping the migration patterns of low- and intermediate-mass planets, especially when enhanced dust concentrations in the inner disk amplify its effects
#### Looking into the faintEst WIth MUSE (LEWIS): Exploring the nature of ultra-diffuse galaxies in the Hydra I cluster III. Untangling UDG 32 from the stripped filaments of NGC 3314A with multi-wavelength data

 - **Abstract**
 UDG 32 is an ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) candidate in the Hydra I cluster that was discovered in the extended network of stellar filaments of the jellyfish galaxy NGC 3314A. This galaxy is affected by ram pressure stripping and it is hypothesised that UDG 32 may have formed from its stripped material. In this paper, we address whether UDG 32 can be associated with the stripped material of NGC 3314A and constrain its formation scenario in relation to its environment. We use new integral-field spectroscopic data from the MUSE large programme `LEWIS' in conjunction with deep multi-band photometry to constrain the kinematics and stellar populations of UDG 32. The new MUSE data allow us to reveal that the stripped material from NGC 3314A, traced by emission lines such as H$\alpha$, extends much further from its parent galaxy than previously known, completely overlapping with UDG 32 in projection, and with ram pressure induced star formation. We determine the line-of-sight velocity of UDG 32 ($v_{\rm LOS} = 3080\pm120$ km/s) and confirm that UDG 32 is part of the same kinematic structure as NGC 3314A, the Hydra I cluster south-east subgroup. By fitting the UV and optical spectral energy distribution, we constrain the stellar population properties of UDG 32. We determine its mass-weighted age to be $7.7^{+2.9}_{-2.8}$ Gyr and its metallicity to be [M/H] = $0.07^{+0.19}_{-0.32}$ dex. We confirm the presence of two globular clusters (GCs) in the MUSE field of view, bound to the Hydra I cluster rather than to UDG 32, thus part of the Hydra I intracluster GC population. The metal-rich and intermediate-age nature of UDG 32 points towards its formation from pre-enriched material in the south-east group of the Hydra I cluster that was liberated from a more massive galaxy via tidal or ram-pressure stripping, but we cannot establish a direct link to the ram-pressure stripped material from NGC 3314A.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the numerical stability of thermonuclear detonations in 1D accelerated reactive shocks and 2D binary collisions of equal mass, magnetized and unmagnetized white dwarf stars. To achieve high resolution at initiation sites, we devised geometric gridding and mesh velocity strategies specially adapted to the unique requirements of head-on collisional geometries, scenarios in which one expects maximum production of iron-group products. We study effects of grid resolution and the limiting of temperature, energy generation, and reactants for different stellar masses, separations, magnetic fields, initial compositions, detonation mechanisms, and limiter parameters across a range of cell sizes from 1 to 100 km. Our results set bounds on the parameter space of limiter amplitudes for which both temperature and energy limiting procedures yield consistent and monotonically convergent solutions. Within these bounds we find grid resolutions of 5 km or better are necessary for uncertainties in total released energy and iron-group products to drop below 10%. Intermediate mass products (e.g., calcium) exhibit similar convergence trends but with somewhat greater uncertainty. These conclusions apply equally to pure C/O WDs, multi-species compositions (including helium shells), magnetized and unmagnetized cores, and either single or multiple detonation scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Weak-emission-line QSOs (WLQs) are an enigmatic subclass of the QSO population, as their optical/UV spectra are marked by abnormally weak (or absent) emission lines. To obtain much-needed additional clues to the origin of this and other known peculiarities of WLQs, we have determined the 'ensemble' optical variability characteristics for a large, well-defined sample of 76 radio-quiet WLQs and also for a matched control sample comprising 603 normal radio-quiet QSOs. This analysis was done using their light-curves recorded in the $g$ and $r$ bands, under the ZTF survey during 2018-2024, with a typical cadence of 3 days. We find that, compared to normal QSOs, WLQs exhibit systematically milder optical variability on month/year-like time scales (by a factor of $\sim$ 1.76$\pm$0.05 in amplitude). We have independently verified this by carrying out an equivalent analysis of the V-band light-curves acquired under the CRTS during 2007- 2014, with a typical cadence of 10 days. This new observational differentiator between WLQs and normal QSOs may provide clues to understanding the intriguing nature of WLQs. It is proposed that the clumpiness of the torus material flowing into the central engine may play a key role in explaining the observed differences between the WLQs and normal QSOs.
