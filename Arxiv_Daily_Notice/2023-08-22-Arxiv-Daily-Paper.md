 - **Abstract**
 Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) are used to detect bright nanosecond-duration flashes of optical light originating from interactions of cosmic/gamma-rays in the atmosphere. A natural calibration source with similar characteristics does not exist; however, satellite-based laser systems provide a potential alternative. The CALIPSO satellite is one such facility which uses a suite of instruments to gather information about the atmosphere. Of particular interest is the CALIOP instrument, which emits 20-nanosecond laser pulses at 1064 nm and 532 nm at a rate of 20 Hz towards the Earth. The TAIGA-HiSCORE collaboration announced a detection of CALIOP laser pulses at the 37th ICRC in 2021, demonstrating that the laser footprint extends to at least tens of kilometers from the subsatellite point. We have used the VERITAS IACT to observe CALIPSO, and show here the results of using these observations to help to calibrate the array. We also discuss the potential of this technique for cross-calibration between different IACT facilities and for relative calibration between the telescopes of future large arrays.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we consider a comprehensive investigation of the cosmological model described by $f(R,T) = R + 2\lambda T$ (where $\lambda$ represents a free parameter) in light of the most recent observational data. By constraining the model using $Hubble$ and $Pantheon$ datasets, we determine its compatibility with the observed behavior of the Universe. For this purpose, we adopt a parametric form for the effective equation of state (EoS) parameter. This parametric form allows us to describe the evolution of the EoS parameter with respect to redshift and investigate its behavior during different cosmic epochs. The analysis of the deceleration parameter reveals an accelerating Universe with a present value of $q_0=-0.64^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$, indicating the current phase of accelerated expansion. The transition redshift is found to be $z_{tr}=0.53^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$, marking the epoch of transition from deceleration to acceleration. We also analyze the evolution of important cosmological parameters including density parameter, pressure, effective EoS, and stability. These findings collectively demonstrate the viability of the $f(R,T)$ cosmological model as a robust candidate capable of engendering the requisite negative pressure, thereby efficiently propelling cosmic expansion. Moreover, the undertaken stability analysis underscores the model's stability within the broader cosmic landscape. By providing the best-fit values for the coupling parameter $\lambda$, this approach motivates and encourages further explorations into the extensive landscape of this model and its potential applications across diverse realms of cosmology and astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 For bright transients such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), the Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) operates under event mode at early phases, which records incident positions and arrival time for each photon. The event file is able to be screened into many exposures to study the early light curve of GRBs with a high time resolution, including in particular the rapid brightening of the UV/Optical emission. Such a goal, however, is hampered for some extremely bright GRBs by the saturation in UVOT event images. For moderately saturated UVOT sources, in this work we develop the method proposed in Jin et al. (2023) to recover their photometries. The basic idea is to assume a stable point spread function (PSF) of UVOT images, for which the counts in the core region (i.e., an aperture of a radius of 5 arcsec) and the wing region (i.e., an annulus ranging from 15 arcsec to 25 arcsec) should be a constant and the intrinsic flux can be reliably inferred with data in the ring. We demonstrate that in a given band, a tight correlation does hold among the background-removed count rates in the core and the wing. With the new method, the bright limit of measuring range for UVOT V and B bands increases ~ 1.7 mag, while only ~ 0.7 mag for U band due to the lack of bright calibration sources. Systematic uncertainties are ~ 0.2 mag for V, B and U bands.

 - **Abstract**
 The destiny of complex organic molecules (COMs) in star-forming regions is interlinked with various evolutionary phases. Therefore, identifying these species in diversified environments of identical star-forming regions would help to comprehend their physical and chemical heritage. We identified multiple COMs utilizing the Large Program `Astrochemical Surveys At IRAM' (ASAI) data, dedicated to chemical surveys in Sun-like star-forming regions with the IRAM 30 m telescope. It was an unbiased survey in the millimetre regime, covering the prestellar core, protostar, outflow region, and protoplanetary disk phase. Here, we have reported some transitions of seven COMs, namely, methanol (CH3OH), acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), methyl formate (CH3OCHO), ethanol (C2H5OH), propynal (HCCCHO), dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3), and methyl cyanide (CH3CN) in some sources L1544, B1-b, IRAS4A, and SVS13A. We found a trend among these species from the derived abundances using the rotational diagram method and MCMC fit. We have found that the abundances of all of the COMs, except for HCCCHO, increase from the L1544 (prestellar core) and peaks at IRAS16293-2422 (class 0 phase). It is noticed that the abundance of these molecules correlate with the luminosity of the sources. The obtained trend is also visible from the previous interferometric observations and considering the beam dilution effect.
#### What can be learnt from a highly informative X-ray occultation event in  NGC 6814? A marvellous absorber

 - **Abstract**
 A unique X-ray occultation event in NGC 6814 during an XMM-Newton observation in 2016 has been reported, providing useful information of the absorber and the corona. We revisit the event with the aid of the hardness ratio (HR) - count rate (CR) plot and comparison with two other absorption-free XMM exposures in 2009 and 2021. NGC 6814 exhibits a clear "softer-when-brighter" variation pattern during the exposures, but the 2016 exposure significantly deviates from the other two in the HR - CR plot. While spectral fitting does yield transient Compton-thin absorption corresponding to the eclipse event in 2016, rather than easing the tension between exposures in the HR - CR plot, correcting the transient Compton-thin absorption results in new and severe deviation within the 2016 exposure. We show that the eclipsing absorber shall be clumpy (instead of a single Compton-thin cloud), with an inner denser region composed of both Compton-thin and Compton-thick clouds responsible for the previously identified occultation event, and an outer sparser region with Compton-thin clouds which eclipses the whole 2016 exposure. With this model, all the tension in the HR - CR plots could be naturally erased, with the observed spectral variability during the 2016 exposure dominated by the variation of absorption. Furthermore, the two warm absorbers (with different ionization and column densities but similar outflowing velocities) detected in the 2016 exposure shall also associate with the transient absorber, likely due to ablated or tidal stretched/disrupted fragments. This work highlights the unique usefulness of the HR - CR plot while analysing rare occultation events.

 - **Abstract**
 Cloud computing offers an opportunity to run compute-resource intensive climate models at scale by parallelising model runs such that datasets useful to the exoplanet community can be produced efficiently. To better understand the statistical distributions and properties of potentially habitable planetary atmospheres we implemented a parallelised climate modelling tool to scan a range of hypothetical atmospheres.Starting with a modern day Earth atmosphere, we iteratively and incrementally simulated a range of atmospheres to infer the landscape of the multi-parameter space, such as the abundances of biological mediated gases (\ce{O2}, \ce{CO2}, \ce{H2O}, \ce{CH4}, \ce{H2}, and \ce{N2}) that would yield `steady state' planetary atmospheres on Earth-like planets around solar-type stars. Our current datasets comprises of \numatmospheres simulated models of exoplanet atmospheres and is available publicly on the NASA Exoplanet Archive. Our scalable approach of analysing atmospheres could also help interpret future observations of planetary atmospheres by providing estimates of atmospheric gas fluxes and temperatures as a function of altitude. Such data could enable high-throughput first-order assessment of the potential habitability of exoplanetary surfaces and sepcan be a learning dataset for machine learning applications in the atmospheric and exoplanet science domain.

 - **Abstract**
 Double white dwarf (WD) merger process and their post-merger evolution are important in many fields of astronomy, such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, gravitational waves, etc. The evolutionary outcomes of double ultra-massive WD merger remnants are still a subject of debate, though the general consensus is that the merger remnant will collapse to form a neutron star. In this work, we investigate the evolution of a 2.20Msun merger remnant stemmed from the coalescence of double 1.10Msun ONe WDs. We find that the remnant ignites off-centre neon burning at the position near the surface of primary WD soon after the merger, resulting in the stable inwardly propagating oxygen/neon (O/Ne) flame. The final outcomes of the merger remnant are sensitive to the effect of convective boundary mixing. If the mixing cannot stall the O/Ne flame, the flame will reach the centre within 20 years, leading to the formation of super Chandrasekhar mass silicon core, and its final fate probably be neutron star (NS) through iron-core-collapse supernova. In contrast, if the convective mixing is effective enough to prevent the O/Ne flame from reaching the centre, the merger remnant will undergo electron capture supernova to form an ONeFe WD. Meanwhile, we find that the wind mass loss process may hardly alter the final fate of the remnant due to its fast evolution. Our results imply that the coalescence of double ONe WDs can form short lived giant like object, but the final outcomes (NS or ONeFe WD) are influenced by the uncertain convective mixing in O/Ne flame.

 - **Abstract**
 We compare the observational properties between $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O and summarize the observational parameters based on 7069 clouds sample from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) CO survey in a section of the third Galactic quadrant. We find that the $^{13}$CO angular area ($A_{\rm ^{13}CO}$) generally increases with that of $^{12}$CO ($A_{\rm ^{12}CO}$), and the ratio of $A_{\rm ^{13}CO}$ to $A_{\rm ^{12}CO}$ is 0.38 by linear fitting. We find that the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO flux are tightly correlated as $F_{\rm ^{13}CO}~=~0.17~ F_{\rm ^{12}CO}$ with both fluxes calculated within the $^{13}$CO-bright region. This indicates that the abundance $X_{\rm ^{13}CO}$ is a constant to be 6.5$^{+0.1}_{-0.5}$ $\times 10^{-7}$ for all samples under assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). Additionally, we observed that the X-factor is approximately constant in large sample molecular clouds. Similarly, we find $F_{\rm C^{18}O}~=~0.11~F_{\rm ^{13}CO}$ with both fluxes calculated within C$^{18}$O-bright region, which indicates that the abundance ratios ${X_{\rm ^{13}CO}/X_{\rm C^{18}O}}$ stays the same value 9.7$^{+0.6}_{-0.8}$ across the molecular clouds under LTE assumption. The linear relationships of $F_{\rm ^{12}CO}$ vs. $F_{\rm ^{13}CO}$ and $F_{\rm ^{13}CO}$ vs. $F_{\rm C^{18}O}$ hold not only for the $^{13}$CO-bright region or C$^{18}$O-bright region, but also for the entire molecular cloud scale with lower flux ratio. The abundance ratio ${X_{\rm ^{13}CO}/X_{\rm C^{18}O}}$ inside clouds shows a strong correlation with column density and temperature. This indicates that the ${X_{\rm ^{13}CO}/X_{\rm C^{18}O}}$ is dominated by a combination of chemical fractionation, selectively dissociation, and self-shielding effect inside clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 We present ground and space-based photometric observations of TOI-270 (L231-32), a system of three transiting planets consisting of one super-Earth and two sub-Neptunes discovered by TESS around a bright (K-mag=8.25) M3V dwarf. The planets orbit near low-order mean-motion resonances (5:3 and 2:1), and are thus expected to exhibit large transit timing variations (TTVs). Following an extensive observing campaign using 8 different observatories between 2018 and 2020, we now report a clear detection of TTVs for planets c and d, with amplitudes of $\sim$10 minutes and a super-period of $\sim$3 years, as well as significantly refined estimates of the radii and mean orbital periods of all three planets. Dynamical modeling of the TTVs alone puts strong constraints on the mass ratio of planets c and d and on their eccentricities. When incorporating recently published constraints from radial velocity observations, we obtain masses of $M_{\mathrm{b}}=1.48\pm0.18\,M_\oplus$, $M_{c}=6.20\pm0.31\,M_\oplus$ and $M_{\mathrm{d}}=4.20\pm0.16\,M_\oplus$ for planets b, c and d, respectively. We also detect small, but significant eccentricities for all three planets : $e_\mathrm{b} =0.0167\pm0.0084$, $e_{c} =0.0044\pm0.0006$ and $e_{d} = 0.0066\pm0.0020$. Our findings imply an Earth-like rocky composition for the inner planet, and Earth-like cores with an additional He/H$_2$O atmosphere for the outer two. TOI-270 is now one of the best-constrained systems of small transiting planets, and it remains an excellent target for atmospheric characterization.
#### 3D hydrodynamics simulations of a 3 $M_{\odot}$ core-helium burning star

 - **Abstract**
 The inner structure of core-helium burning (CHeB) stars remains uncertain due to the yet unknown nature of mixing at the boundary of their cores. Large convective cores beyond a bare Schwarzschild model are favoured both from theoretical arguments and from asteroseismological constraints. However, the exact nature of this extra mixing, and in particular the possible presence of semiconvective layers, is still debated. In this work, we approach this problem through a new avenue by performing the first full-sphere 3D hydrodynamics simulations of the interiors of CHeB stars. We use the PPMstar explicit gas dynamics code to simulate the inner 0.45 $M_{\odot}$ of a 3 $M_{\odot}$ CHeB star. Simulations are performed using different Cartesian grid resolutions (768$^3$, 1152$^3$ and 1728$^3$) and heating rates. We use two different initial states, one based on MESA's predictive mixing scheme (which yields a large overshoot region) and one based on the convective premixing approach (which exhibits a semiconvective interface). The general behaviour of the flow in the convective core and in the stable envelope (where internal gravity waves are observed) is consistent with our recent simulations of core convection in massive main-sequence stars, and so are the various scaling relations. The semiconvective layers are dominated by strong internal gravity waves that do not produce measurable species mixing, but overshooting motions from the convective core gradually homogenize the semiconvective interface. This process can possibly completely erase the semiconvective layers, which would imply that CHeB stars do not harbour a semiconvection zone.
