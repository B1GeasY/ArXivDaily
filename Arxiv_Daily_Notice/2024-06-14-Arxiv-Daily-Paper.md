 - **Abstract**
 Ultramassive white dwarfs with masses $M\gtrsim 1.1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ probe extreme physics near the Chandrasekhar limit. Despite the rapid increase in observations, it is still unclear how many harbour carbon-oxygen (CO) versus oxygen-neon (ONe) cores. The origin of these white dwarfs and their strong magnetic fields - single stellar evolution or a stellar merger - is another open question. The steep mass-radius relation of the relativistic ultramassive white dwarfs shortens their crystallization time $t_{\rm cryst}$, such that the recently proposed crystallization dynamo mechanism may present an alternative to mergers in explaining the early appearance of magnetism in the observed population. However, the magnetic diffusion time from the convective dynamo to the white dwarf's surface delays the magnetic field's breakout time $t_{\rm break}>t_{\rm cryst}$. We compute $t_{\rm break}(M)$ for CO and ONe ultramassive white dwarfs and compare it to the local 40 pc volume-limited sample. We find that the breakout time from CO cores is too long to account for the observations. ONe crystallization dynamos remain a viable option, but their surrounding non-convective envelopes comprise only a few per cent of the total mass, such that $t_{\rm break}$ is highly sensitive to the details of stellar evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Warm Jupiters are ideal laboratories for testing the limitations of current tools for atmospheric studies. The cross-correlation technique is a commonly used method to investigate the atmospheres of close-in planets, leveraging their large orbital velocities to separate the spectrum of the planet from that of the star. Warm Jupiter atmospheres predominantly consist of molecular species, notably water, methane and carbon monoxide, often accompanied by clouds and hazes muting their atmospheric features. In this study, we investigate the atmospheres of six warm Jupiters K2-139 b, K2-329 b, TOI- 3362 b, WASP-130 b, WASP-106 b, and TOI-677 b to search for water absorption using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, reporting non-detections for all targets. These non-detections are partially attributed to planets having in-transit radial velocity changes that are typically too small to distinguish between the different components (star, planet, Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and telluric contamination), as well as the relatively weak planetary absorption lines as compared to the S/N of the spectra. We simulate observations for the upcoming high-resolution spectrograph ANDES at the Extremely Large Telescope for the two favourable planets on eccentric orbits, TOI-3362b and TOI-677 b, searching for water, carbon monoxide, and methane. We predict a significant detection of water and CO, if ANDES indeed covers the K-band, in the atmospheres of TOI-677 b and a tentative detection of water in the atmosphere of TOI-3362b. This suggests that planets on highly eccentric orbits with favourable orbital configurations present a unique opportunity to access cooler atmospheres.
#### Large scale compressible turbulence in the ism of CSWA13, a star-Forming Lensed Galaxy at z = 1.87 with outflowing wind

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, an observational paper presented spatially resolved observations of a wind outflow in CSWA13, a gravitationally lensed Star-Forming galaxy at z = 1.87. The gravitational lensing allowed for a substantially improved spatial and kinematic resolution of the wind and of the nebular gas. In this paper we take advantage of the resolved data to test for the existence of turbulence and to study its nature. We derive the spatial structure functions of the residual nebular and wind velocities along the major axis of the galaxy. The structure functions, of both velocity fields, reveal a supersonic compressible large scale turbulence. The turbulent timescale corresponding to the largest scale is about 200 Myr, an order of magnitude larger than the estimated age of the wind and of the young stars. This implies that the turbulence in the ism formed well before the wind and the young stars. Given the large spatial scale of the turbulence, it is plausible that the source of the turbulence is a large scale one e.g. a merger or tidal event that triggered the formation of molecular clouds, in the cores of which the young stars formed. A steepening of the structure functions on the smaller scales provides an estimate of the effective depth along the line of sight of the turbulent layer. The latter turns out to be about 2kpc. S

 - **Abstract**
 Previous research suggests that impacts between planetary embryos and planetesimals during the late stages of planet formation can often determine the percentages of core and mantle material that compose the newly formed planets in a system. Previous studies have attempted to include the composition-changing effects of these collisions in N-body simulations of planet formation, often as post-processing codes. In this paper, we present the Differentiated Body Composition Tracker, a new post-processing tool that uses collisional data collected from the N-body integrator REBOUND to determine the amount of core and mantle material that is transferred between colliding objects and the resulting fragments during an impact. We demonstrate how this code works using the data from 50 REBOUND simulations of planet formation and explore how the parameters in the code affect the core mass fractions of the remaining objects from these simulations. We then investigate how non-uniform distributions of core material across an initial disc affect the final core mass fractions of planets. Under ideal conditions, we find that a combination of giant impacts and planetary embryos enriched in core material could create some of the iron-rich planets that have been discovered.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Recent astrometric and spectroscopic surveys of OB stars have revealed a few stellar-mass black holes (BHs) with orbital periods as low as 10 days. No X-ray counterpart has been detected, due to the absence of a radiatively efficient accretion disk around the BH. Yet, dissipative processes in the hot, dilute and strongly magnetized plasma around the BH (so-called BH corona) can still lead to non-thermal X-ray emission (e.g. synchrotron). Aims. We determine the X-ray luminosity distribution from BH+OB star binaries up to orbital periods of a few thousand days. Methods. We use detailed binary evolution models computed with MESA for initial primary masses of 10-90 $M_{\odot}$ and orbital periods from 1-3000 d. The X-ray luminosity is computed for a broad range of radiative efficiencies. Results. We show that particle acceleration through magnetic reconnection can heat the BH corona. A substantial fraction of the gravitational potential energy from the accreted plasma is converted into non-thermal X-ray emission. Our population synthesis analysis predicts at least 28 (up to 72) BH+OB star binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to produce X-ray luminosity above 10$^{31}$ erg$\,$s$^{-1}$, observable through focused Chandra observations. We identify a population of SB1 systems in the LMC and HD96670 in the Milky Way comprising O stars with unseen companions of masses above 2.3 $M_{\odot}$ that aligns well with our predictions. The predicted luminosities of the OB companions to these X-ray-emitting BHs are 10$^{4.5-5.5}$ $L_{\odot}$. Conclusions. These results make the case for long-time exposure in X-rays of the stellar-mass BH candidates identified around OB stars. It will constrain the underlying population of X-ray-faint BHs, the evolution from single to double degenerate binaries, and the progenitors of gravitational wave mergers. (Abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes bearing magnetic charges may bypass the constraints imposed by Hawking radiation, thereby enabling reasonable present-day populations, even for masses below $10^{15}\,\text{g}$ -- a range previously considered improbable. They could, therefore, conceivably contribute to a component of dark matter. We investigate novel Faraday rotation signatures exhibited by primordial magnetic black holes while also establishing new Parker-type bounds on their populations. For the latter, we bound the dark matter fraction from intergalactic magnetic fields in cosmic voids $\left(f_{\text{DM}} \lesssim 10^{-8}\right)$ and cosmic web filaments $\left(f_{\text{ DM}} \lesssim 10^{-4}\right)$, notably eclipsing previous bounds. Exploring Faraday rotation effects, we discern a pronounced rotation of the polarization angle and the rotation measure values for extremal primordial magnetic black holes with masses $M^{\text{ ex.}}_{\text{ BH}}\gtrsim 10^{-6}~ \text{M}_\odot$. This makes them potentially detectable in current observations. A comparative investigation finds that the effects are notably greater than for a neutron star, like a Magnetar, with a similar magnetic field at the surface. Moreover, the polarization angle maps for primordial magnetic black holes exhibit unique features, notably absent in other astrophysical magnetic configurations. In this context, we also introduce a simple integral measure, offering a quantitative measure for their discrimination in many scenarios. These traits potentially suggest a robust avenue for their observational detection and differentiation.
#### Testing MOND using the dynamics of nearby stellar streams

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar halo of the Milky Way is built up, at least in part, from debris from past mergers. Stars from such merger events define substructures in phase-space, for example in the form of streams, which are groups of stars moving on similar trajectories. The nearby Helmi streams discovered more than two decades ago are a well-known example. Using 6D phase-space information from the Gaia space mission, Dodd et al. (2022) have recently reported that the Helmi streams are split into two clumps in angular momentum space. Such substructure can be explained and sustained in time if the dark matter halo of the Milky Way takes a prolate shape in the region probed by the orbits of the stars in the streams. Here, we explore the behaviour of the two clumps identified in the Helmi streams in a Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) framework to test this alternative model of gravity. We perform orbit integrations of Helmi streams member stars in a simplified MOND model of the Milky Way and using the more sophisticated Phantom of RAMSES simulation framework. We find with both approaches that the two Helmi streams clumps do not retain their identity and dissolve after merely 100 Myr. This extremely short timescale would render the detection of two separate clumps as very unlikely in MONDian gravity. The observational constraints provided by the streams, which MOND fails to reproduce in its current formulation, could potentially also be used to test other alternative gravity models.

 - **Abstract**
 W49A is a prominent giant molecular cloud (GMC) that exhibits strong star formation activities, yet its structural and kinematic properties remain uncertain. Our study aims to investigate the large-scale structure and kinematics of W49A, and elucidate the role of filaments and hub-filament systems (HFSs) in its star formation activity. We utilized continuum data from Herschel and the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) as well as the molecular lines 12CO (3-2), 13CO (3-2), and C18O (3-2) to identify filaments and HFS structures within W49A. Further analysis focused on the physical properties, kinematics, and mass transport within these structures. Additionally, recombination line emission from the H I/OH/Recombination (THOR) line survey was employed to trace the central H II region and ionized gas. Our findings reveal that W49A comprises one blue-shifted (B-S) HFS and one red-shifted (R-S) HFS, each with multiple filaments and dense hubs. Notably, significant velocity gradients were detected along these filaments, indicative of material transport toward the hubs. High mass accretion rates along the filaments facilitate the formation of massive stars in the HFSs. Furthermore, the presence of V-shaped structures around clumps in position-velocity diagrams suggests ongoing gravitational collapse and local star formation within the filaments. Our results indicate that W49A consists of one R-S HFS and one B-S HFS, and that the material transport from filaments to the hub promotes the formation of massive stars in the hub. These findings underscore the significance of HFSs in shaping the star formation history of W49A.

 - **Abstract**
 Dense outflowing gas, traced by transitions of molecules with large dipole moment, is important for understanding mass loss and feedback of massive star formation. HCN 3-2 and HCO$^+$ 3-2 are good tracers of dense outflowing molecular gas, which are closely related to active star formation. In this study, we present on-the-fly (OTF) mapping observations of HCN 3-2 and HCO$^+$ 3-2 toward a sample of 33 massive star-forming regions using the 10-m Submillimeter Telescope (SMT). With the spatial distribution of line wings of HCO$^+$ 3-2 and HCN 3-2, outflows are detected in 25 sources, resulting in a detection rate of 76$\%$. The optically thin H$^{13}$CN and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ 3-2 lines are used to identify line wings as outflows and estimate core mass. The mass $M_{out}$, momentum $P_{out}$, kinetic energy $E_{K}$, force $F_{out}$ and mass loss rate $\dot M_{out}$ of outflow and core mass, are obtained for each source. A sublinear tight correlation is found between the mass of dense molecular outflow and core mass, with an index of $\sim$ 0.8 and a correlation coefficient of 0.88.
#### TOI-837 b: characterisation, formation and evolutionary history of an infant warm Saturn-mass planet

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to determine the fundamental properties of the $\sim$35 Myr old star TOI-837 and its close-in Saturn-sized planet, and to investigate the system's formation and evolutionary history. We analysed TESS photometry and HARPS spectroscopic data, measured stellar and planetary parameters, and characterised the stellar activity. We performed population synthesis simulations to track the formation history of TOI-837 $b$, and to reconstruct its possible internal structure. We investigated the planetary atmospheric evolution through photo-evaporation, and quantified the prospects for atmospheric characterisation with JWST. TOI-837 $b$ has radius and mass similar to those of Saturn ($r_b$=9.71$^{+0.93}_{-0.60}$ \rearth, $m_b$=116$^{+17}_{-18}$ M$_\odot$, and $\rho_b$=0.68$^{+0.20}_{-0.18}$ gcm$^{-3}$), on a primordial circular orbit. Population synthesis and early migration simulations suggest that the planet could have originated between 2-4 au, and have either a large and massive core, or a smaller Saturn-like core, depending on the opacity of the protoplanetary gas and on the growth rate of the core. We found that photo-evaporation produced negligible effects even at early ages (3-10 Myr). Transmission spectroscopy with JWST is very promising, and expected to provide constraints on atmospheric metallicity, abundance of H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$ molecules, and to probe the presence of refractory elements. TOI-837 offers valuable prospects for follow-up observations, which are needed for a thorough characterisation. JWST will help to better constraining the formation and evolution history of the system, and understand whether TOI-837 $b$ is a Saturn-analogue.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical Cepheids are the archetype of the standard candle, thanks to the period-luminosity relation which allows to measure their intrinsic brightness. They are also relatively young and bright, potentially making them excellent tracers of the young stellar population that is responsible for shaping the visible aspect of our Galaxy, the Milky Way. However, being observers embedded in the dusty interstellar medium of the Galaxy, deriving reliable photometric distances to classical Cepheids of the Milky Way is a challenge. The typical approach is to use reddening-free indices, such as Wesenheit magnitudes, to obviate the need for an extinction correction. However, this approach is not reliable - especially toward the inner Galaxy - as its assumption of a universal total-to-selective extinction ratio is not satisfied, particularly in lines-of-sight where the extinction is high and crosses spiral arms. We instead estimate new distances for 3425 Cepheids based on mid-IR photometry from WISE, which suffers minimally from extinction, and by adopting a 3D extinction map to calculate the necessary (albeit small) extinction corrections. We show that our distances are consistent with Gaia's parallaxes for the subset with relative parallax errors smaller than 10%, verifying that our mean distance errors are of the order of 13% and that the mean parallax zero point for this subsample is 7 $\mu$as. The catalog of Cepheid distances is made available online.
#### The Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments: CASCADE III. The large scale distribution of DCO+, DNC and DCN in the DR21 filament

 - **Abstract**
 Deuterated molecules and their molecular D/H-ratios (RD(D)) are important diagnostic tools to study the physical conditions of star-forming regions. The degree of deuteration, RD(D), can be significantly enhanced over the elemental D/H-ratio depending on physical parameters. Within the Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments (CASCADE), we aim to explore the large-scale distribution of deuterated molecules in the nearby Cygnus-X region. We focus on the analysis of large-scale structures of deuterated molecules in the filamentary region hosting the prominent Hii region DR21 and DR21(OH). Here we discuss the HCO+, HNC and HCN molecules and their deuterated isotopologues DCO+, DNC and DCN. The spatial distributions of integrated line emissions from DCO+, DNC, and DCN reveal morphological differences. DCO+ displays the most extended emission, characterized by several prominent peaks. Likewise, DNC exhibits multiple peaks, although its emission appears less extended compared to DCO+. In contrast to the extended emission of DCO+ and DNC, DCN appears the least extended, with distinct peaks. Focusing only on the regions where all three molecules are observed, the mean deuteration ratios for each species are 0.01 for both DNC and DCN, and = 0.005 for DCO+. Anti-correlations are found with deuterated molecules and dust temperature or N(H2). The strongest anti-correlation is found with RD(DCO+) and N(H2). The anti-correlation of RD(DCO+) and N(H2) is suggested to be a result of a combination of an increased photodissociation degree and shocks. A strong positive correlation between the ratio of integrated intensities of DCN and DNC with their 13C-isotopologues, are found in high column density regions. The positive relationship between the ratios implies that the D-isotopologue of the isomers could potentially serve as a tracer for the kinetic gas temperature.

 - **Abstract**
 The VISTA Variables in the Via Láctea Extended Survey (VVVX) enables exploration of previously uncharted territories within the inner Milky Way (MW), particularly those obscured by stellar crowding and intense extinction. Our objective is to identify and investigate new star clusters to elucidate their intrinsic characteristics. Specifically, we are focused on uncovering new candidate Globular Clusters (GCs) situated at low Galactic latitudes, with the ultimate goal of completing the census of the MW GC system. Leveraging a combination of Near-InfraRed (NIR) data from the VVVX survey and Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), along with optical photometry and precise proper motions (PMs) from the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3), we are conducting a systematic characterisation of new GCs. As a result, we report the discovery and characterisation of four new Galactic clusters named FSR 1700, FSR 1415, CWNU 4193, and Teutsch 67, all located within the MW disk. We estimate a wide range of reddening, with values ranging from 0.44 to 0.73 mag for E(J-Ks). The heliocentric distances span from 10.3 to 13.2 kpc. Additionally, we determine their metallicities and ages, finding a range of -0.85 to -0.75 dex for [Fe/H] and ages approximately close to 11 Gyr, respectively. FSR 1415 is an exception, it is an old open cluster with age = 3 Gyr and [Fe/H] = -0.10. Furthermore, we fitted the radial density profiles to derive their structural parameters like tidal radius, core radius, and concentration parameters. In conclusion, based on their positions, kinematics, metallicities, and ages, and comparing our findings with existing literature, we categorise FSR 1700, Teutsch 67 and CWNU 4193 as genuine GC candidates, while FSR 1415 is an old open cluster exhibiting characteristics of a post core-collapse cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the effects of rotation in stellar evolution is key to modelling early-type stars, half of which have equatorial velocities over 100 km/s. The nearby star Altair is an example of such fast-rotating stars, and furthermore, it has the privilege of being modelled by a detailed 2D concordance model that reproduces most of its observables. The aim of this paper is to include new asteroseismic frequencies to improve our knowledge of Altair, especially its age. We processed images of Altair obtained during July 2022 by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite using the halo photometry technique to obtain its light curve over this observation period. By analysing the light curve, we derived a set of 22 new frequencies in the oscillation spectrum of Altair and confirmed 12 previously known frequencies. Compared with model predictions, we could associate ten frequencies with ten axisymmetric modes. This identification is based on the modelled visibility of the modes. Moreover, nine of the modelled frequencies can be adjusted to simultaneously match their corresponding observed frequencies, once the core hydrogen mass fraction of the concordance model is set to $X_{\rm core}/X_{\rm ini}\simeq0.972$, with $X_{\rm ini}=0.739$. Using the combined results of a 1D MESA model computing the pre-main sequence and a 2D time-dependent ESTER model computing the main sequence, we find that this core hydrogen abundance sets the age of Altair to 88$\pm$10 Myrs, which is slightly younger than previous estimates.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery and early observations of the nearby Type II supernova (SN) 2024ggi in NGC 3621 at 6.64 +/- 0.3 Mpc. The SN was caught 5.8 (+1.9 -2.9) hours after its explosion by the ATLAS survey. Early-phase, high-cadence, and multi-band photometric follow-up was performed by the Kinder (Kilonova Finder) project, collecting over 1000 photometric data points within a week. The combined o- and r-band light curves show a rapid rise of 3.3 magnitudes in 13.7 hours, much faster than SN 2023ixf (another recent, nearby, and well-observed SN II). Between 13.8 and 18.8 hours after explosion SN 2024ggi became bluer, with u-g colour dropping from 0.53 to 0.15 mag. The rapid blueward evolution indicates a wind shock breakout (SBO) scenario. No hour-long brightening expected for the SBO from a bare stellar surface was detected during our observations. The classification spectrum, taken 17 hours after the SN explosion, shows flash features of high-ionization species such as Balmer lines, He I, C III, and N III. Detailed light curve modeling reveals critical insights into the properties of the circumstellar material (CSM). Our favoured model has an explosion energy of 2 x 10^51 erg, a mass-loss rate of 10^-3 solar_mass/yr (with an assumed 10 km/s wind), and a confined CSM radius of 6 x 10^14 cm. The corresponding CSM mass is 0.4 solar_mass. Comparisons with SN 2023ixf highlight that SN 2024ggi has a smaller CSM density, resulting in a faster rise and fainter UV flux. The extensive dataset and the involvement of citizen astronomers underscore that a collaborative network is essential for SBO searches, leading to more precise and comprehensive SN characterizations.
