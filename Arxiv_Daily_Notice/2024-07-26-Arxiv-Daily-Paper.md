#### Axisymmetric Dynamos Sustained by Ohm's Law in a Nearly-Spherical Rotating Viscous Fluid

 - **Abstract**
 This work tackles a significant challenge in dynamo theory: the possibility of long-term amplification and maintenance of an axisymmetric magnetic field. We introduce a novel model that allows for non-trivial axially-symmetric steady-state solutions for the magnetic field, particularly when the dynamo operates primarily within a "nearly-spherical" toroidal volume inside a fluid shell surrounding a solid core. In this model, Ohm's law is generalized to include the restoring friction force, which aligns the velocity of the shell with the rotational speed of the inner core and outer mantle. Our findings reveal that, in this context, Cowling's theorem and the neutral point argument are modified, leading to magnetic energy growth for a suitable choice of toroidal flow. The global equilibrium magnetic field that emerges from our model exhibits a dipolar character.

 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs (BD) are model degenerate in age and mass. High-contrast imaging and spectroscopy of BD companions to host stars where the mass and age can be independently constrained by dynamics and stellar age indicators respectively provide valuable tests of BD evolution models. In this paper, we present a new epoch of Subaru/CHARIS H- and K-band observations of one such previously discovered system, HD 33632 Ab. We reanalyze the mass and orbit using our new epoch of extracted relative astrometry, and fit extracted spectra to the newest generation of equilibrium, disequilibrium, and cloudy spectral and evolution models for BDs. No spectral model perfectly agrees with evolutionary tracks and the derived mass and age, instead favoring a somewhat younger BD than the host star's inferred age. This tension can potentially be resolved using atmosphere and evolution models that consider both clouds and disequilibrium chemistry simultaneously, or by additional future spectra at higher resolution or in other band passes. Photometric measurements alone remain consistent with the luminosity predicted by evolutionary tracks. Our work highlights the importance of considering complexities like clouds, disequilibrium chemistry, and composition when comparing spectral models to evolutionary tracks.

 - **Abstract**
 With the growing number of detections of binary black hole mergers, we are beginning to probe structure in the distribution of masses. A recent study by Schneider et al. proposes that isolated binary evolution of stripped stars naturally gives rise to the peaks at chirp masses $\sim 8 M_\odot$, $14 M_\odot$ in the chirp mass distribution and explains the dearth of black holes between $\approx 10-12 M_\odot$ in chirp mass. The gap in chirp mass results from an apparent gap in the component mass distribution between $m_1, m_2 \approx 10-15 M_\odot$ and the specific pairing of these black holes. This component mass gap results from the variation in core compactness of the progenitor, where a drop in compactness of Carbon-Oxygen core mass will no longer form black holes from core collapse. We develop a population model motivated by this scenario to probe the structure of the component mass distribution of binary black holes consisting of two populations: 1) two peak components to represent black holes formed in the compactness peaks, and 2) a powerlaw component to account for any polluting events, these are binaries that may have formed from different channels (e.g. dynamical). We perform hierarchical Bayesian inference to analyse the events from the third gravitational-wave transient catalogue (GWTC-3) with this model. We find that there is a preference for the lower mass peak to drop off sharply at $\sim 11 M_\odot$ and the upper mass peak to turn on at $\sim 13 M_\odot$, in line with predictions from Schneider et al. However, there is no clear evidence for a gap. We also find mild support for the two populations to have different spin distributions. In addition to these population results, we highlight observed events of interest that differ from the expected population distribution of compact objects formed from stripped stars.
#### Stellar Models are Reliable at Low Metallicity: An Asteroseismic Age for the Ancient Very Metal-Poor Star KIC 8144907

 - **Abstract**
 Very metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]<-2) are important laboratories for testing stellar models and reconstructing the formation history of our galaxy. Asteroseismology is a powerful tool to probe stellar interiors and measure ages, but few asteroseismic detections are known in very metal-poor stars and none have allowed detailed modeling of oscillation frequencies. We report the discovery of a low-luminosity Kepler red giant (KIC 8144907) with high S/N oscillations, [Fe/H]=-2.66+/-0.08 and [alpha/Fe]=0.38+/-0.06, making it by far the most metal-poor star to date for which detailed asteroseismic modeling is possible. By combining the oscillation spectrum from Kepler with high-resolution spectroscopy we measure an asteroseismic mass and age of 0.79+/-0.02(ran)+/-0.01(sys) Msun and 12.0+/-0.6(ran)+/-0.4(sys) Gyr, with remarkable agreement across different codes and input physics, demonstrating that stellar models and asteroseismology are reliable for very metal-poor stars when individual frequencies are used. The results also provide a direct age anchor for the early formation of the Milky Way, implying that substantial star formation did not commence until redshift z~3 (if the star formed in-situ) or that the Milky Way has undergone merger events for at least ~12 Gyr (if the star was accreted by a dwarf satellite merger such as Gaia Enceladus).

 - **Abstract**
 NGC 6357, a star-forming complex at $\sim 1.7$ kpc from the Sun, contains giant molecular clouds and three prominent star clusters alongside with HII regions, very massive stars and thousands of young stellar objects in different evolutionary stages. We present a combined infrared kinematic and time domain study of the line of sight towards this region enabled by the VVVX survey. In terms of kinematics, a novel discovery emerges: an asymmetrical distribution in the vector point diagram. Some stars in the sample exhibit spatial proximity to dusty regions, with their proper motions aligned with filament projections, hinting at a younger population linked to triggered star formation. However, this distribution could also stem from an asymmetric stellar expansion event within NGC 6357, warranting further investigation. Comparing this data with Gaia revealed inconsistencies likely due to high extinction levels in the region. Additionally, owing to accretion episodes and surface cool spots, young stars display high variability. Using the $K_s$-band time series data, we overcome the extreme levels of extinction towards the region, and compile a catalogue of $774$ infrared light curves of young stars. Each light curve has been characterized in terms of asymmetry and periodicity, to infer the dominant underlying physical mechanism. These findings are then correlated with evolutionary stages, aiming to uncover potential age disparities among the observed stars. This study contributes to our understanding the intricate dynamics and evolutionary processes within NGC 6357, offering valuable insights into the formation and development of stellar populations within such complex environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays (CRs) are the primary driver of ionization in star forming molecular clouds (MCs). Despite their potential impacts on gas dynamics and chemistry, no simulations of star cluster formation following the creation of individual stars have included explicit cosmic ray transport (CRT) to date. We conduct the first numerical simulations following the collapse of a $2000 M_{\odot}$ MC and the subsequent star formation including CRT using the STARFORGE framework implemented in the GIZMO code. We show that when CR-transport is streaming-dominated, the CR energy in the cloud is strongly attenuated due to energy losses from the streaming instability. Consequently, in a Milky Way like environment the median CR ionization rate (CRIR) in the cloud is low ($ \zeta \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-19} \rm s^{-1}$) during the main star forming epoch of the calculation and the impact of CRs on the star formation in the cloud is limited. However, in high-CR environments, the CR distribution in the cloud is elevated ($\zeta \lesssim 6 \times 10^{-18}$), and the relatively higher CR pressure outside the cloud causes slightly earlier cloud collapse and increases the star formation efficiency (SFE) by $50 \%$ to $\sim 13 \%$. The initial mass function (IMF) is similar in all cases except with possible variations in a high-CR environment. Further studies are needed to explain the range of ionization rates observed in MCs and explore star formation in extreme CR environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Bayesian inference for inverse problems hinges critically on the choice of priors. In the absence of specific prior information, population-level distributions can serve as effective priors for parameters of interest. With the advent of machine learning, the use of data-driven population-level distributions (encoded, e.g., in a trained deep neural network) as priors is emerging as an appealing alternative to simple parametric priors in a variety of inverse problems. However, in many astrophysical applications, it is often difficult or even impossible to acquire independent and identically distributed samples from the underlying data-generating process of interest to train these models. In these cases, corrupted data or a surrogate, e.g. a simulator, is often used to produce training samples, meaning that there is a risk of obtaining misspecified priors. This, in turn, can bias the inferred posteriors in ways that are difficult to quantify, which limits the potential applicability of these models in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose addressing this issue by iteratively updating the population-level distributions by retraining the model with posterior samples from different sets of observations and showcase the potential of this method on the problem of background image reconstruction in strong gravitational lensing when score-based models are used as data-driven priors. We show that starting from a misspecified prior distribution, the updated distribution becomes progressively closer to the underlying population-level distribution, and the resulting posterior samples exhibit reduced bias after several updates.
#### TIC441725813: A new bright hybrid sdB pulsator with differential core/envelope rotation

 - **Abstract**
 We present the detailed analysis of a new hybrid (p- and g-mode) sdB pulsator, TIC441725813 (TYC 4427-1021-1), discovered and monitored by TESS over 670 days. The TESS light curves available for this star were analysed using prewhitening techniques to extract mode frequencies accurately. The pulsation spectrum is then interpreted through methods that include asymptotic period spacing relationships and rotational multiplets identification. We also exploited a high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), low-resolution spectrum of TIC441725813 using grids of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) model atmospheres to derive its atmospheric parameters. Interestingly, several frequency multiplets interpreted as rotational splittings of deep-probing g-modes indicate a slow rotation period of at least $85.3 \pm 3.6$ day, while splittings of mostly envelope-probing p-modes suggest a significantly shorter rotation period of $17.9 \pm 0.7$ day, which implies the core (mainly the helium mantle with possibly the deeper partially-mixed helium-burning core that it surrounds) rotates at least ~4.7 times slower than the envelope. The radial velocity curves indicate that TIC441725813 is in a close binary system with a low-luminosity companion, possibly a white dwarf. While elusive in the available TESS photometry, a low-frequency signal that would correspond to a period of $\sim 6.7$ h is found, albeit at low S/N. TIC441725813 is a particularly interesting sdB star whose envelope rotates faster than the core. We hypothesise that this might be caused by the effects of tidal interaction with a companion, although in the present case, the presence of such a companion will have to be further investigated. This analysis paves the way toward a more detailed seismic probing of TIC441725813 using optimisation techniques, which will be presented in a second paper.

 - **Abstract**
 NH$_{3}$(ammonia) plays a critical role in the chemistry of star and planet formation, yet uncertainties in its binding energy (BE) values complicate accurate estimates of its abundances. Recent research suggests a multi-binding energy approach, challenging the previous single-value notion. In this work, we use different values of NH$_{3}$ binding energy to examine its effects on the NH$_{3}$ abundances and, consequently, in the early evolution of protostellar cores. Using a gas-grain chemical network, we systematically vary the values of NH$_{3}$ binding energies in a model Class 0 protostellar core and study the effects of these binding energies on the NH$_{3}$ abundances. Our simulations indicate that abundance profiles of NH$_{3}$ are highly sensitive to the binding energy used, particularly in the warmer inner regions of the core. Higher binding energies lead to lower gas-phase NH$_{3}$ abundances, while lower values of binding energy have the opposite effect. Furthermore, this BE-dependent abundance variation of NH$_{3}$ significantly affects the formation pathways and abundances of key species such as HNC, HCN, and CN. Our tests also reveal that the size variation of the emitting region due to binding energy becomes discernible only with beam sizes of 10 arcsec or less. These findings underscore the importance of considering a range of binding energies in astrochemical models and highlight the need for higher resolution observations to better understand the subtleties of molecular cloud chemistry and star formation processes.
#### The operationally ready full three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D MHD) model from the Sun to Earth: COCONUT+Icarus

 - **Abstract**
 Solar wind modelling has become a crucial area of study due to the increased dependence of modern society on technology, navigation, and power systems. Accurate space weather forecasts can predict upcoming threats to Earth's geospace. In this study, we examine a novel full magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) chain from the Sun to Earth. The goal of this study is to demonstrate the capabilities of the full MHD modelling chain from the Sun to Earth by finalising the implementation of the full MHD coronal model into the COolfluid COroNa UnsTructured (COCONUT) model and coupling it to the MHD heliospheric model Icarus. The resulting coronal model has significant advantages compared to the pre-existing polytropic alternative, as it models a more realistic bi-modal wind, which is crucial for heliospheric studies. In this study, only thermal conduction, radiative losses, and approximated coronal heating function were considered in the energy equation. A realistic specific heat ratio was applied. The output of the coronal model was used to onset the 3D MHD heliospheric model Icarus. A minimum solar activity case was chosen as the first test case for the full MHD model. The numerically simulated data in the corona and the heliosphere were compared to observational products. We present a first attempt to obtain the full MHD chain from the Sun to Earth with COCONUT and Icarus. The coronal model has been upgraded to a full MHD model for a realistic bi-modal solar wind configuration. The approximated heating functions have modelled the wind reasonably well, but simple approximations are not enough to obtain a realistic density-speed balance or realistic features in the low corona and farther, near the outer boundary. The full MHD model was computed in 1.06 h on 180 cores of the Genius cluster of the Vlaams Supercomputing Center, which is only 1.8 times longer than the polytropic simulation.
#### Puzzle of [Ar II] 7 mcm line broad component of SN 1987A

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the origin of the broad component of the [Ar II] 7 mcm line emission related to the ejecta excitation by the neutron star of SN 1987A. We argue that the line broad wings are emitted at the tmperature of $\sim300$ K. The flux excess in the red wing of [Ar II] line is reproduced by the line photons scattering off the optically thin uniform dust component with the grain size of 1 - 2 mcm and the total mass of $\mbox{(several)}\times10^{-3}\,M{\odot}$. The dusty opaque clumps containing almost all the dust of SN~1987A have a low occultation optical depth and line photon scattering on dusty clumps do not contribute noticeably in the red wing. The additional heating might be related to ionization losses of relativistic protons.

 - **Abstract**
 Surface albedo is an important parameter in radiative transfer simulations of the Earth's system, as it is fundamental to correctly calculate the energy budget of the planet. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites continuously monitor daily and yearly changes in reflection at the planetary surface. The MODIS Surface Reflectance black-sky albedo dataset (MCD43D, version 6.1) gives detailed albedo maps in seven spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared range. These albedo maps allow us to classify different Lambertian surface types and their seasonal and yearly variability and change, albeit only in seven spectral bands. However, a complete set of albedo maps covering the entire wavelength range is required to simulate radiance spectra, and to correctly retrieve atmospheric and cloud properties from Earth's remote sensing. We use a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) regression algorithm to generate hyperspectral albedo maps of Earth. Combining different datasets of hyperspectral reflectance laboratory measurements for various dry soils, vegetation surfaces, and mixtures of both, we reconstruct the albedo maps in the entire wavelength range from 400 to 2500~nm. The PCA method is trained with a 10-years average of MODIS data for each day of the year. We obtain hyperspectral albedo maps with a spatial resolution of 0.05° in latitude and longitude, a spectral resolution of 10~nm, and a temporal resolution of 1~day. Using the hyperspectral albedo maps, we estimate the spectral profiles of different land surfaces, such as forests, deserts, cities and icy surfaces, and study their seasonal variability. These albedo maps shall enable to refine calculations of Earth's energy budget, its seasonal variability, and improve climate simulations.
