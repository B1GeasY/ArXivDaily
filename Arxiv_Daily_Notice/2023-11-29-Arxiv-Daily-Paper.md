#### Properties of the Magellanic Corona Model for the formation of the  Magellanic Stream
 - **Authors:** Scott Lucchini, Elena D'Onghia, Andrew J. Fox
 - **Subjects:** Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16221
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16221
 - **Abstract**
 We characterize the Magellanic Corona model of the formation of the Magellanic Stream, which we introduced in Lucchini et al. (2020, 2021). Using high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations, we constrain the properties of the primordial Magellanic Clouds, including the Magellanic Corona -- the gaseous halo around the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). With an LMC mass of $1.75\times10^{11}$ M$_\odot$, a Magellanic Corona of $>5\times10^9$ M$_\odot$ at $3\times10^5$ K, a total Small Magellanic Cloud mass $<10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, and a Milky Way corona of $2\times10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, we can reproduce the observed total mass of the neutral and ionized components of the Trailing Stream, ionization fractions along the Stream, morphology of the neutral gas, and on-sky extent of the ionized gas. The inclusion of advanced physical routines in the simulations allow the first direct comparison of a hydrodynamical model with UV absorption-line spectroscopic data. Our model reproduces O I, O VI, and C IV observations from HST/COS and FUSE. The stripped material is also nearby ($<50$ kpc from the Sun), as found in our prior models including a Magellanic Corona.
#### Dark Matter Scattering Constraints from Observations of Stars  Surrounding Sgr A*
 - **Authors:** Isabelle John, Rebecca K. Leane, Tim Linden
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)

 - **Abstract**
 High resolution infrared data has revealed several young stars in close proximity to Sgr A*. These stars may encounter extremely high dark matter densities. We examine scenarios where dark matter scatters on stellar gas, accumulates in stellar cores, and then annihilates. We study the stars S2, S62, S4711 and S4714 and find three observable effects. First, dark matter interactions can inhibit in situ star-formation close to Sgr A*, favoring scenarios where these stars migrate into the Galactic Center. Second, dark matter interactions can delay main sequence evolution, making stars older than they appear. Third, very high dark matter densities can inject enough energy to disrupt main sequence stars, allowing S-star observations to constrain the dark matter density near Sgr A*.
#### Spatial Variations of Jovian Tropospheric Ammonia via Ground-Based  Imaging
 - **Authors:** Steven M Hill, Patrick G. J. Irwin, Charlotte Alexander, John H. Rogers
 - **Subjects:** Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16422
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16422
 - **Abstract**
 Optical bandpass-filter observations can be simply processed to determine similar horizontal ammonia distributions above the Jovian cloud tops as mid-infrared and microwave observations. Current understanding of this distribution and its relationship to aerosol opacity, cloud-top pressure, and circulation is provided by atmospheric retrieval models using observations from major ground-based facilities and spacecraft. These techniques recover high fidelity information on the ammonia distribution but are limited in spatial and temporal coverage. Part of this coverage gap - upper tropospheric abundance - can be bridged by using continuum-divided ammonia and methane absorption images as suggested by Combes and Encrenaz [1979]. In 2020-21, Jupiter was imaged in the 645 nm ammonia absorption band and adjacent continuum bands, demonstrating that the spatially-resolved optical depth in that band could be determined with a 0.28-m Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope (SCT). In 2022, a 620 nm filter was added to include methane absorption images in the same wavelength range. Methane abundance provides a constant reference against which to determine the ammonia abundance, specifically the column-averaged mole fraction above the clouds. VLT/MUSE results are compared to these SCT results and those from the TEXES mid-infrared spectrometer used on the IRTF and the Gemini telescopes. Meridional and longitudinal features are examined, including the Equatorial Zone (EZ) ammonia enhancement, the North Equatorial Belt (NEB) depletion, depletion above the Great Red Spot (GRS), and suggested enhancements over bright plumes in the northern EZ. This work demonstrates meaningful ammonia monitoring that can provide synoptic coverage and continuity between spacecraft or major ground-based facility campaigns.
#### Dynamically coupled kinetic chemistry in brown dwarf atmospheres -- II.  Cloud and chemistry connections in directly imaged sub-Jupiter exoplanets
 - **Authors:** Elspeth K.H. Lee, Xianyu Tan, Shang-Min Tsai
 - **Subjects:** Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16722
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16722
 - **Abstract**
 With JWST slated to gain high fidelity time dependent data on brown dwarf atmospheres, it is highly anticipated to do the same for directly imaged, sub-Jupiter exoplanets. With this new capability, the need for a full 3D understanding to explain spectral features and their time dependence is becoming an vital aspect for consideration. To examine the atmospheric properties of directly imaged sub-Jupiter exoplanets, we use the three dimensional Exo-FMS general circulation model (GCM) to simulate a metal enhanced generic young sub-Jupiter object. We couple Exo-FMS to a kinetic chemistry scheme, a tracer based cloud formation scheme and a spectral radiative-transfer model to take into account the chemical and cloud feedback on the atmospheric thermochemical and dynamical properties. Our results show a highly complex feedback between clouds and chemistry onto the 3D temperature structure of the atmosphere, bringing about latitudinal differences and inducing time-dependent stormy features at photospheric pressures. This suggests a strong connection and feedback between the spatial cloud coverage and chemical composition of the atmosphere, with the temperature changes and dynamical motions induced by cloud opacity feedback driving chemical species behaviour. In addition, we also produce latitude dependent and time dependent spectra of our model to investigate atmospheric variability and periodicity in commonly used photometric bands. Overall, our efforts put the included physics in 3D simulations of exoplanets on par with contemporary 1D radiative-convective equilibrium modelling.
