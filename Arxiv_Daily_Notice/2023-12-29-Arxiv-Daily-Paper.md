 - **Abstract**
 We present results from the search for astrometric accelerations of stars in $\omega$ Centauri using 13 years of regularly-scheduled {\it Hubble Space Telescope} WFC3/UVIS calibration observations in the cluster core. The high-precision astrometry of $\sim$160\,000 sources was searched for significant deviations from linear proper motion. This led to the discovery of four cluster members and one foreground field star with compelling acceleration patterns. We interpret them as the result of the gravitational pull by an invisible companion and determined preliminary Keplerian orbit parameters, including the companion's mass. {For the cluster members} our analysis suggests periods ranging from 8.8 to 19+ years and dark companions in the mass range of $\sim$0.7 to $\sim$1.4$M_\mathrm{sun}$. At least one companion could exceed the upper mass-boundary of white dwarfs and can be classified as a neutron-star candidate.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are catastrophic astrophysical phenomena that occur during the last evolutionary stages of massive stars having initial masses of around 8 M$_{\odot}$ or more. These calamitous events play a pivotal role in enriching our Universe with heavy elements and are also responsible for the birth of Neutron stars and stellar mass Black holes. Knowledge of the possible progenitors of CCSNe is fundamental to understanding these transient events. Additionally, the underlying circumstellar environment around possible progenitors and the physical mechanism powering the light curves of these catastrophic CCSN events also require careful investigations to unveil their nature. The research work within the context of the present thesis is an attempt to investigate the possible progenitors, ambient media around the progenitors, and powering mechanisms behind the light curve of CCSNe.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new subgrid model for neutrino quantum kinetics, which is primarily designed to incorporate effects of collective neutrino oscillations into neutrino-radiation-hydrodynamic simulations for core-collapse supernovae and mergers of compact objects. We approximate the neutrino oscillation term in quantum kinetic equation by Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) relaxation-time prescription, and the transport equation is directly applicable for classical neutrino transport schemes. The BGK model is motivated by recent theoretical indications that non-linear phases of collective neutrino oscillations settle into quasi-steady structures. We explicitly provide basic equations of the BGK subgrid model for both multi-angle and moment-based neutrino transport to facilitate the implementation of the subgrid model in the existing neutrino transport schemes. We also show the capability of our BGK subgrid model by comparing to fully quantum kinetic simulations for fast neutrino-flavor conversion. We find that the overall properties can be well reproduced in the subgrid model; the error of angular-averaged survival probability of neutrinos is within $\sim 20 \%$. By identifying the source of error, we also discuss perspectives to improve the accuracy of the subgrid model.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar detection has become an active research topic in radio astronomy recently. One of the essential procedures for pulsar detection is pulsar candidate sifting (PCS), a procedure of finding out the potential pulsar signals in a survey. However, pulsar candidates are always class-imbalanced, as most candidates are non-pulsars such as RFI and only a tiny part of them are from real pulsars. Class imbalance has greatly damaged the performance of machine learning (ML) models, resulting in a heavy cost as some real pulsars are misjudged. To deal with the problem, techniques of choosing relevant features to discriminate pulsars from non-pulsars are focused on, which is known as {\itshape feature selection}. Feature selection is a process of selecting a subset of the most relevant features from a feature pool. The distinguishing features between pulsars and non-pulsars can significantly improve the performance of the classifier even if the data are highly imbalanced.In this work, an algorithm of feature selection called {\itshape K-fold Relief-Greedy} algorithm (KFRG) is designed. KFRG is a two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, it filters out some irrelevant features according to their K-fold Relief scores, while in the second stage, it removes the redundant features and selects the most relevant features by a forward greedy search strategy. Experiments on the dataset of the High Time Resolution Universe survey verified that ML models based on KFRG are capable for PCS, correctly separating pulsars from non-pulsars even if the candidates are highly class-imbalanced.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiation flow through an inhomogeneous medium is critical in a wide range of physics and astronomy applications from transport across cloud layers on the earth to the propagation of supernova blast-waves producing UV and X-ray emission in supernovae. This paper reviews the current state of the art in the modeling of inhomogeneous radiation transport, subgrid models developed to capture this often-unresolved physics, and the experiments designed to improve our understanding of these models. We present a series of detailed simulations (both single-clump and multi-clump conditions) probing the dependence on the physical properties of the radiation front (e.g. radiation energy) and material characteristics (specific heat, opacity, clump densities). Unless the radiation pressure is high, the clumps will heat and then expand, effectively cutting off the radiation flow. The expanding winds can also produce shocks that generates high energy emission. We compare our detailed simulations with some of the current subgrid prescriptions, identifying some of the limitations of these current models.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the commencement of the first SETI observation in 2019, China's Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence program has garnered momentum through domestic support and international collaborations. Several observations targeting exoplanets and nearby stars have been conducted with the FAST. In 2023, the introduction of the Far Neighbour Project(FNP) marks a substantial leap forward, driven by the remarkable sensitivity of the FAST telescope and some of the novel observational techniques. The FNP seeks to methodically detect technosignatures from celestial bodies, including nearby stars, exoplanetary systems, Milky Way globular clusters, and more. This paper provides an overview of the progress achieved by SETI in China and offers insights into the distinct phases comprising the FNP. Additionally, it underscores the significance of this project's advancement and its potential contributions to the field.

 - **Abstract**
 We present three-dimensional (3D) maps of Jupiter's atmospheric circulation at cloud-top level from Doppler-imaging data obtained in the visible domain with JIVE, the second node of the JOVIAL network, which is mounted on the Dunn Solar Telescope at Sunspot, New Mexico. We report on 12 nights of observations between May 4 and May 30, 2018, representing a total of about 80 hours. Firstly, the average zonal wind profile derived from our data is compatible with that derived from cloud-tracking measurements performed on Hubble Space Telescope images obtained in April 2018 from the Outer Planet Atmospheres Legacy (OPAL) program. Secondly, we present the first ever two-dimensional maps of Jupiter's atmospheric circulation from Doppler measurements. The zonal velocity map highlights well-known atmospheric features, such as the equatorial hot spots and the Great Red Spot (GRS). In addition to zonal winds, we derive meridional and vertical velocity fields from the Doppler data. The motions attributed to vertical flows are mainly located at the boundary between the equatorial belts and tropical zones, which could indicate active motion in theses regions. Qualitatively, these results compare well to recent Juno data that have unveiled the three-dimensional structure of Jupiter's wind field. To the contrary, the motions attributed to meridional circulation are very different from what is obtained by cloud tracking, except at the GRS. Because of limitations with data resolution and processing techniques, we acknowledge that our measurement of vertical or meridional flows of Jupiter are still to be confirmed.

 - **Abstract**
 Novae, explosive events in binary star systems involving a white dwarf and a companion star, offer profound insights into extreme astrophysical conditions. During the eruption of a nova, material accreted onto the white dwarf's surface undergoes a thermonuclear runaway reaction resulting in the ejection of matter into space and the formation of a luminous shell. The classical V5668 Sgr (Nova Sagittarii) was the second and brighter of the two novae in the southern constellation of Sagittarius. It was discovered by John Seach of Chatsworth Island, Australia, on March 15, 2015. In this paper, drawing on data from Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, the US-based radio astronomy observatory, on V5668 Sgr as well as from research that aggregates data from a range of sources including telescope archives, this study used the Uniform Slab Model and statistical techniques to plot the nova's light and frequency curves and estimate its ejected shell mass and the brightness temperature. These characteristics help us better understand the nova's formation and eruption. The paper presents the light curves in a machine-readable format and provides insight into the behaviour of ionised gas clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 Young transiting exoplanets offer a unique opportunity to characterize the atmospheres of fresh and evolving products of planet formation. We present the transmission spectrum of V1298 Tau b; a 23 Myr old warm Jovian sized planet orbiting a pre-main sequence star. We detect a primordial atmosphere with an exceptionally large atmospheric scale height and a water vapour absorption at 5$\sigma$ level of significance. We estimate a mass and density upper limit (24$\pm$5$M_{\oplus}$, 0.12gm/$cm^{3}$ respectively). V1298 Tau b is one of the lowest density planets discovered till date. We retrieve a low atmospheric metallicity (logZ=$-0.1^{+0.66}_{-0.72}$ solar), consistent with solar/sub-solar values. Our findings challenge the expected mass-metallicity from core-accretion theory. Our observations can be explained by in-situ formation via pebble accretion together with ongoing evolutionary mechanisms. We do not detect methane, which hints towards a hotter than expected interior from just the formation entropy of this planet. Our observations suggest that V1298 Tau b is likely to evolve into a Neptune/sub-Neptune type of planet.

 - **Abstract**
 Modal noise appears due to the non-uniform and unstable distribution of light intensity among the finite number of modes in multimode fibres. It is an important limiting factor in measuring radial velocity precisely by fibre-fed high-resolution spectrographs. The problem can become particularly severe as the fibre's core become smaller and the number of modes that can propagate reduces. Thus, mitigating modal noise in relatively small core fibres still remains a challenge. We present here a novel technique to suppress modal noise. Two movable mirrors in the form of a galvanometer reimage the mode-pattern of an input fibre to an output fibre. The mixing of modes coupled to the output fibre can be controlled by the movement of mirrors applying two sinusoidal signals through a voltage generator. We test the technique for four multimode circular fibres: 10 and 50 micron step-index, 50 micron graded-index, and a combination of 50 micron graded-index and 5:1 tapered fibres (GI50t). We present the results of mode suppression both in terms of the direct image of the output fibre and spectrum of white light obtained with the high-resolution spectrograph. We found that the galvanometer mitigated modal noise in all the tested fibres, but was most useful for smaller core fibres. However, there is a trade-off between the modal noise reduction and light-loss. The GI50t provides the best result with about 60% mitigation of modal noise at a cost of about 5% output light-loss. Our solution is easy to use and can be implemented in fibre-fed spectrographs.
