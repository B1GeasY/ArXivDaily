 - **Abstract**
 Automating real-time anomaly detection is essential for identifying rare transients in the era of large-scale astronomical surveys. Modern survey telescopes are generating tens of thousands of alerts per night, and future telescopes, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, are projected to increase this number dramatically. Currently, most anomaly detection algorithms for astronomical transients rely either on hand-crafted features extracted from light curves or on features generated through unsupervised representation learning, which are then coupled with standard machine learning anomaly detection algorithms. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach to detecting anomalies: using the penultimate layer of a neural network classifier as the latent space for anomaly detection. We then propose a novel method, named Multi-Class Isolation Forests (MCIF), which trains separate isolation forests for each class to derive an anomaly score for a light curve from the latent space representation given by the classifier. This approach significantly outperforms a standard isolation forest. We also use a simpler input method for real-time transient classifiers which circumvents the need for interpolation in light curves and helps the neural network model inter-passband relationships and handle irregular sampling. Our anomaly detection pipeline identifies rare classes including kilonovae, pair-instability supernovae, and intermediate luminosity transients shortly after trigger on simulated Zwicky Transient Facility light curves. Using a sample of our simulations that matched the population of anomalies expected in nature (54 anomalies and 12,040 common transients), our method was able to discover $41\pm3$ anomalies (~75% recall) after following up the top 2000 (~15%) ranked transients. Our novel method shows that classifiers can be effectively repurposed for real-time anomaly detection.

 - **Abstract**
 The circumgalactic medium (CGM) contains information on the cumulative effect of galactic outflows over time, generally thought to be caused by feedback from star formation and active galactic nuclei. Observations of such outflows via absorption in CGM gas of quasar sightlines show a significant amount of cold ($\lesssim 10^4 \; \rm{K}$) gas which cosmological simulations struggle to reproduce. Here, we use the adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamical code RAMSES to investigate the effect of cosmic rays (CR) on the cold gas content of the CGM using three zoom realizations of a $z=1$ star-forming galaxy with supernova mechanical feedback: one with no CR feedback (referred to as no-CR), one with a medium CR diffusion coefficient $\kappa = 10^{28} \; \rm{cm^{2}\; s^{-1}}$ (CR$-\kappa_{\rm med}$), and one with a high rate of diffusion of $\kappa = 3\times10^{29} \; \rm{cm^{2}\; s^{-1}}$ (CR$-\kappa_{\rm high}$). We find that, for CR$-\kappa_{\rm med}$, the effects of CRs are largely confined to the galaxy itself as CRs do not extend far into the CGM. However, for CR$-\kappa_{\rm high}$, the CGM temperature is lowered and the amount of outflowing gas is boosted. Our CR simulations fall short of the observed Mg II covering fraction, a tracer of gas at temperatures $\lesssim 10^4 \; \rm{K}$, but the CR$-\kappa_{\rm high}$ simulation is more in agreement with covering fractions of C IV and O VI, which trace higher temperature gas.

 - **Abstract**
 We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Integral Field Spectrograph observations of NGC 3256, a local infrared-luminous late-stage merging system with two nuclei about 1 kpc apart, both of which have evidence of cold molecular outflows. Using JWST NIRSpec and MIRI datasets, we investigate this morphologically complex system on spatial scales of $<$100 pc, where we focus on the warm molecular H$_2$ gas surrounding the nuclei. We detect collimated outflowing warm H$_2$ gas originating from the southern nucleus, though we do not find significant outflowing warm H$_2$ gas surrounding the northern nucleus. Within the observed region, the maximum intrinsic velocities of the outflow reach up to $\sim$1,000 km s$^{-1}$, and extend out to a distance of 0.7 kpc. Based on H$_2$ S(7)/S(1) line ratios, we find a larger fraction of warmer gas near the S nucleus, which decreases with increasing distance from the nucleus, signifying the S nucleus as a primary source of H$_2$ heating. The gas mass of the warm H$_2$ outflow component is estimated to be $M\rm{_{warm,out}}$ = 8.9$\times$10$^5\;M_{\odot}$, as much as 4$\%$ of the cold H$_2$ mass as estimated using ALMA CO data. The outflow time scale is about $7\times10^5$ yr, resulting in a mass outflow rate of $\dot{M}\rm{_{warm,out}}$ = 1.3 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and kinetic power of $P\rm{_{warm,out}}\;\sim\;2\times10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Lastly, the regions where the outflowing gas reside show high [FeII]/Pa$\beta$ and H$_2$/Br$\gamma$ line ratios, indicating enhanced mechanical heating caused by the outflows. At the same time, the 3.3 $\mu$m and 6.2 $\mu$m Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon fluxes in these regions are not significantly suppressed compared to those outside the outflows, suggesting the outflows have no clear negative feedback effect on the local star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We build on the simplified spectral deferred corrections (SDC) coupling of hydrodynamics and reactions to handle the case of nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE) and electron/positron captures/decays in the cores of massive stars. Our approach blends a traditional reaction network on the grid with a tabulated NSE state from a very large, $\mathcal{O}(100)$ nuclei, network. We demonstrate how to achieve second-order accuracy in the simplified-SDC framework when coupling NSE to hydrodynamics, with the ability to evolve the star on the hydrodynamics timestep. We discuss the application of this method to convection in massive stars leading up to core-collapse. We also show how to initialize the initial convective state from a 1D model in a self-consistent fashion. All of these developments are done in the publicly available Castro simulation code and the entire simulation methodology is fully GPU accelerated.
#### Phase-resolved XMM-Newton observations of the massive post-RLOF system  HD 149404

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the X-ray emission of HD 149404, a 9.81-day period O-star binary in a post-Roche lobe overflow evolutionary stage. X-ray emission of O-star binaries consists of the intrinsic emission of the individual O stars and a putative additional component arising from the wind-wind interaction. Phase-locked variations in the X-ray spectra can be used to probe the properties of the stellar winds of such systems. XMM-Newton observations of HD 149404 collected at two conjunction phases and a quadrature phase were analysed. X-ray spectra were extracted and flux variations as a function of orbital phase were inferred. The flux ratios were analysed with models considering various origins for the X-ray emission. The highest and lowest X-ray fluxes are observed at conjunction phases respectively with the primary and secondary star in front. The flux variations are nearly grey with only marginal energy dependence. None of the models accounting for photoelectric absorption by homogeneous stellar winds perfectly reproduces the observed variations. Whilst the overall X-ray luminosity is consistent with a pure intrinsic emission, the best formal agreement with the observed variations is obtained with a model assuming pure wind-wind collision X-ray emission. The lack of significant energy-dependence of the opacity most likely hints at the presence of optically thick clumps in the winds of HD 149404.
#### Does the Redshift Distribution of Swift Long GRBs Trace the  Star-Formation Rate?

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are extremely powerful explosions that have been traditionally classified into two categories: long bursts (LGRBs) with an observed duration T90 > 2 s, and short bursts (SGRBs) with an observed duration T90 < 2 s, where T90 is the time interval during which 90% of the fluence is detected. LGRBs are believed to emanate from the core-collapse of massive stars, while SGRBs are believed to result from the merging of two compact objects, like two neutron stars. Because LGRBs are produced by the violent death of massive stars, we expect that their redshift distribution should trace the star-formation rate (SFR). The purpose of our study is to investigate the extent to which the redshift distribution of LGRBs follows and reflects the SFR. We use a sample of 370 LGRBs taken from the Swift catalog, and we investigate different models for the LGRB redshift distribution. We also carry out Monte Carlo simulations to check the consistency of our results. Our results indicate that the SFR can describe the LGRB redshift distribution well for high redshift bursts, but it needs an evolution term to fit the distribution well at low redshift.
#### Galaxy merger challenge: A comparison study between machine  learning-based detection methods

 - **Abstract**
 Various galaxy merger detection methods have been applied to diverse datasets. However, it is difficult to understand how they compare. We aim to benchmark the relative performance of machine learning (ML) merger detection methods. We explore six leading ML methods using three main datasets. The first one (the training data) consists of mock observations from the IllustrisTNG simulations and allows us to quantify the performance metrics of the detection methods. The second one consists of mock observations from the Horizon-AGN simulations, introduced to evaluate the performance of classifiers trained on different, but comparable data. The third one consists of real observations from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) survey. For the binary classification task (mergers vs. non-mergers), all methods perform reasonably well in the domain of the training data. At $0.1<z<0.3$, precision and recall range between $\sim$70\% and 80\%, both of which decrease with increasing $z$ as expected (by $\sim$5\% for precision and $\sim$10\% for recall at $0.76<z<1.0$). When transferred to a different domain, the precision of all classifiers is only slightly reduced, but the recall is significantly worse (by $\sim$20-40\% depending on the method). Zoobot offers the best overall performance in terms of precision and F1 score. When applied to real HSC observations, all methods agree well with visual labels of clear mergers but can differ by more than an order of magnitude in predicting the overall fraction of major mergers. For the multi-class classification task to distinguish pre-, post- and non-mergers, none of the methods offer a good performance, which could be partly due to limitations in resolution and depth of the data. With the advent of better quality data (e.g. JWST and Euclid), it is important to improve our ability to detect mergers and distinguish between merger stages.
#### Gravitational Waves from Collapse of Pressureless Matter in the Early  Universe

 - **Abstract**
 If an early matter phase of the Universe existed after inflation with the proper power spectrum, enhanced density perturbations can decouple from the Hubble flow, turn around and collapse. In contrast to what happens in a radiation dominated Universe where pressure nullifies deviations from sphericity in these perturbations, in a matter dominated Universe, the lack of pressure although on the one hand facilitates the gravitational collapse, it allows small deviations from sphericity to grow substantially as the collapse takes place. The subsequent collapse is complicated: initially as non-spherical deviations grow, the collapsing cloud takes the form of a ``Zel'dovich pancake". After that, the more chaotic and nonlinear stage of violent relaxation begins where shells of the cloud cross and the matter is redistributed within a factor of a few of the free fall timescale, reaching a spherical virialized state. During the whole process, strong gravitational waves are emitted due to the anisotropy of the collapse and the small time interval that the effect takes place. The emission of gravitational waves during the stage of the violent relaxation cannot be easily estimated with an analytical model. We perform an $N$-body simulation to capture the behaviour of matter during this stage in order to estimate the precise spectrum of gravitational waves produced in this scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 This research investigates the impact of the nature of Dark Energy (DE) on structure formation, focusing on the matter power spectrum and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW). By analyzing the matter power spectrum at redshifts $z = 0$ and $z = 5$, as well as the ISW effect on the scale of $\ell = 10-100$, the study provides valuable insights into the influence of DE equations of state (EoS) on structure formation. The findings reveal that dynamical DE models exhibit a stronger matter power spectrum compared to constant DE models, with the JBP model demonstrating the highest amplitude and the CPL model the weakest. Additionally, the study delves into the ISW effect, highlighting the time evolution of the ISW source term $\mathcal{F}(a)$ and its derivative $d\mathcal{F}(a)/da$, and demonstrating that models with constant DE EoS exhibit a stronger amplitude of $\mathcal{F}(a)$ overall, while dynamical models such as CPL exhibit the highest amplitude among the dynamical models, whereas JBP has the lowest. The study also explores the ISW auto-correlation power spectrum and the ISW cross-correlation power spectrum, revealing that dynamical DE models dominate over those with constant DE EoS across various surveys. Moreover, it emphasizes the potential of studying the non-linear matter power spectrum and incorporating datasets from the small scales to further elucidate the dynamical nature of dark energy. This comprehensive analysis underscores the significance of both the matter power spectrum and the ISW signal in discerning the nature of dark energy, paving the way for future research to explore the matter power spectrum at higher redshifts and in the non-linear regime, providing deeper insights into the dynamical nature of dark energy.
#### The Dissolution of Planetesimals in Electrostatic Fields

 - **Abstract**
 Planetesimals or smaller bodies in protoplanetary disks are often considered to form as pebble piles in current planet formation models. They are supposed to be large but loose, weakly bound clusters of more robust dust aggregates. This makes them easy prey for destructive processes. In microgravity experiments, we apply strong electric fields on clusters of slightly conductive dust aggregates. We find that this generates enough tensile stress on the fragile clusters to sequentially rip off the aggregates from the cluster. These experiments imply that electric fields in protoplanetary disks can dissolve pebble pile planetesimals. This process might induce a bias for the local planetesimal reservoir in regions with strong fields. Planetesimals prevail with certain kinds of compositions where they are either good isolators or compacted bodies. The less lucky ones generate pebble clouds which might be observable as signposts of electrostatic activity in protoplanetary disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting axionic dark matter (DM) could be possible in an X-ray spectrum from strongly magnetized neutron stars (NSs). We examine the possibility of axion-photon conversion in the magnetospheres of strongly magnetized NSs. In the current work, we investigate how the modified Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff (TOV) system of equations (in the presence of a magnetic field) affects the energy spectrum of axions and axions-converted photon flux. We have considered the distance-dependent magnetic field in the modified TOV equations. We employ three different equations of states (EoSs) to solve these equations. We obtain the axions emission rate by including the Cooper-pair-breaking formation process (PBF) and Bremsstrahlung process in the core of NSs using the NSCool code. We primarily focus on three NSs: PSR B0531+21, PSR J0538+2817, and one Magnificient seven (M7) star RXJ 1856.5-3754. We further investigate the impact of the magnetic field on the actual observables, such as axion`s energy spectrum and axion-photon flux. We also compare our calculated axion-photon flux from all available archival data from PN+MOS+Chandra. Our predicted axion-photon flux values as a function of axion`s energy closely follow the experimentally archival data, which allows us to put bounds on the axion`s mass for the three different EoS.13
#### Simulation of radio signals from cosmic-ray cascades in air and ice as  observed by in-ice Askaryan radio detectors

 - **Abstract**
 A new generation of neutrino observatories, including RNO-G and RET, will search for PeV-EeV neutrinos interacting in the ice by detecting radio pulses. Extended air showers propagating into the ice will form an important background and could be a valuable calibration signal. We present results from a Monte-Carlo simulation framework developed to fully simulate radio emission from cosmic-ray particle cascades as observed by in-ice radio detectors in the polar regions. The framework involves a modified version of CoREAS (a module of CORSIKA 7) to simulate in-air radio emission and a GEANT4-based framework for simulating in-ice radio emission from cosmic-ray showers as observed by in-ice antennas. The particles that reach the surface of the polar ice sheet at the end of the CORSIKA 7 simulation are injected into the GEANT4-based shower simulation code that takes the particles and propagates them further into the ice sheet, using an exponential density profile for the ice. The framework takes into account curved ray paths caused by the exponential refractive index profiles of air and ice. We present the framework and discuss some key features of the radio signal and radio shower footprint for in-ice observers.
