 - **Abstract**
 The second generation of the Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon (EUSO-SPB2) is a balloon instrument that searched for ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) with energies above 1 EeV and very high energy neutrinos with energies above 1 PeV. EUSO-SPB2 consists of two telescopes: a fluorescence telescope pointed downward for the detection of UHECRs and a Cherenkov telescope toward the limb for the detection of PeV-scale showers produced by neutrino-sourced tau decay (just below the limb) and by cosmic rays (just above the limb). Clouds inside the fields of view of these telescopes--particularly that of the fluorescence telescope--reduce EUSO-SPB2's geometric aperture. As such, cloud coverage and cloud-top altitude within the field of view of the fluorescence telescope must be monitored throughout data-taking. The University of Chicago Infrared Camera (UCIRC2) monitored these clouds using two infrared cameras centered at 10 and 12 $\mu$m. By capturing images at wavelengths spanning the cloud thermal emission peak, UCIRC2 measured cloud color-temperatures and thus cloud-top altitudes. In this contribution, we provide an overview of UCIRC2, including an update on its construction and performance. We also show first results from the flight.

 - **Abstract**
 Clouds are prevalent in many of the exoplanet atmospheres that have been observed to date. For transiting exoplanets, we know if clouds are present because they mute spectral features and cause wavelength-dependent scattering. While the exact composition of these clouds is largely unknown, this information is vital to understanding the chemistry and energy budget of planetary atmospheres. In this work, we observe one transit of the hot Jupiter WASP-17b with JWST's MIRI LRS and generate a transmission spectrum from 5-12 $\rm{\mu}$m. These wavelengths allow us to probe absorption due to the vibrational modes of various predicted cloud species. Our transmission spectrum shows additional opacity centered at 8.6 $\rm{\mu}$m, and detailed atmospheric modeling and retrievals identify this feature as SiO$_2$(s) (quartz) clouds. The SiO$_2$(s) clouds model is preferred at 3.5-4.2$\sigma$ versus a cloud-free model and at 2.6$\sigma$ versus a generic aerosol prescription. We find the SiO$_2$(s) clouds are comprised of small ${\sim}0.01$ $\rm{\mu}$m particles, which extend to high altitudes in the atmosphere. The atmosphere also shows a depletion of H$_2$O, a finding consistent with the formation of high-temperature aerosols from oxygen-rich species. This work is part of a series of studies by our JWST Telescope Scientist Team (JWST-TST), in which we will use Guaranteed Time Observations to perform Deep Reconnaissance of Exoplanet Atmospheres through Multi-instrument Spectroscopy (DREAMS).

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) We investigate the impact of radiative feedback from massive stars on their natal cloud and focus on the transition from the HII region to the atomic PDR (crossing the ionisation front (IF)), and the subsequent transition to the molecular PDR (crossing the dissociation front (DF)). We use high-resolution near-IR integral field spectroscopic data from NIRSpec on JWST to observe the Orion Bar PDR as part of the PDRs4All JWST Early Release Science Program. The NIRSpec data reveal a forest of lines including, but not limited to, HeI, HI, and CI recombination lines, ionic lines, OI and NI fluorescence lines, Aromatic Infrared Bands (AIBs including aromatic CH, aliphatic CH, and their CD counterparts), CO2 ice, pure rotational and ro-vibrational lines from H2, and ro-vibrational lines HD, CO, and CH+, most of them detected for the first time towards a PDR. Their spatial distribution resolves the H and He ionisation structure in the Huygens region, gives insight into the geometry of the Bar, and confirms the large-scale stratification of PDRs. We observe numerous smaller scale structures whose typical size decreases with distance from Ori C and IR lines from CI, if solely arising from radiative recombination and cascade, reveal very high gas temperatures consistent with the hot irradiated surface of small-scale dense clumps deep inside the PDR. The H2 lines reveal multiple, prominent filaments which exhibit different characteristics. This leaves the impression of a "terraced" transition from the predominantly atomic surface region to the CO-rich molecular zone deeper in. This study showcases the discovery space created by JWST to further our understanding of the impact radiation from young stars has on their natal molecular cloud and proto-planetary disk, which touches on star- and planet formation as well as galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the confirmation of a hot super-Neptune with an exterior Neptune companion orbiting a bright (V = 10.1 mag) F-dwarf identified by the $\textit{Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite}$ ($\textit{TESS}$). The two planets, observed in sectors 45, 46 and 48 of the $\textit{TESS}$ extended mission, are $4.74^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$ $R_{\oplus}$ and $3.86^{+0.17}_{-0.16}$ $R_{\oplus}$ with $5.4588385^{+0.0000070}_{-0.0000072}$ d and $17.8999^{+0.0018}_{-0.0013}$ d orbital periods, respectively. We also obtained precise space based photometric follow-up of the system with ESAs $\textit{CHaracterising ExOplanets Satellite}$ ($\textit{CHEOPS}$) to constrain the radius and ephemeris of TOI-5126 b. TOI 5126 b is located in the "hot Neptune Desert" and is an ideal candidate for follow-up transmission spectroscopy due to its high predicted equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq} = 1442^{+46}_{-40}$ K) implying a cloud-free atmosphere. TOI-5126 c is a warm Neptune ($T_{eq}= 971^{+31}_{-27}$ K) also suitable for follow-up. Tentative transit timing variations (TTVs) have also been identified in analysis, suggesting the presence of at least one additional planet, however this signal may be caused by spot-crossing events, necessitating further precise photometric follow-up to confirm these signals.
#### Detection of a ~ 0.1c radio knot in M81* associated with a moderate  X-ray flare

 - **Abstract**
 Through very long baseline interferometry observations of one of the closest low-luminosity active galactic nuclei M81* at multifrequencies of 8.8, 22 and 44GHz, a bright discrete knot with an unusual low apparent speed $\sim$0.1c was detected. Combining with the contemporary monitoring of X-rays data at 2-10keV, it indicates that a moderate X-ray flare happened when the knot launched from the core region. Three possible origins of the knot are proposed to explain our observational results. They are an episodic jet ejection, a low-speed shock wave, and a possible secondary black hole in a binary system, respectively. Future intensive multiwavelength monitoring can help to understand the discrete knot as well as the central black hole better.
#### Robust r-process Nucleosynthesis Beyond Lanthanides in the Common  Envelop Jet Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 The common envelop jet supernovae (CEJSN) r-process scenario has been proposed as an r-process nucleosynthesis site in the past decade. Jets launched by a neutron star that spirals-in inside the core of a red supergiant star in a common envelope evolution supply the proper conditions for the formation of elements heavier than iron through the rapid neutron capture process. The present work initially unveils the r-process abundance patterns that result from the density profile in the relatively long-lived jets. The results indicate that the CEJSN r-process scenario can produce the largest ratio of the third r-process peak elements to Lanthanides among current r-process scenarios, and in addition can form quite an amount of Lanthanides in a single event. The comparison of the ratio of the third peak elements to the Lanthanides with a number of observed r-enhanced metal-poor stars and with other r-process scenarios suggests that a high mass of third peak elements is anti-correlated with high fraction of Lanthanides, both in observations and theory. The CEJSN r-process scenario plays a significant role in this conclusion, since it reproduces the observational features of some particular r-enhanced metal-poor stars where other r-process scenarios encounter problems. Due to the formation of extremely heavy elements, the CEJSN also offers a credible estimation on the age of the most Actinide boosted star by cosmochronometry.
#### Extended far-UV emission surrounding asymptotic giant branch stars as  seen by GALEX

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. Our goal is to study the long-term mass-loss rate characteristics of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars through wind-wind and wind-interstellar medium interaction. Methods. Far-ultraviolet (FUV) images from the Galex survey are used to investigate extended UV emission associated with AGB stars. Results. FUV emission was found towards eight objects. The emission displays different shapes and sizes; interaction regions were identified, often with infrared counterparts, but no equivalent near-ultraviolet (NUV) emission was found in most cases. Conclusions. The FUV emission is likely attributed to shock-excited molecular hydrogen, considering the lack of NUV emission and the large space velocities of the objects, and makes it possible to trace old structures that are too faint to be observed, for instance, in the infrared.
#### Aluminium-26 production in low- and intermediate-mass binary systems

 - **Abstract**
 Aluminium-26 is a radioactive isotope which can be synthesized within asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, primarily through hot bottom burning. Studies exploring $^{26}$Al production within AGB stars typically focus on single-stars; however, observations show that low- and intermediate-mass stars commonly exist in binaries. We use the binary population synthesis code binary_c to explore the impact of binary evolution on $^{26}$Al yields at solar metallicity both within individual AGB stars and a low/intermediate-mass stellar population. We find the key stellar structural condition achieving most $^{26}$Al overproduction is for stars to enter the thermally-pulsing AGB (TP-AGB) phase with small cores relative to their total masses, allowing those stars to spend abnormally long times on the TP-AGB compared to single-stars of identical mass. Our population with a binary fraction of 0.75 has an $^{26}$Al weighted population yield increase of $25\%$ compared to our population of only single-stars. Stellar-models calculated from the Mt Stromlo/Monash Stellar Structure Program, which we use to test our results from binary_c and closely examine the interior structure of the overproducing stars, support our binary_c results only when the stellar envelope gains mass after core-He depletion. Stars which gain mass before core-He depletion still overproduce $^{26}$Al, but to a lesser extent. This introduces some physical uncertainty into our conclusions as $55\%$ of our $^{26}$Al overproducing stars gain envelope mass through stellar wind accretion onto pre-AGB objects. Our work highlights the need to consider binary influence on the production of $^{26}$Al.
#### Early phases of star formation: testing chemical tools

 - **Abstract**
 The star forming processes strongly influence the ISM chemistry. Nowadays, there are available many high-quality databases at millimeter wavelengths. Using them, it is possible to carry out studies that review and deepen previous results. If these studies involve large samples of sources, it is preferred to use direct tools to study the molecular gas. With the aim of testing these tools such as the use of the HCN/HNC ratio as a thermometer, and the use of H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$, HC$_{3}$N, N$_{2}$H$^{+}$, and C$_{2}$H as "chemical clocks", we present a molecular line study towards 55 sources representing massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) at different evolutive stages: infrared dark clouds (IRDCs), high-mass protostellar objects (HMPOs), hot molecular cores (HMCs) and ultracompact HII regions (UCHII). We found that the use of HCN/HNC ratio as an universal thermometer in the ISM should be taken with care because the HCN optical depth is a big issue that can affect the method. Hence, this tool should be used only after a careful analysis of the HCN spectrum, checking that no line, neither the main nor the hyperfine ones, present absorption features. We point out that the analysis of the emission of H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$, HC$_{3}$N, N$_{2}$H$^{+}$, and C$_{2}$H could be useful to trace and distinguish regions among IRDCs, HMPOs and HMCs. The molecular line widths of these four species increase from the IRDC to the HMC stage, which can be a consequence of the gas dynamics related to the star-forming processes taking place in the molecular clumps. Our results do not only contribute with more statistics regarding to probe such chemical tools, useful to obtain information in large samples of sources, but also complement previous works through the analysis on other types of sources.
