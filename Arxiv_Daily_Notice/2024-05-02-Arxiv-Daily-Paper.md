 - **Abstract**
 It is assumed that heavy dark matter $\phi$ with O(TeV) mass captured by the Earth may decay to relativistic light milli-charged particles (MCPs). These MCPs could be measured by the IceCube neutrino telescope. The massless hidden photon model was taken for MCPs to interact with nuclei, so that the numbers and fluxes of expected MCPs may be evaluated at IceCube. Meanwhile, the numbers of expected neutrino background events were also evaluated at IceCube. Based on the assumption that no events are observed at IceCube in 10 years, the corresponding upper limits on MCP fluxes were calculated at 90\% C. L.. These results indicated that the MCPs from the Earth's core could be directly detected at O(1TeV) energies at IceCube when $2\times10^{-5}\lesssim\epsilon^2\lesssim4.5\times10^{-3}$. And a new region of 100 MeV < $m_{MCP}$ < 10 GeV and $4.47\times10^{-3}$ $\lesssim$ $\epsilon$ $\lesssim$ $9.41\times10^{-2}$ is ruled out in the $m_{MCP}$-$\epsilon$ plane with 10 years of IceCube data.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the Bower-Liang model, we discuss how pressure anisotropies affect the microscopic and macroscopic properties of hybrid stars. We find that anisotropies affect the maximum mass, central density, and radius of the canonical stars. Anisotropies also affect the minimum neutron star mass that presents quarks in their core, as well as the total amount of quarks for the maximally massive stars. We also confront our results with standard constraints, such as the radius and the tidal parameter of the canonical star, as well as the mass and radius of the PSR J0740+6620 pulsar. We observe that moderate values for anisotropies could fulfill these constraints simultaneously. On the other hand, within more extreme degrees of anisotropies, more speculative constraints such as black widow pulsars PSR J0952-0607 and the mass-gap object in the GW190814 event can be explained as hybrid stars. We also investigate the role of anisotropies in the neutron stars' moment of inertia.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation estimates based on the counting of YSOs is commonly applied to nearby star-forming regions in the Galaxy. With this method, the SFRs are measured using the counts of YSOs in a particular protostellar Class, a typical protostellar mass, and the lifetime associated with this Class. However, the assumptions underlying the validity of the method such as that of a constant star formation history (SFH) and whether the method is valid for all protostellar Classes has never been fully tested. In this work, we use Monte Carlo models to test the validity of the method. We build synthetic clusters in which stars form at times that are randomly drawn from a specified SFH. The latter is either constant or time-dependent with a burst like behavior. The masses of the protostars are randomly drawn from an IMF which can be either similar to that of the Milky Way field or be variable . For each star in every cluster, the lifetimes associated with the different protostellar classes are also randomly drawn from Gaussian distribution functions centered around their most likely value as suggested by the observations. We find that only the SFR derived using the Class 0 population can reproduce the true SFR at all epochs, and this is true irrespective of the shape of the SFH. For a constant SFH, the SFR derived using the more evolved populations of protostars (Classes I, F, II, and III) reproduce the real SFR only at later epochs which correspond to epochs at which their numbers have reached a steady state. For a time-dependent burst-like SFH, all SFR estimates based on the number counts of the evolved populations fail to reproduce the true SFR. We also show how the offsets between Class I and Class II based SFRs and the true SFR plotted as a function of the number ratios of Class I and Class II versus Class III YSOs can be used in order to constrain the SFH of observed molecular clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 The most metal-poor stars provide valuable insights into the early chemical enrichment history of a system, carrying the chemical imprints of the first generations of supernovae. The most metal-poor region of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy remains inadequately observed and characterised. To date, only a handful of stars with [Fe/H]$<-2.0$ have been chemically analysed with high-resolution spectroscopy. In this study, we present the most extensive chemical abundance analysis of 12 low-metallicity stars with metallicities down to [Fe/H]$=-3.26$ and located in the main body of Sagittarius. These targets, selected from the Pristine Inner Galaxy survey, were observed using the MIKE high-resolution spectrograph at the Magellan-Clay telescope, which allows us to measure up to 17 chemical species. The chemical composition of these stars reflects the imprint of a variety of type~II supernovae. A combination of low- to intermediate-mass core-collapse and hypernovae ($\sim10-70 M_{\odot}$) is required to account for the abundance patterns of the lighter elements up to the Fe-peak. The trend of the heavy elements suggests the involvement of compact binary merger events and fast-rotating (up to $\sim300$ km s$^{-1}$) intermediate-mass to massive metal-poor stars ($\sim25-120 M_{\odot}$) that are the sources of rapid- and slow-processes, respectively. Additionally, asymptotic giant branch stars contribute to a wide dispersion of [Ba/Mg] and [Ba/Eu]. The absence of an $\alpha-$knee in our data indicates that type Ia supernovae did not contribute in the very metal-poor region ( [Fe/H]$\leq-2.0$). However, they might have started to pollute the interstellar medium at [Fe/H]$>-2.0$, given the relatively low [Co/Fe] in this metallicity region.
#### Gas, not dust: Migration of TESS/Gaia hot Jupiters possibly halted by  the magnetospheres of protoplanetary disks

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) The presence of short-period (< 10 days) planets around main sequence (MS) stars has been associated either with the dust-destruction region or with the magnetospheric gas-truncation radius in the protoplanetary disks that surround them during the pre-MS phase. However, previous analyses have only considered low-mass FGK stars, making it difficult to disentangle the two scenarios. This exploratory study is aimed at testing whether it is the inner dust or gas disk driving the location of short-period, giant planets. By combining TESS and Gaia DR3 data, we identified a sample of 47 intermediate-mass (1.5-3 M$_{\odot}$) MS stars hosting confirmed and firm candidate hot Jupiters. We compared their orbits with the rough position of the inner dust and gas disks, which are well separated around their Herbig stars precursors. We also made a comparison with the orbits of confirmed hot Jupiters around a similarly extracted TESS/Gaia sample of low-mass sources (0.5-1.5 M$_{\odot}$). Our results suggest that the inner gas (and not the dust) disk limits the innermost orbits of hot Jupiters around intermediate-mass stars. These findings also provide tentative support to previous works that have claimed this is indeed the case for low-mass sources. We propose that hot Jupiters could be explained via a combination of the core-accretion paradigm and migration up to the gas-truncation radius, which may be responsible for halting inward migration regardless of the stellar mass regime. Larger samples of intermediate-mass stars with hot Jupiters are necessary to confirm our hypothesis, which implies that massive Herbig stars without magnetospheres (> 3-4 M$_{\odot}$) may be the most efficient in swallowing their newborn planets.
#### Unveiling the Physics of Neutron Stars: A 3D expedition into  MAgneto-Thermal evolution in Isolated Neutron Stars with MATINS

 - **Abstract**
 This doctoral thesis investigates the long-term evolution of the strong magnetic fields within isolated neutron stars (NSs), the most potent magnetic objects in the universe. Their magnetic influence extends beyond their surface to encompass the magnetised plasma in their vicinity. The overarching magnetic configuration significantly impacts the observable characteristics of the highly magnetised NSs, i.e., magnetars. Conversely, the internal magnetic field undergoes prolonged evolution spanning thousands to millions of years, intricately linked to thermal evolution. The diverse observable phenomena associated with NSs underscore the complex 3D nature of their magnetic structure, thereby requiring sophisticated numerical simulations. A central focus of this thesis involves a thorough exploration of state-of-the-art 3D coupled magneto-thermal evolution models. This marks a pioneering achievement as we conduct, for the first time, the most realistic 3D simulations to date, spanning the first million years of a NS's life using the newly developed code MATINS, which adeptly accounts for both Ohmic dissipation and Hall drift within the NS's crust. Our simulations incorporate highly accurate temperature-dependent microphysical calculations and adopt the star's structure based on a realistic equation of state. To address axial singularities in 3D simulations, we employ the cubed-sphere coordinates. We also account for corresponding relativistic factors in the evolution equations and use the latest envelope model from existing literature, in addition to an initial magnetic field structure derived from proton-NS dynamo simulations. Within this framework, we quantitatively simulate the thermal luminosity, timing properties, and magnetic field evolution, pushing the boundaries of numerical modeling capabilities and enabling the performance of several astrophysical studies within this thesis.

 - **Abstract**
 We carry out an advanced morpho-kinematic analysis of the Planetary Nebula (PN) NGC 2818, whose complex morphology is described by a basic bipolar component, filamentary structures and a knotty central region. We performed an upgrated 3D Morpho-kinematic (MK) model by employing the SHAPE software, combining for the first time in PNe optical 2D spatially resolved echelle spectra and Fabry-Perot data cubes. The best-fitting 3D model of NGC 2818 successfully reconstructs the main morphology, considering one bipolar component, radial filamentary structures, and an equatorial component as the geometrical locus of the group of cometary knots. The model shows that the equatorial component has the lower expansion velocity of the system at 70 $\pm$ 20 km/s. The velocity of the bipolar component is 120 $\pm$ 20 km/s, while all the filamentary structures were found to expand at higher velocities of 180 $\pm$ 20 km/s. Moreover, Fabry-Perot data revealed for the first time a north-eastern filament expanding at a mean velocity of 80 $\pm$ 20 km/s, while its equivalent counterpart in the southwestern region was confirmed by a new detected substructure in the echelle data. A new detected knotty structure at velocity -40 $\pm$ 20 km/s is also reported, as expelled material from the fragmented eastern lobe of the nebula. We interpret the overall structure of NGC 2818 as the result of the evolution of a binary system that underwent the common envelope phase, in conjunction with the ejections of a magnetized jet, misaligned with respect to the symmetry axis of the bipolar/elliptical shell.

 - **Abstract**
 Ion Weibel instability is considered to be the dominant physics for the dissipation in high-Mach number astrophysical shocks such as supernova remnant shocks and gamma-ray burst shocks. We study the instability dependence on various parameters using theory and particle-in-cell simulations. We demonstrate that electron physics determines the saturation level of the Weibel-generated magnetic field, even though the instability is driven by the ions. We discuss the application to astrophysical and laboratory laser experiment environments to clarify the roles of the ion Weibel instability. We develop a model for the isotropization length scale in Weibel-mediated shocks and compare its value to other characteristic length scales of each system. We find that electron heating to near equipartition is crucial for the formation of ultra-relativistic Weibel-mediated shocks. On the other hand, our results imply that non-relativistic shocks in typical interstellar medium are not purely mediated by the Weibel instability.

 - **Abstract**
 We have investigated the physical properties of Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (PGCCs) located in the Galactic Plane, using the JCMT Plane Survey (JPS) and the SCUBA-2 Continuum Observations of Pre-protostellar Evolution (SCOPE) survey. By utilising a suite of molecular-line surveys, velocities and distances were assigned to the compact sources within the PGCCs, placing them in a Galactic context. The properties of these compact sources show no large-scale variations with Galactic environment. Investigating the star-forming content of the sample, we find that the luminosity-to-mass ratio (L/M) is an order of magnitude lower than in other Galactic studies, indicating that these objects are hosting lower levels of star formation. Finally, by comparing ATLASGAL sources that are associated or are not associated with PGCCs, we find that those associated with PGCCs are typically colder, denser, and have a lower L/M ratio, hinting that PGCCs are a distinct population of Galactic Plane sources.
