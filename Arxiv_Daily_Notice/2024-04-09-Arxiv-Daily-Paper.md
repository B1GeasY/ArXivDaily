 - **Abstract**
 The increasing availability of free high-resolution earth observation data covering any point on the globe every few days led to the emergence of new remote sensing tools that can manipulate the very large volumes of data generated by those satellites. We present Sen2Chain, an open-source Python tool that can automate the processing of large time series of Sentinel-2 images for their use in various fields (e.g., environmental health, natural hazards, ecology). Sen2Chain allows downloading images from various earth observation data suppliers, applying geometric and atmospheric corrections using ESA's Sen2Cor tool, and generating and applying cloud masks. Sen2Chain's ability to extract time series of spectral indices (e.g NDVI, NDWI) provides simplified access to value-added environmental information for a wide range of end-users and applications. Sen2Chain enables all data processing stages to be customized and chained together, with the possibility to automate and parallelize the processing, and optimize data management. Sen2Chain is paving the way for the creation and processing of a large earth observation image database dedicated to users who require time-series and/or perform regular environmental observations. The Web tool Sen2Extract is also presented, which enables end-users with no expertise in remote sensing to easily extract time-series for 11 spectral indices values for specific regions of interest.

 - **Abstract**
 Suzaku X-ray observations of the Type Ia supernova remnant (SNR) 3C 397 discovered exceptionally high mass ratios of Mn/Fe, Ni/Fe, and Cr/Fe, consistent with a near $M_{\rm Ch}$ progenitor white dwarf (WD). The Suzaku observations have established 3C 397 as our best candidate for a near-$M_{\rm Ch}$ SNR Ia, and opened the way to address additional outstanding questions about the origin and explosion mechanism of these transients. In particular, subsequent XMM-Newton observations revealed an unusually clumpy distribution of iron group elemental (IGE) abundances within the ejecta of 3C 397. In this paper, we undertake a suite of two dimensional hydrodynamical models, varying both the explosion mechanism -- either deflagration-to-detonation (DDT), or pure deflagration -- WD progenitors, and WD progenitor metallicity, and analyze their detailed nucleosynthetic abundances and associated clumping. We find that pure deflagrations naturally give rise to clumpy distributions of neutronized species concentrated towards the outer limb of the remnant, and confirm DDTs have smoothly structured ejecta with a central concentration of neutronization. Our findings indicate that 3C 397 was most likely a pure deflagration of a high central density WD. We discuss a range of implications of these findings for the broader SN Ia progenitor problem.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations covering the NGC 1977 region at 3.0, 6.4, and 15.0 GHz. We search for compact radio sources and detect continuum emission from 34 NGC 1977 cluster members and 37 background objects. Of the 34 radio-detected cluster members, 3 are associated with known proplyds in NGC 1977, 22 are associated with additional young stellar objects in NGC 1977, and 9 are newly-identified cluster members. We examine the radio spectral energy distributions, circular polarization, and variability of the detected NGC 1977 sources, and identify 10 new candidate proplyds whose radio fluxes are dominated by optically thin free-free emission. We use measurements of free-free emission to calculate the mass-loss rates of known proplyds and new candidate proplyds in NGC 1977, and find values $\sim10^{-9}-10^{-8}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, which are lower than the mass-loss rates measured towards proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster, but consistent with the mass-loss rates predicted by external photoevaporation models for spatially-extended disks that are irradiated by the typical external UV fields encountered in NGC 1977. Finally, we show that photoevaporative disk winds in NGC 1977 may be illuminated by internal or external sources of ionization, depending on their positions within the cluster. This study provides new constraints on disk properties in a clustered star-forming region with a weaker UV environment than the Orion Nebula Cluster, but a stronger UV environment than low-mass star-forming regions like Taurus. Such intermediate UV environments represent the typical conditions of Galactic star and planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Most debris discs consist of a gas-poor, cold dust belt located tens to hundreds of astronomical units away from the host star. Many cold dust belts exhibit distinct structures attributed to the dynamic interaction of planetary systems. Moreover, in a few systems, additional warm components can be found closer to the central star, resembling the asteroid belt or zodiacal dust in our Solar System. In this work, we investigate the structure of the disc surrounding the nearby F2V star HD 105211, which has a warm excess and a potential asymmetry in the cold belt. We applied the CASA pipeline to obtain the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum images. Then we constructed the SED and performed MCMC simulations to fit a model to the ALMA visibility data. To characterise the disc asymmetry, we analysed the ALMA images of two individual observation blocks and compared them to the previous Herschel images. Our modelling reveals that the disc is a narrow ring (23.6+-4.6 au) with low eccentricity positioned at a distance of 133.7+-1.6 au from the central star, which differs from the broad disc (100+-20 au) starting at an inner edge of 87+-2.5 au, inferred from the Herschel images. We found that both observation blocks show excess emission at the stellar position, while OB1 shows an offset between the star and the phase centre, and OB2 shows brightness clumps. We used a two-temperature model to fit the infrared SED and used the ALMA detection to constrain the warm component to a nearly pure blackbody model. The relatively low ratio of actual radius to blackbody radius of the HD105211 debris disc indicates that this system is depleted in small grains, which could indicate that it is dynamically cold. The excess emission from the stellar position suggests that there should be a warm mm-sized dust component close to the star, for which we suggest two possible origins: in situ asteroid belt or comet delivery.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a method of extrapolating the spectroscopic behavior of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength regime up to 2.30 $\mu$m using optical spectroscopy. Such a process is useful for accurately estimating K-corrections and other photometric quantities of SNe Ia in the NIR. Principal component analysis is performed on data consisting of Carnegie Supernova Project I & II optical and near-infrared FIRE spectra to produce models capable of making these extrapolations. This method differs from previous spectral template methods by not parameterizing models strictly by photometric light-curve properties of SNe Ia, allowing for more flexibility of the resulting extrapolated NIR flux. A difference of around -3.1% to -2.7% in the total integrated NIR flux between these extrapolations and the observations is seen here for most test cases including Branch core-normal and shallow-silicon subtypes. However, larger deviations from the observation are found for other tests, likely due to the limited high-velocity and broad-line SNe Ia in the training sample. Maximum-light principal components are shown to allow for spectroscopic predictions of the color-stretch light-curve parameter, $s_{BV}$, within approximately $\pm$0.1 units of the value measured with photometry. We also show these results compare well with NIR templates, although in most cases the templates are marginally more fitting to observations, illustrating a need for more concurrent optical+NIR spectroscopic observations to truly understand the diversity of SNe Ia in the NIR.

 - **Abstract**
 While 30 Dor C is a unique superbubble in the Large Magellanic Cloud for its luminous non-thermal X-ray emission, the thermal X-ray emission it emanates has not yet been thoroughly investigated and well constrained. Based on the separate ~1 Ms deep XMM-Newton and Chandra observations, we report the discovery of the thermally-emitting plasma in some portions of the western half of 30 Dor C. The thermal emission can be reproduced by a collisional-ionization-equilibrium plasma model with an average electron temperature of ~0.4 keV. We find a significant overabundance of the intermediate-mass elements such as O, Ne, Mg, and Si, which may be indicative of a recent supernova explosion in 30 Dor C. Dynamical properties in combination with the information of the OB association LH 90 suggest that the internal post-main-sequence stars dominate the power of the superbubble and blow it out in the past ~1 Myr.

 - **Abstract**
 The physical properties of galactic molecular outflows are important as they could constrain outflow formation mechanisms. We study the properties of the southwest (SW) outflow streamer including gas kinematics, optical depth, dense gas fraction, and shock strength in the central molecular zone of the starburst galaxy NGC 253. We image the molecular emission at a spatial resolution of $\sim$27 pc based on data from the ALCHEMI program. We trace the kinematics of molecular gas with CO(1-0) line. We constrain the optical depth of CO emission with CO/$^{13}$CO(1-0) ratio, the dense gas fraction with HCN/CO(1-0) ratio, as well as the shock strength with SiO(2-1)/$^{13}$CO(1-0) ratio. The CO/$^{13}$CO(1-0) integrated intensity ratio is $\sim$21 in the SW streamer region, which approximates the C/$^{13}$C isotopic abundance ratio. The higher integrated intensity ratio compared to the disk can be attributed to the optically thinner environment for CO(1-0) emission inside the SW streamer. The HCN/CO(1-0) and SiO(2-1)/$^{13}$CO(1-0) integrated intensity ratios both approach $\sim$0.2 in three giant molecular clouds (GMCs) at the base of the outflow streamers, which implies the higher dense gas fraction and enhanced strength of fast shocks in those GMCs than in the disk. The contours of those two integrated intensity ratios are extended towards the directions of outflow streamers, which connects the enhanced dense gas fraction and shock strength with molecular outflow. Moreover, the molecular gas with enhanced dense gas fraction and shock strength located at the base of the SW streamer shares the same velocity with the outflow. These phenomena suggest that the star formation inside the GMCs can trigger the shocks and further drive the molecular outflow.

 - **Abstract**
 KM2A is one of the main sub-arrays of LHAASO, working on gamma ray astronomy and cosmic ray physics at energies above 10 TeV. Detector simulation is the important foundation for estimating detector performance and data analysis. It is a big challenge to simulate the KM2A detector in the framework of Geant4 due to the need to track numerous photons from a large number of detector units (>6000) with large altitude difference (30 m) and huge coverage (1.3 km^2). In this paper, the design of the KM2A simulation code G4KM2A based on Geant4 is introduced. The process of G4KM2A is optimized mainly in memory consumption to avoid memory overffow. Some simpliffcations are used to signiffcantly speed up the execution of G4KM2A. The running time is reduced by at least 30 times compared to full detector simulation. The particle distributions and the core/angle resolution comparison between simulation and experimental data of the full KM2A array are also presented, which show good agreement.
#### A born ultramassive white dwarf-hot subdwarf super-Chandrasekhar  candidate

 - **Abstract**
 Although supernovae is a well-known endpoint of an accreting white dwarf, alternative theoretical possibilities has been discussing broadly, such as the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) event as the endpoint of oxygen-neon (ONe) white dwarfs, either accreting up to or merging to excess the Chandrasekhar limit (the maximum mass of a stable white dwarf). AIC is an important channel to form neutron stars, especially for those unusual systems, which are hardly produced by core-collapse supernovae. However, the observational evidences for this theoretical predicted event and its progenitor are all very limited. In all of the known progenitors, white dwarfs increase in mass by accretion. Here, we report the discovery of an intriguing binary system Lan 11, consisted of a stripped core-helium-burning hot subdwarf and an unseen compact object of 1.08 to 1.35 $M_{\odot}$. Our binary population synthesis calculations, along with the absence of detection from the deep radio observations of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope, strongly suggest that the latter is an ONe white dwarf. The total mass of this binary is 1.67 to 1.92 $M_{\odot}$}, significantly excessing the Chandrasekhar limit. The reproduction of its evolutionary history indicates that the unique system has undergone two phases of common envelope ejections, implying a born nature of this massive ONe white dwarf rather than an accretion growth from its companion. These results, together with short orbital period of this binary (3.65 hours), suggest that this system will merge in 500-540 Myr, largely triggering an AIC event, although the possibility of type Ia supernova cannot be fully ruled out. This finding greatly provides valuable constraints on our understanding of stellar endpoints, whatever leading to an AIC or a supernova.

 - **Abstract**
 Methods. We utilized the combined five SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey data (eRASS:5) to perform X-ray imaging and spectral analyses of the Centaurus cluster in various directions to large radii. Surface brightness (SB) profiles out to $2R_{200}$ were constructed. We acquired gas temperature, metallicity, and normalization per area profiles out to $R_{200}$. We compared our results with previous Centaurus studies, cluster outskirts measurements, and simulations. Comprehensive sky background analysis was done across the FoV, in particular, to assess the variation of the eROSITA Bubble emission that partially contaminates the field. Results. The processed X-ray images show the known sloshing-induced structures in the core. The core ($r\leq11~\mathrm{kpc}$) is better described with a 2T model than a 1T model. Here, we measured lower T from the cooler component (~1.0 keV) and higher Z ($\sim\!1.6Z_\odot$), signifying an iron bias. In the intermediate radial range, we observed prominent SB and normalization per area excesses in the eastern sector (Cen 45 location), reaching out to $R_{500}$. Temperature enhancements near the location of Cen 45 imply that the gas is shock-heated due to the interaction with Cen 30, the significant excess behind Cen 45 center might be the tail/ram-pressure-stripped gas. We found good agreement between the outskirt temperatures with the profile from simulations and fit from Suzaku outskirts measurements. We detected significant SB emission to the sky background level out to $R_{200}$ with a $3.5\sigma$ and followed by $2.9\sigma$ at $1.1R_{200}$. The metallicity at $R_{500}-R_{200}$ is low but within the ranges of other outskirts studies. Conclusions. We present the first measurement of ICM morphology and properties of Centaurus cluster sampling the whole azimuth beyond $30'$, increasing the probed volume by a factor of almost 30.
#### Searching for Magnetar Binaries Disrupted by Core-Collapse Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse Supernovae (CCSNe) are considered to be the primary magnetar formation channel, with 15 magnetars associated with supernova remnants (SNRs). A large fraction of these should occur in massive stellar binaries that are disrupted by the explosion, meaning that $\sim45\%$ of magnetars should be nearby high-velocity stars. Here we conduct a multi-wavelength search for unbound stars, magnetar binaries, and SNR shells using public optical ($uvgrizy-$bands), infrared ($J-$, $H-$, $K-$, and $K_s-$bands), and radio ($888$ MHz, $1.4$ GHz, and $3$ GHz) catalogs. We use Monte Carlo analyses of candidates to estimate the probability of association with a given magnetar based on their proximity, distance, proper motion, and magnitude. In addition to recovering a proposed magnetar binary, a proposed unbound binary, and 13 of 15 magnetar SNRs, we identify two new candidate unbound systems: an OB star from the Gaia catalog we associate with SGR J1822.3-1606, and an X-ray pulsar we associate with 3XMM J185246.6+003317. Using a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulation that assumes all magnetars descend from CCSNe, we constrain the fraction of magnetars with unbound companions to $5\lesssim f_u \lesssim 24\%$, which disagrees with population synthesis results. Alternate formation channels are unlikely to wholly account for the lack of unbound binaries as this would require $31\lesssim f_{nc} \lesssim 66\%$ of magnetars to descend from such channels. Our results support a high fraction ($48\lesssim f_m \lesssim 86\%$) of pre-CCSN mergers, which can amplify fossil magnetic fields to preferentially form magnetars.
#### A model for heating the super-hot corona in solar active regions

 - **Abstract**
 What physical mechanisms heat the outer solar or stellar atmosphere to million-Kelvin temperatures is a fundamental but long-standing open question. In particular, the solar corona in active region cores contains an even hotter component reaching ten million Kelvin, manifesting as persistent coronal loops in extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray images, which imposes a more stringent energy budget. Here, we present a self-consistent coronal heating model using a state-of-the-art three-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamics simulation. We find that the continuous magnetic flux emergence in active regions keeps driving magnetic reconnections that release energy impulsively but, on time average, persistently. As a result, numerous sub-structures are heated to ten million Kelvin and then evolve independently, which collectively form long-lived and stable coronal loops as in observations. This provides a heating model explaining the origin of the super-hot coronal plasma and the persistence of hot coronal loops in emerging active regions.

 Millimeter-waveband spectra of Venus from both the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) provide conclusive evidence (signal-to-noise ratio of about $15\sigma$) of a phosphine absorption-line profile against the thermal background from deeper, hotter layers of the atmosphere. Phosphine is an important biomarker; e.g., the trace of phosphine in the Earth's atmosphere is uniquivocally associated with anthropogenic activity and microbial life (which produces this highly reducing gas even in an overall oxidizing environment). Motivated by the JCMT and ALMA tantalizing observations we reexamine whether Venus could accommodate Earthly life. More concretly, we hypothesize that the microorganisms populating the venusian atmosphere are not free floating but confined to the liquid environment inside cloud aerosols or droplets. Armed with this hypothesis, we generalize a study of airborne germ transmission to constrain the maximum size of droplets that could be floating in the venusian atmosphere and estimate whether their Stokes fallout times to reach moderately high temperatures are pronouncedly larger than the microbe's replication time. We also comment on the effect of cosmic ray showers on the evolution of aerial microbial life.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron stars are the dense and highly magnetic relics of supernova explosions of massive stars. The quest to constrain the Equation of State (EoS) of ultra-dense matter and thereby probe the behavior of matter inside neutron stars, is one of the core goals of modern physics and astrophysics. A promising method involves investigating the long-term cooling of neutron stars, and comparing theoretical predictions with various sources at different ages. However, limited observational data, and uncertainties in source ages and distances, have hindered this approach. In this work, re-analyzing XMM-Newton and Chandra data from dozens of thermally emitting isolated neutron stars, we have identified three sources with unexpectedly cold surface temperatures for their young ages. To investigate these anomalies, we conducted magneto-thermal simulations across diverse mass and magnetic fields, considering three different EoS. We found that the "minimal" cooling model, failed to explain the observations, regardless the mass and the magnetic field, as validated by a machine learning classification method. The existence of these young cold neutron stars suggests that any dense matter EoS must be compatible with a fast cooling process at least in certain mass ranges, eliminating a significant portion of current EoS options according to recent meta-modelling analysis.
#### Search and study of young infrared stellar clusters

 - **Abstract**
 The main aim of this paper is to study both the Interstellar Medium (ISM) and the young stellar population in the three star-forming regions, namely IRAS 05137+3919, 05168+3634, and 19110+1045. The study of the ISM includes determination of the hydrogen column density (N(H_2)) and dust temperature (T_d) in the regions using Modified blackbody fitting. The main parameters of identified and classified young stellar objects (YSOs) belonging to the regions were determined comparing with the radiation transfer models. We also constructed a colour-magnitude diagram to compare the parameters of the YSOs with the results of the radiative transfer models. The three stellar populations appear to have formed under different scenarios. In the cases of IRAS 05137+3919 and IRAS 05168+3634, the age spread is considerably wider, suggesting that the stellar population likely emerged from independent condensations. In contrast, the third region comprises a pair of ultra-compact HII regions (UCHIIs), G45.12+0.13 and G45.07+0.13, with a notably smaller age spread. This hints at the possibility that these clusters originated from a single triggering event.

 - **Abstract**
 EX Lupi, a low-mass young stellar object, went into an accretion-driven outburst in March of 2022. The outburst caused a sudden phase change of ~ 112$^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 5$^{\circ}$ in periodically oscillating multiband lightcurves. Our high resolution spectra obtained with HRS on SALT also revealed a consistent phase change in the periodically varying radial velocities, along with an increase in the radial velocity amplitude of various emission lines. The phase change and increase of radial velocity amplitude morphologically translates to a change in the azimuthal and latitudinal location of the accretion hotspot over the stellar surface, which indicates a reconfiguration of the accretion funnel geometry. Our 3D MHD simulations reproduce the phase change for EX Lupi. To explain the observations we explored the possibility of forward shifting of the dipolar accretion funnel as well as the possibility of an emergence of a new accretion funnel. During the outburst, we also found evidence of the hotspot's morphology extending azimuthally, asymmetrically with a leading hot edge and cold tail along the stellar rotation. Our high cadence photometry showed that the accretion flow has clumps. We also detected possible clumpy accretion events in the HRS spectra, that showed episodically highly blue-shifted wings in the Ca II IRT and Balmer H lines.

 - **Abstract**
 We probe the astrophysical gravitational-wave background resulting from compact binary coalescences, focusing on Population III binary black holes. We exploit results of state-of-the-art simulations on the evolution of Population I-II and III binaries, considering a variety of initial condition and star formation rate models for the latter. The contribution from Population III binary black holes is found to be very small, with no effect on the gravitational-wave spectrum. A network of third-generation detectors will detect easier individual Population III binaries, due to their significantly higher masses, hence decreasing even further their residual contribution.
