 - **Abstract**
 One of the biggest puzzles regarding the circumgalactic medium (CGM) is the structure of its cool ($T\sim10^4$ K) gas phase. While the kinematics of quasar absorption systems suggests the CGM is composed of a population of different clouds, constraining the clouds' extent and spatial distribution has proven challenging, both from the theoretical and observational points of view. In this work we study the spatial structure of the $z\sim 1$ CGM with unprecedented detail via resolved spectroscopy of giant gravitational arcs. We put together a sample of Mg II$\lambda\lambda 2796,2803$ detections obtained with VLT/MUSE in 91 spatially independent and contiguous sight-lines toward 3 arcs, each probing an isolated star-forming galaxy believed to be detected in absorption. We constrain the coherence scale of this gas ($C_{\rm{length}}$), which represents the spatial scale over which the Mg II equivalent width (EW) remains constant, by comparing EW variations measured across all sight-lines with empirical models. We find $1.4 <C_{\rm{length}}/\rm{kpc} <7.8$ (95% confidence). This measurement, of unprecedented accuracy, represents the scale over which the cool gas tends to cluster in separate structures. We argue that, if $C_{\rm{length}}$ is a universal property of the CGM, it needs to be reproduced by current and future theoretical models in order to understand the exact role of this medium in galaxy evolution.
#### Study of spectral index of giant radio galaxy from Leahy's Atlas: DA 240

 - **Abstract**
 Here we investigate the giant radio galaxy DA 240, which is a FR II source. Specifically, we investigate its flux density, as well as the spectral index distribution. For that purpose, we used publicly available data for the source: Leahy's atlas of double radio-sources and NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED). We used observations at 326 MHz (92 cm) and at 608 MHz (49 cm) and obtained spectral index distributions between 326 and 608 MHz. For the first time we give spectral index map for these frequencies. We found that the synchrotron radiation is the dominant radiation mechanism over most of the area of DA 240, and also investigated the mechanism of radiation at some characteristic points, namely its core and the hotspots. The results of this study will be helpful for understanding the evolutionary process of the DA 240 radio source.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the combination of ALMA-IMF and single-dish continuum images from the Mustang-2 Galactic Plane Survey (MGPS90) at 3 millimeters and the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) at 1 millimeter. Six and ten out of the fiffteen ALMA-IMF fields are combined with MGPS90 and BGPS, respectively. The combination is made via the feathering technique. We used the dendrogram algorithm throughout the combined images, and performed further analysis in the six fields with combination in both bands (G012.80, W43-MM1, W43-MM2, W43-MM3, W51-E, W51-IRS2). In these fields, we calculated spectral index maps and used them to separate regions dominated by dust or free-free emission, and then performed further structural analysis. We report the basic physical parameters of the dust-dominated (column densities, masses) and ionized (emission measures, hydrogen ionization photon rates) structures. We also searched for multi-scale relations in the dust-dominated structures across the analyzed fields, finding that the fraction of mass in dendrogram leaves (which we label as "Leaf Mass Eficiency", LME) as a function of molecular gas column density follows a similar trend: a rapid, exponential-like growth, with maximum values approaching 100% in most cases. The observed behaviour of the LME with gas column is tentatively interpreted as an indicator of large star formation activity within the ALMA-IMF protoclusters. W51-E and G012.80 stand out as cases with comparatively large and reduced potential for further star formation, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar turbulence shapes the HI distribution in the Milky Way (MW). How this affects large-scale statistical properties of HI column density across the MW remains largely unconstrained. We use approx 13,000 square-degree GALFA-HI survey to map statistical fluctuations of HI over the 40 km s-1 velocity range. We calculate the spatial power spectrum (SPS) of HI column density image by running a 3-degree kernel and measuring SPS slope over a range of angular scales from 16 arcmin to 20 degree. Due to GALFA complex observing and calibration strategy, we construct detailed estimates of the noise contribution and account for GALFA beam effects on SPS. This allows us to systematically analyze HI images that trace a wide range of interstellar environments. We find that SPS slope varies between -2.6 at high Galactic latitudes, and -3.2 close to Galactic plane. The range of SPS slope values becomes tighter when we consider HI optical depth and line-of-sight length caused by the plane-parallel geometry of HI disk. This relatively uniform, large-scale distribution of SPS slope is suggestive of large-scale turbulent driving being a dominant mechanism for shaping HI structures in the MW and/or the stellar feedback turbulence being efficiently dissipated within dense molecular clouds. Only at latitudes above 60 degrees we find evidence for HI SPS slope being consistently more shallow. Those directions are largely within the Local Bubble, suggesting the recent history of this cavity, shaped by multiple supernovae explosions, has modified the turbulent state of HI and/or fractions of HI phases.
#### Computed Rotational Collision Rate Coefficients for Recently Detected  Anionic Cyanopolyynes

 - **Abstract**
 We report new results from quantum calculations of energy-transfer processes taking place in interstellar environments and involving two newly observed molecular species: C$_5$N$^-$ and C$_7$N$^-$ in collision with He atoms and the p-H$_2$ molecules. These species are part of the anionic molecular chains labeled as cyanopolyynes which have been observed over the years in molecule-rich Circumstellar Envelopes and in molecular clouds. In the present work, we first carry out new $ab$ $initio$ calculations for the C$_7$N$^-$ interaction potential with He atom and then obtain state-to-state rotationally inelastic cross sections and rate coefficients involving the same transitions which have been observed experimentally by emission in the interstellar medium (ISM) from both of these linear species. For the C$_5$N$^-$/He system we extend the calculations already published in our earlier work (see reference below) to compare more directly the two molecular anions. We extend further the quantum calculations by also computing in this work collision rate coefficients for the hydrogen molecule interacting with C5N$^-$, using our previously computed interaction potential. Additionally, we obtain the same rate coefficients for the C$_7$N$^-$/H$_2$ system by using a scaling procedure that makes use of the new C$_7$N$^-$/He rate coefficients, as discussed in detail in the present paper. Their significance in affecting internal state populations in ISM environments where the title anions have been found is analyzed by using the concept of critical density indicators. Finally, similarities and differences between such species and the comparative efficiency of their collision rate coefficients are discussed. These new calculations suggest that, at least for the case of these longer chains, the rotational populations could reach local thermal equilibrium conditions within their observational environments.
#### Formation of Lower Mass-gap Black Hole--Neutron Star Binary Mergers  through Super-Eddington Stable Mass Transfer

 - **Abstract**
 Super-Eddington accretion of neutron stars (NSs) has been suggested both observationally and theoretically. In this paper, we propose that NSs in close-orbit binary systems with companions of helium (He) stars, most of which systems form after the common-envelope phase, could experience super-Eddington stable Case BB/BC mass transfer (MT), and can sometimes occur accretion-induced collapses (AICs) to form lower mass-gap black holes (mgBHs). Our detailed binary evolution simulations reveal that AIC events tend to happen if the primaries NS have an initial mass $\gtrsim1.7\,M_\odot$ with an accretion rate of $\gtrsim300$ times the Eddington limit. These mgBHs would have a mass nearly equal to or slightly higher than the NS maximum mass. The remnant mgBH--NS binaries after the core collapses of He stars are potential progenitors of gravitational-wave (GW) source. Multimessenger observation between GW and kilonova signals from a population of high-mass binary NS and mgBH--NS mergers formed through super-Eddington stable MT are helpful in constraining the maximum mass and equation of state of NSs. S230529ay, a mgBH--NS merger candidate recently detected in the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, could possibly originate from this formation scenario.
#### Revealing the Chemical Structure of the Magellanic Clouds with APOGEE.  III. Abundance Gradients of the Small Magellanic Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 We determine radial- and age-abundance gradients of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using spectra of 2,062 red giant branch (RGB) field stars observed by SDSS-IV / APOGEE-2S. With coverage out to $\sim$9 kpc in the SMC, these data taken with the high resolution ($R \sim 22,500$) APOGEE $H$-band spectrograph afford the opportunity to measure extensive radial gradients for as many as 24 abundance ratios. The SMC is found to have an overall metallicity gradient of $-$0.0546 $\pm$ 0.0043 dex/kpc. Ages are calculated for every star to explore the evolution of the different abundance gradients. As a function of age, many of the gradients show a feature 3.66--5.58 Gyr ago, which is especially prominent in the [X/H] gradients. Initially many gradients flatten until about $\sim$5.58 Gyr ago, but then steepen in more recent times. We previously detected similar evolutionary patterns in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) which are attributed to a recent interaction between the LMC and SMC. It is inferred that the feature in the SMC gradients was caused by the same interaction. The age-[X/Fe] trends, which track average [X/Fe] over time, are flat, demonstrating a slow enrichment history for the SMC. When comparing the SMC gradients to the LMC and MW, normalized to disk scale length ($R_\text{d}$), the [X/Fe] and [X/Mg] gradients are similar, but there is a dichotomy between the dwarfs and the Milky Way (MW) for the [X/H] gradients. The median MW [X/H] gradient around $-$0.125 dex/$R_\text{d}$ whilst the Clouds have gradients of about $-$0.075 dex/$R_\text{d}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the kinematics of the recently discovered Corona Australis (CrA) chain of clusters by examining the 3D space motion of its young stars using Gaia DR3 and APOGEE-2 data. While we observe linear expansion between the clusters in the Cartesian XY directions, the expansion along Z exhibits a curved pattern. To our knowledge, this is the first time such a nonlinear velocity-position relation has been observed for stellar clusters. We propose a scenario to explain our findings, in which the observed gradient is caused by stellar feedback, accelerating the gas away from the Galactic plane. A traceback analysis confirms that the CrA star formation complex was located near the central clusters of the Scorpius Centaurus (Sco-Cen) OB association 10-15 Myr ago. It contains massive stars and thus offers a natural source of feedback. Based on the velocity of the youngest unbound CrA cluster, we estimate that a median number of about two supernovae would have been sufficient to inject the present-day kinetic energy of the CrA molecular cloud. This number agrees with that of recent studies. The head-tail morphology of the CrA molecular cloud further supports the proposed feedback scenario, in which a feedback force pushed the primordial cloud from the Galactic north, leading to the current separation of 100 pc from the center of Sco-Cen. The formation of spatially and temporally well-defined star formation patterns, such as the CrA chain of clusters, is likely a common process in massive star-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The density functional theory (DFT) is the most versatile electronic structure method used in quantum chemical calculations, and is increasingly applied in astrochemical research. This mini-review provides an overview of the applications of DFT calculations in understanding the chemistry that occurs in star-forming regions. We survey investigations into the formation of biologically-relevant compounds such as nucleobases in the interstellar medium, and also covers the formation of both achiral and chiral amino acids, as well as biologically-relevant molecules such as sugars, and nitrogen-containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Additionally, DFT calculations are used to estimate the potential barriers for chemical reactions in astronomical environments. We conclude by noting several areas that require more research, such as the formation pathways of chiral amino acids, complex sugars and other biologically-important molecules, and the role of environmental factors in the formation of interstellar biomolecules.

 - **Abstract**
 To investigate the physical nature of neutrino-heating on the result of a 1-dimensional core-collapse supernova. Colgate were the first to suggest that neutrinos may play a crucial role in core collapse supernova by taking up gravitational binding energy from the core and depositing it in the rest of the star. The fluid is contained in a shock tube in a region extending from the neutrino-sphere of a star out 1000 km, and irradiated with a neutrino flux emanating from the surface of the neutrino-sphere into the shock tube. Interaction due to electron-neutrino scattering off of fluid nucleons is used to account for neutrino heating of the fluid. The numerical method used is the Godunov method implementing an exact Riemann solver Rezzolla when needed. The simulated core-collapse produces an energy output of up to $10^{36}$J on a timescale of 3.33 s. It was found that the Godunov method performs very well using Sod data, with standard deviations of between $0.22-0.04$%. Thus, there is high confidence that the exact Riemann solver is working correctly and that the Godunov method is also reproducing the exact solutions to the Sod data with high confidence. A runtime of 3.33 s was used. The objective was to determine what would happen to the shock system over longer timescales, but the simulations showed an explosion in a much shorter time frame. It was found that the shock not only continues to move outward, but is also driven by large energy and pressure behind the shock. The density profiles show that fluid mass is pushed outward, but the fluid velocity actually reversed on timescales close to 3.33 s. In this paper, net mass movement occurs at 500-600 km and on a longer timescale of 3.33 s mass has moved out to 700 km. This supports the \emph{delayed post bounce shock mechanism}.

 - **Abstract**
 At the far reaches of the outer Solar System, the ice giants remain the last class of planets yet to be studied using orbiters. The 2023-2032 Planetary Science Decadal Survey has underscored the importance of the ice giants in understanding the origin, formation, and evolution of our Solar System. The enormous heliocentric distance of Uranus presents considerable mission design challenges, the most important being able to reach Uranus within a reasonable time. The present study presents two examples of aerocapture enabled short flight time, fast trajectories for Uranus orbiter missions, and highlights the enormous benefits provided by aerocapture. The first is an EEJU trajectory with a launch opportunity in July 2031 with a flight time of 8 years. The second is an EJU trajectory with a launch opportunity in June 2034 with a flight time of only 5 years. Using the Falcon Heavy Expendable, the available launch capability is 4950 kg and 1400 kg respectively for the two trajectories. Both trajectories have a high arrival speed of 20 km/s, which provides sufficient corridor width for aerocapture. Compared to propulsive insertion architectures which take 13 to 15 years, the fast trajectories offer significant reduction in the flight time.
#### Exploring the circumstellar environment of Tycho's supernova remnant--I.  The hydrodynamic evolution of the shock

 - **Abstract**
 Among Type Ia supernova remnants (SNRs), Tycho's SNR has been considered as a typical object from the viewpoints of its spectroscopic, morphological and environmental properties. A recent reanalysis of Chandra data shows that its forward shock is experiencing a substantial deceleration since around 2007, which suggests recent shock interactions with a dense medium as a consequence of the cavity-wall environment inside a molecular cloud. Such a non-uniform environment can be linked back to the nature and activities of its progenitor. In this study, we perform hydrodynamic simulations to characterize Tycho's cavity-wall environment using the latest multi-epoch proper motion measurements of the forward shock. A range of parameters for the environment is explored in the hydrodynamic models to fit with the observation data for each azimuthal region. Our results show that a wind-like cavity with $\rho(r)\propto r^{-2}$ reconciles with the latest data better than a uniform medium with a constant density. In addition, our best-fit model favors an anisotropic wind with an azimuthally varying wind parameter. The overall result indicates a mass-loss rate which is unusually high for the conventional single-degenerate explosion scenario.
#### TOI-544 b: a potential water-world inside the radius valley in a  two-planet system

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the precise radial velocity follow-up of TOI-544 (HD 290498), a bright K star (V=10.8), which hosts a small transiting planet recently discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We collected 122 high-resolution HARPS and HARPS-N spectra to spectroscopically confirm the transiting planet and measure its mass. The nearly 3-year baseline of our follow-up allowed us to unveil the presence of an additional, non-transiting, longer-period companion planet. We derived a radius and mass for the inner planet, TOI-544b, of 2.018 $\pm$ 0.076 R$_{\oplus}$ and 2.89 $\pm$ 0.48 M$_{\oplus}$ respectively, which gives a bulk density of $1.93^{+0.30}_{-0.25}$ g cm$^{-3}$. TOI-544c has a minimum mass of 21.5 $\pm$ 2.0 M$_{\oplus}$ and orbital period of 50.1 $\pm$ 0.2 days. The low density of planet-b implies that it has either an Earth-like rocky core with a hydrogen atmosphere, or a composition which harbours a significant fraction of water. The composition interpretation is degenerate depending on the specific choice of planet interior models used. Additionally, TOI-544b has an orbital period of 1.55 days and equilibrium temperature of 999 $\pm$ 14 K, placing it within the predicted location of the radius valley, where few planets are expected. TOI-544b is a top target for future atmospheric observations, for example with JWST, which would enable better constraints of the planet composition.
#### Atmospheric carbon depletion as a tracer of water oceans and biomass on  temperate terrestrial exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 The conventional observables to identify a habitable or inhabited environment in exoplanets, such as an ocean glint or abundant atmospheric O$_2$, will be challenging to detect with present or upcoming observatories. Here we suggest a new signature. A low carbon abundance in the atmosphere of a temperate rocky planet, relative to other planets of the same system, traces the presence of substantial amount of liquid water, plate tectonic and/or biomass. We show that JWST can already perform such a search in some selected systems like TRAPPIST-1 via the CO$_2$ band at $4.3\,\rm \mu m$, which falls in a spectral sweet spot where the overall noise budget and the effect of cloud/hazes are optimal. We propose a 3-step strategy for transiting exoplanets: 1) detection of an atmosphere around temperate terrestrial planets in $\sim 10$ transits for the most favorable systems, (2) assessment of atmospheric carbon depletion in $\sim 40$ transits, (3) measurements of O$_3$ abundance to disentangle between a water- vs biomass-supported carbon depletion in $\sim100$ transits. The concept of carbon depletion as a signature for habitability is also applicable for next-generation direct imaging telescopes.
#### Searching for Planets Orbiting Fomalhaut with JWST/NIRCam

 - **Abstract**
 We report observations with the JWST/NIRCam coronagraph of the Fomalhaut system. This nearby A star hosts a complex debris disk system discovered by the IRAS satellite. Observations in F444W and F356W filters using the round 430R mask achieve a contrast ratio of ~ 4 x 10-7 at 1'' and ~ 4 x 10-8 outside of 3''. These observations reach a sensitivity limit <1 MJup across most of the disk region. Consistent with the hypothesis that Fomalhaut b is not a massive planet but is a dust cloud from a planetesimal collision, we do not detect it in either F356W or F444W (the latter band where a Jovian-sized planet should be bright). We have reliably detected 10 sources in and around Fomalhaut and its debris disk, all but one of which are coincident with Keck or HST sources seen in earlier coronagraphic imaging; we show them to be background objects, including the "Great Dust Cloud" identified in MIRI data. However, one of the objects, located at the edge of the inner dust disk seen in the MIRI images, has no obvious counterpart in imaging at earlier epochs and has a relatively red [F356W]-[F444W]>0.7 mag (Vega) color. Whether this object is a background galaxy, brown dwarf, or a Jovian mass planet in the Fomalhaut system will be determined by an approved Cycle 2 follow-up program. Finally, we set upper limits to any scattered light from the outer ring, placing a weak limit on the dust albedo at F356W and F444W.
