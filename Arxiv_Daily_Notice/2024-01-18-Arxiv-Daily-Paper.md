### Today: 9papers 
#### Are James Webb Space Telescope observations consistent with warm dark  matter?
 - **Authors:** Bruce Hoeneisen
 - **Subjects:** Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08730
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08730
 - **Abstract**
 We compare observed with predicted distributions of galaxy stellar masses $M_*$ and galaxy rest-frame ultra-violet luminosities per unit bandwidth $L_{UV}$, in the redshift range $z = 2$ to 13. The comparison is presented as a function of the comoving warm dark matter free-streaming cut-off wavenumber $k_{fs}$. For this comparison the theory is a minimal extension of the Press-Schechter formalism with only two parameters: the star formation efficiency, and a proportionality factor between the star formation rate per galaxy and $L_{UV}$. These two parameters are fixed to their values obtained prior to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) data. The purpose of this comparison is to identify if, and where, detailed astrophysical evolution is needed to account for the new JWST observations.
#### Overview and public data release of the Auriga Project: cosmological  simulations of dwarf and Milky Way-mass galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We present an extended suite of the Auriga cosmological gravo-magnetohydrodynamical ``zoom-in'' simulations of 40 Milky Way-mass halos and 26 dwarf galaxy-mass halos run with the moving-mesh code Arepo. Auriga adopts the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmogony and includes a comprehensive galaxy formation physics model following the coupled cosmic evolution of dark matter, gas, stars, and supermassive black holes which has been shown to produce numerically well-converged galaxy properties for Milky Way-mass systems. We describe the first public data release of this augmented suite of Auriga simulations, which includes raw snapshots, group catalogues, merger trees, initial conditions, and supplementary data, as well as public analysis tools with worked examples of how to use the data. To demonstrate the value and robustness of the simulation predictions, we analyse a series of low-redshift global properties that compare well with many observed scaling relations, such as the Tully-Fisher relation, the star-forming main sequence, and HI gas fraction/disc thickness. Finally, we show that star-forming gas discs appear to build rotation and velocity dispersion rapidly for $z\gtrsim 3$ before they ``settle'' into ever-increasing rotation-dispersion ratios ($V/\sigma$). This evolution appears to be in rough agreement with some kinematic measurements from H$\alpha$ observations, and demonstrates an application of how to utilise the released data.
#### A Bigger Cloud 9? New HI Observations of the RELHIC Candidate M94-Cloud  9
 - **Authors:** Ananthan Karunakaran, Kristine Spekkens
 - **Subjects:** Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08765
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08765
 - **Abstract**
 We present new HI observations of the REionization-Limited HI Cloud (RELHIC) candidate, M94-CL9, detected around M94 by Zhou et al. using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). M94-CL9's HI properties as detected by FAST are consistent with a RELHIC as noted by Benitez-Llambay & Navarro. Our observations with the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) detect greater HI emission in M94-CL9 and result in HI properties that are larger (corrected velocity width, $W_{50,c,t}=35.7\pm0.6\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$; and integrated flux, $\int\mathrm{Sdv}=0.28\pm0.04\,\mathrm{Jy}\cdot\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$) than those found by Zhou et al. but that match those from the FAST All-Sky HI (FASHI) survey. These larger properties do not preclude M94-CL9 from being a RELHIC, but the wider spectral extent and spectral asymmetry reported here may be in tension with predictions of RELHIC properties.
#### Combined magnetic field evolution in neutron star cores and crusts:  Ambipolar diffusion, Hall effect and Ohmic dissipation

 - **Subjects:** High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08979
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08979
 - **Abstract**
 Neutron star magnetic field evolution is mediated through the Hall effect and Ohmic dissipation in the crust while ambipolar diffusion is taking place in the core. These effects have been studied in detail in either part of the star, however, their combined, simultaneous evolution and interplay has not been explored in detail yet. Here, we present simulation results of the simultaneous evolution of the magnetic field in the core due to ambipolar diffusion and the crust due to Hall effect and Ohmic decay, under the assumption of axial symmetry. We find that a purely poloidal field generates a toroidal field in the crust, due to the Hall effect, that sinks into the core. A purely toroidal field remains toroidal and spreads into the core and the crust. Finally, for a mixed poloidal-toroidal field, the north-south symmetry is broken due to the Hall effect in the crust, however, ambipolar diffusion, tends to restore it. We examine the role of ambipolar diffusion to the magnetic field decay and we compare the rate of the conversion of magnetic field energy into heat, finding that it enhances the magnetic field decay in neutron stars.
#### The Influence of Stellar Rotation in Binary Systems on Core-Collapse  Supernova Progenitors and Multi-messenger Signals

 - **Abstract**
 The detailed structure of core-collapse supernova progenitors is crucial for studying supernova explosion engines and the corresponding multimessenger signals. In this paper, we investigate the influence of stellar rotation on binary systems consisting of a 30 solar mass donor star and a 20 solar mass accretor using the MESA stellar evolution code. We find that through mass transfer in binary systems, fast-rotating red- and blue-supergiant progenitors can be formed within a certain range of initial orbital periods, albeit the correlation is not linear. We also find that even with the same initial mass ratio of the binary system, the resulting final masses of the collapsars, the iron core masses, the compactness parameters, and the final rotational rates can vary widely and are sensitive to the initial orbital periods. For instance, the progenitors with strong convection form a thinner Si-shell and a wider O-shell compared to those in single-star systems. In addition, we conduct two-dimensional self-consistent core-collapse supernova simulations with neutrino transport for these rotating progenitors derived from binary stellar evolution. We find that the neutrino and gravitational-wave signatures of these binary progenitors could exhibit significant variations. Progenitors with larger compactness parameters produce more massive proto-neutron stars, have higher mass-accretion rates, and emit brighter neutrino luminosity and louder gravitational emissions. Finally, we observe stellar-mass black hole formation in some of our failed exploding models.
#### Motion of Planetesimals in the Hill Sphere of the Star Proxima Centauri
 - **Authors:** S. I. Ipatov

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09086
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09086
 - **Abstract**
 The motion of planetesimals initially located in the feeding zone of the planet Proxima Centauri c, at distances of 500 AU from the star to the star's Hill sphere radius of 1200 AU was considered. In the analyzed non-gaseous model, the primary ejection of planetesimals from most of the feeding zone of an almost formed planet c to distances greater than 500 AU from the star occurred during the first 10 million years. Only for planetesimals originally located at the edges of the planet's feeding zone, the fraction of planetesimals that first reached 500 AU over the time greater than 10 million years was more than half. Some planetesimals could reach the outer part of the star's Hill sphere over hundreds of millions of years. Most of the planetesimals that first reached 500 AU from Proxima Centauri first reached 1200 AU from the star in less than 1 million years. In the considered model, the disk of planetesimals in the outer part of the star's Hill sphere was rather flat. The results may be of interest for understanding the motion of bodies in other exoplanetary systems, especially those with a single dominant planet. The strongly inclined orbits of bodies in the outer part of Proxima Centauri's Hill sphere can primarily result from bodies that entered the Hill sphere from outside. The radius of Proxima Centauri's Hill sphere is an order of magnitude smaller than the radius of the outer boundary of the Hills cloud in the Solar System and two orders of magnitude smaller than the radius of the Sun's Hill sphere. Therefore, it is difficult to expect the existence of a similarly massive cloud around this star as the Oort cloud around the Sun.
#### Numerical simulations of turbulence in prominence threads induced by  torsional oscillations

 - **Abstract**
 Threads are the main constituents of prominences and are subjected to oscillations that might be interpreted as MHD waves. Moreover, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) has been reported in prominences. Both waves and KHI may affect the thermodynamic state of the threads. We investigate the triggering of turbulence in a thread caused by the nonlinear evolution of standing torsional Alfv\'en waves as well as possible observational signatures of this dynamics and the plasma heating. We modeled the thread as a radially and longitudinally nonuniform cylindrical flux tube with a uniform axial magnetic field embedded in a coronal environment. We perturbed the flux tube with the longitudinally fundamental mode of standing torsional Alfv\'en waves and numerically solved the 3D MHD equations to study the temporal evolution in both ideal and dissipative scenarios. We also performed forward modeling to calculate the synthetic H{\alpha} imaging. Standing torsional Alfv\'en waves undergo phase-mixing owing to the radially nonuniform density. The phase-mixing generates azimuthal shear flows that eventually trigger the KHI and, later, turbulence. If nonideal effects are included, plasma heating is localized in an annulus region at the thread boundary and does not increase the temperature in the cool core. Instead, the average temperature in the thread decreases owing to the mixing of internal and external plasmas. In the synthetic observations, first we find periodic pulsations in the H{\alpha} intensity caused by the integration of the phase-mixing flows along the line of sight. Later, we find fine strands that may be associated with the KHI vortices. Turbulence can be generated by standing torsional Alfv\'en waves in a thread after the onset of KHI, but this mechanism is not enough to heat globally the structure. The dynamics could be seen in high-resolution H{\alpha} observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We aimed to measure the CMF in the evolved W33-Main star-forming protocluster to compare it with CMF recently obtained in other Galactic star-forming regions, including the ones included in the ALMA-IMF program. We used observations from the ALMA-IMF large program: 2'x2' maps of emission from the continuum and selected lines at 1.3mm and 3mm observed by the ALMA 12m only antennas. Our angular resolution was typically 1'', that is 2400au at a distance of 2.4kpc. The lines we analysed are CO(2-1), SiO(5-4), N2H+(1-0), H41alpha as well as He41alpha blended with C41alpha. We built a census of dense cores in the region, and we measured the associated CMF based on a core-dependent temperature value. We confirmed the 'evolved' status of W33-Main by identifiying three HII regions within the field, and to a lesser extent based on the number and extension of N2H+ filaments. We produced a filtered core catalog of 94 candidates, that we refined to take into account the contamination of the continuum by free-free and line emission, obtaining 80 cores with masses that range from 0.03 to 13.2Msun. We fitted the resulting high-mass end of the CMF with a single power law of the form N(log(M)) ~ M^alpha, obtaining alpha = -1.44(+0.16)(-0.22), slightly steeper but consistent with the Salpeter index. We categorized our cores in pre- and protostellar, mostly based on outlow activity and hot core nature. We found the prestellar CMF to be steeper than a Salpeter-like distribution, and the protostellar CMF to be slightly top heavy. We found a higher proportion of cores within the HII regions and their surroundings than in the rest of the field. We also found that the cores' masses were rather low (maximum mass of 13Msun).
#### The Role of Drag and Gravity on Dust Concentration in a Gravitationally  Unstable Disc

 - **Abstract**
 We carry out three dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to study the role of gravitational and drag forces on the concentration of large dust grains (St > 1) in the spiral arms of gravitationally unstable protoplanetary discs, and the resulting implications for planet formation. We find that both drag and gravity play an important role in the evolution of large dust grains. If we include both, grains that would otherwise be partially decoupled will become well coupled and trace the spirals. For the dust grains most influenced by drag (with Stokes numbers near unity), the dust disc quickly becomes gravitationally unstable and rapidly forms clumps with masses between 0.15 - 6 Earth masses. A large fraction of clumps are below the threshold where runaway gas accretion can occur. However, if dust self-gravity is neglected, the dust is unable to form clumps, despite still becoming trapped in the gas spirals. When large dust grains are unable to feel either gas gravity or drag, the dust is unable to trace the gas spirals. Hence, full physics is needed to properly simulate dust in gravitationally unstable discs. Dust trapping of large grains in spiral arms of discs stable to gas fragmentation could explain planet formation in very young discs by a population of planetesimals formed due to the combined roles of drag and gravity in the earliest stages of a disc's evolution. Furthermore, it highlights that gravitationally unstable discs are not just important for forming gas giants quickly, it can also rapidly form Earth mass bodies.
