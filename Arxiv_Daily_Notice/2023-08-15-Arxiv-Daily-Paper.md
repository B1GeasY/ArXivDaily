 - **Abstract**
 In this project, we determined the constraints on the modified tidal quality factor, $Q_{pl}'$, of gas-giant planets orbiting close to their host stars. We allowed $Q_{pl}'$ to depend on tidal frequency, accounting for the multiple tidal waves with time-dependent frequencies simultaneously present on the planet. We performed our analysis on 78 single-star and single-planet systems, with giant planets and host stars with radiative cores and convective outer shells. We extracted constraints on the frequency-dependent $Q_{pl}'$ for each system separately and combined them to find general constraints on $Q_{pl}'$ required to explain the observed eccentricity envelope while simultaneously allowing the observed eccentricities of all systems to survive to the present day. Individual systems do not place tight constraints on $Q_{pl}'$. However, since similar planets must have similar tidal dissipation, we require that a consistent, possibly frequency-dependent, model must apply. Under that assumption, we find that the value of $\log_{10}Q_{pl}'$ for HJs is $5.0\pm0.5$ for the range of tidal period from 0.8 to 7 days. We did not see any clear sign of frequency dependence of $Q_{pl}'$.
#### The 2023 release of Cloudy

 - **Abstract**
 We describe the 2023 release of the spectral synthesis code Cloudy. Since the previous major release, migrations of our online services motivated us to adopt git as our version control system. This change alone led us to adopt an annual release scheme, accompanied by a short release paper, the present being the inaugural. Significant changes to our atomic and molecular data have improved the accuracy of Cloudy predictions: we have upgraded our instance of the Chianti database from version 7 to 10; our H- and He-like collisional rates to improved theoretical values; our molecular data to the most recent LAMDA database, and several chemical reaction rates to their most recent UDfA and KiDA values. Finally, we describe our progress on upgrading Cloudy's capabilities to meet the requirements of the X-ray microcalorimeters aboard the upcoming XRISM and Athena missions, and outline future development that will make Cloudy of use to the X-ray community.
#### Quantum mechanical modeling of the grain-surface formation of  acetaldehyde on H$_2$O:CO dirty ice surfaces
 - **Authors:** Jessica Perrero, Piero Ugliengo, Cecilia Ceccarelli, Albert Rimola
 - **Subjects:** Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06492
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06492
 - **Abstract**
 Acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO) is one of the most detected interstellar Complex Organic Molecule (iCOM) in the interstellar medium (ISM). These species have a potential biological relevance, as they can be precursors of more complex species from which life could have emerged. The formation of iCOMs in the ISM is a challenge and a matter of debate, whether gas-phase, grain-surface chemistry or both are needed for their synthesis. In the gas-phase, CH$_3$CHO can be efficiently synthesized from ethanol and/or ethyl radical. On the grain-surfaces, radical-radical recombinations were traditionally invoked. However, several pitfalls have been recently identified, such as the presence of energy barriers and competitive side reactions (i.e., H abstractions). Here we investigate a new grain-surface reaction pathway for the formation of acetaldehyde, namely the reaction between CH$_3$ and a CO molecule of a dirty water/CO ice followed by hydrogenation of its product, CH$_3$CO. To this end, we carried out \textit{ab initio} computations of the reaction occurring on an ice composed by 75% water and 25% CO molecules. We found that the CH$_3$ + CO$_{(ice)}$ reaction exhibits barriers difficult to overcome in the ISM, either adopting a Langmuir-Hinshelwood or an Eley-Rideal mechanism. The subsequent hydrogenation step is found to be barrierless, provided that the two reacting species have the correct orientation. Therefore, this pathway seems unlikely to occur in the ISM.
#### Indirect dark matter search in the Galactic Centre with IceCube

 - **Subjects:** High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06729
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06729
 - **Abstract**
 It is assumed that dark matter can annihilate or decay into Standard Model particles which then can produce a neutrino flux detectable at IceCube. Such a signal can be emitted from the Galactic Center thanks to the high density of dark matter abundance being gravitationally captured. This analysis aims at searching for neutrino signals from dark matter annihilation and decay in the Galactic Center using $\sim$9 years of IceCube-DeepCore data with an optimized selection for low energy. In this contribution, we present the sensitivities on the thermally averaged dark matter self-annihilation cross-section for dark matter masses ranging from 5 GeV up to 8 TeV.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of transient phenomena like Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), stellar flares and explosions (novae and supernovae), combined with the detection of novel cosmic messengers like high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves has revolutionized astrophysics over the last years. The discovery potential of both ulti-messenger and multi-wavelength follow-up observations as well as serendipitous observations could be maximized with a novel tool which allows for quickly acquiring an overview over relevant information associated with each new detection. Here we present Astro-COLIBRI, a novel and comprehensive platform for this challenge. Astro-COLIBRI's architecture comprises a public RESTful API, real-time databases, a cloud-based alert system and a website as well as apps for iOS and Android as clients for users. Astro-COLIBRI evaluates incoming messages of astronomical observations from all available alert streams in real time, filters them by user specified criteria and puts them into their MWL and MM context. The clients provide a graphical representation with an easy to grasp summary of the relevant data to allow for the fast identification of interesting phenomena, provides an assessment of observing conditions at a large selection of observatories around the world, and much more. Here the key features of Astro-COLIBRI are presented. We outline the architecture, summarize the used data resources, and provide examples for applications and use cases. Focussing on the high-energy domain, we'll discuss the use of the platform in searches for high-energy gamma-ray counterparts to high-energy neutrinos, gamma-ray bursts and gravitational waves.
#### Lightcurve and spectral modelling of the Type IIb SN 2020acat. Evidence  for a strong Ni bubble effect on the diffusion time

 - **Abstract**
 We use the light curve and spectral synthesis code JEKYLL to calculate a set of macroscopically mixed Type IIb supernova (SN) models, which are compared to both previously published and new late-phase observations of SN 2020acat. The models differ in the initial mass, the radial mixing and expansion of the radioactive material, and the properties of the hydrogen envelope. The best match to the photospheric and nebular spectra and lightcurves of SN 2020acat is found for a model with an initial mass of 17 solar masses, strong radial mixing and expansion of the radioactive material, and a 0.1 solar mass hydrogen envelope with a low hydrogen mass-fraction of 0.27. The most interesting result is that strong expansion of the clumps containing radioactive material seems to be required to fit the observations of SN 2020acat both in the diffusion phase and the nebular phase. These "Ni bubbles" are expected to expand due to heating from radioactive decays, but the degree of expansion is poorly constrained. Without strong expansion there is a tension between the diffusion phase and the subsequent evolution, and models that fit the nebular phase produce a diffusion peak that is too broad. The diffusion phase lightcurve is sensitive to the expansion of the "Ni bubbles", as the resulting Swiss-cheese-like geometry decreases the effective opacity and therefore the diffusion time. This effect has not been taken into account in previous lightcurve modelling of stripped-envelope SNe, which may lead to a systematic underestimate of their ejecta masses. It should be emphasized, though, that JEKYLL is limited to a geometry that is spherically symmetric on average, and large-scale asymmetries may also play a role. The relatively high initial mass found for the progenitor of SN 2020acat places it at the upper end of the mass distribution of Type IIb SN progenitors, and a single star origin can not be excluded.
#### Dynamical characterization of the 6/1 mean motion resonance between  Quaoar's ring and Weywot
 - **Authors:** Adrián Rodríguez, Bruno Morgado, Nelson Callegari Jr

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, it has been reported the discovery of a dense ring around the trans-Neptunian object 50000 Quaoar. The ring particles seem to be very close to the 6/1 mean motion resonance with Weywot, the only known satellite in the system. In this work we investigate the dynamical environment in the close vicinity of the 6/1 orbital resonance in the context of the restricted three body problem. We aim to analyze whether, in view of observational constraints, the ring could be effectively evolving in resonant motion with the satellite. Through the technique of dynamical maps we identify and characterize the 6/1 mean motion resonance, finding that the main location of the resonance deviates by only $29$ km from the central part of the ring. This difference lies within the 3$\sigma$ confidence level, considering the uncertainties in the observational parameters. We also show that the Weywot's eccentricity plays a significant role in the dynamical structure of the 6/1 resonance. The results show that the resonance width is smaller than the estimated ring's width. Under assumption of a ring with eccentricity smaller than 0.05, clumping of test particles appears at the position of the different resonant multiplets, considering the nominal value of Weywot's eccentricity. This is in agreement with observations, which indicate that the estimated resonance width ($\leq$ 10 km) is comparable with the narrow and dense arc of material within Quaoar's ring. Our results may be an indicative that the 6/1 resonance resonance plays a key role in confining the arc ring.
