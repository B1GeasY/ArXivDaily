 - **Abstract**
 As stellar compositions evolve over time in the Milky Way, so will the resulting planet populations. In order to place planet formation in the context of Galactic chemical evolution, we make use of a large ($N = 5\,325$) stellar sample representing the thin and thick discs, defined chemically, and the halo, and we simulate planet formation by pebble accretion around these stars. We build a chemical model of their protoplanetary discs, taking into account the relevant chemical transitions between vapour and refractory minerals, in order to track the resulting compositions of formed planets. We find that the masses of our synthetic planets increase on average with increasing stellar metallicity [Fe/H] and that giant planets and super-Earths are most common around thin-disc ($\alpha$-poor) stars since these stars have an overall higher budget of solid particles. Giant planets are found to be very rare ($\lesssim$1\%) around thick-disc ($\alpha$-rich) stars and nearly non-existent around halo stars. This indicates that the planet population is more diverse for more metal-rich stars in the thin disc. Water-rich planets are less common around low-metallicity stars since their low metallicity prohibits efficient growth beyond the water ice line. If we allow water to oxidise iron in the protoplanetary disc, this results in decreasing core mass fractions with increasing [Fe/H]. Excluding iron oxidation from our condensation model instead results in higher core mass fractions, in better agreement with the core-mass fraction of Earth, that increase with increasing [Fe/H]. Our work demonstrates how the Galactic chemical evolution and stellar parameters, such as stellar mass and chemical composition, can shape the resulting planet population.

 - **Abstract**
 Protonated hydrogen cyanide, HCNH$^{+}$, plays a fundamental role in astrochemistry because it is an intermediary in gas-phase ion-neutral reactions within cold molecular clouds. However, the impact of the environment on the chemistry of HCNH$^{+}$ remains poorly understood. With the IRAM-30 m and APEX-12 m observations, we report the first robust distribution of HCNH$^{+}$ in the Serpens filament and in Serpens South. Our data suggest that HCNH$^{+}$ is abundant in cold and quiescent regions, but is deficit in active star-forming regions. The observed HCNH$^{+}$ fractional abundances relative to H$_{2}$ range from $3.1\times 10^{-11}$ in protostellar cores to $5.9\times 10^{-10}$ in prestellar cores, and the HCNH$^{+}$ abundance generally decreases with increasing H$_{2}$ column density, which suggests that HCNH$^{+}$ coevolves with cloud cores. Our observations and modeling results suggest that the abundance of HCNH$^{+}$ in cold molecular clouds is strongly dependent on the H$_{2}$ number density. The decrease in the abundance of HCNH$^{+}$ is caused by the fact that its main precursors (e.g., HCN and HNC) undergo freeze-out as the number density of H$_{2}$ increases. However, current chemical models cannot explain other observed trends, such as the fact that the abundance of HCNH$^{+}$ shows an anti-correlation with that of HCN and HNC, but a positive correlation with that of N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ in the southern part of the Serpens South northern clump. This indicates that additional chemical pathways have to be invoked for the formation of HCNH$^{+}$ via molecules like N$_{2}$ in regions in which HCN and HNC freeze out. Both the fact that HCNH$^{+}$ is most abundant in molecular cores prior to gravitational collapse and the fact that low-$J$ HCNH$^{+}$ transitions have very low H$_{2}$ critical densities make this molecular ion an excellent probe of pristine molecular gas.

 - **Abstract**
 We search for mass segregation in the intermediate-aged open cluster NGC 6819 within a carefully identified sample of likely cluster members. Using photometry from the Gaia, 2MASS, and Pan-STARRS surveys as inputs for a Bayesian statistics software suite, BASE-9, we identify a rich population of (photometric) binaries and derive posterior distributions for the cluster age, distance, metallicity and reddening as well as star-by-star photometric membership probabilities, masses and mass ratios (for binaries). Within our entire sample, we find 2781 likely cluster members and 831 binaries. We select a main-sequence 'primary sample' with 14.85 < G < 19.5 containing 1515 likely cluster members and 256 binaries with mass ratios q > 0.5, to investigate for mass segregation. Within this primary sample, we find the binary radial distribution is significantly shifted toward the cluster center as compared to the single stars, resulting in a binary fraction that increases significantly toward the cluster core. Furthermore, we find that within the binary sample, more massive binaries have more centrally concentrated radial distributions than less massive binaries. The same is true for the single stars. As the cluster has persisted through several half-mass relaxation times, and the expected mass-segregation timescale for stars in our primary sample is also significantly shorter than the cluster age, we interpret these results as strong evidence for mass segregation in the cluster. Importantly, this is the first study to investigate mass segregation of the binaries in the open cluster NGC 6819.

 - **Abstract**
 We interpret the peculiar super-solar nitrogen abundance recently reported by the James Webb Space Telescope observations for GN-z11 (z=10.6) using our state-of-the-art chemical evolution models. The observed CNO ratios can be successfully reproduced -- independently of the adopted initial mass function, nucleosynthesis yields and presence of supermassive ($>$1000$M_\odot$) stars -- if the galaxy has undergone an intermittent star formation history with a quiescent phase lasting $\sim$100 Myr, separating two strong star bursts. Immediately after the second burst, Wolf-Rayet stars (up to $120M_\odot$) become the dominant enrichment source, also temporarily ($<$1 Myr) enhancing particular elements (N, F, Na, Al) and isotopes ($^{13}$C, $^{18}$O). Alternative explanations involving (i) single burst models, also including very massive stars and/or pair-instability supernovae, or (ii) pre-enrichment scenarios fail to match the data. Feedback-regulated, intermittent star formation might be common in early systems. Elemental abundances can be used to test this hypothesis, and to get new insights on nuclear and stellar astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 Using multi-frequency Very Long Baseline Interferometer (VLBI) observations, we probe the jet size in the optically thick hard state jets of two black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) systems, MAXI J1820+070 and V404 Cygni. Due to optical depth effects, the phase referenced VLBI core positions move along the jet axis of the BHXRB in a frequency dependent manner. We use this "core shift" to constrain the physical size of the hard state jet. We place an upper limit of $0.3$\,au on the jet size measured between the 15 and 5 GHz emission regions of the jet in MAXI J1820+070, and an upper limit of $1.0$\,au between the $8.4$ and $4.8$\,GHz emission regions of V404 Cygni. Our limit on the jet size in MAXI J1820+070 observed in the low-hard state is a factor of $5$ smaller than the values previously observed in the high-luminosity hard state (using time lags between multi-frequency light curves), thus showing evidence of the BHXRB jet scaling in size with jet luminosity. We also investigate whether motion of the radio-emitting region along the jet axis could affect the measured VLBI parallaxes for the two systems, leading to a mild tension with the parallax measurements of Gaia. Having mitigated the impact of any motion along the jet axis in the measured astrometry, we find the previous VLBI parallax measurements of MAXI J1820+070 and V404 Cygni to be unaffected by jet motion. With a total time baseline of $8$ years, due to having incorporated fourteen new epochs in addition to the previously published ones, our updated parallax measurement of V404 Cygni is $0.450 \pm 0.018$\,mas ($2.226 \pm 0.091$\,kpc).
#### A Dual-Zone Diffusion Model for High Energy Emissions of the Cygnus  Cocoon

 - **Abstract**
 As one of the brightest galactic ${\gamma}$-ray sources, the Cygnus Cocoon superbubble has been observed by many detectors, such as $Fermi$-LAT, ARGO, HAWC, and LHAASO. However, the origin of $\gamma$-ray emission for the Cygnus Cocoon and the possible contribution to PeV cosmic rays are still under debate. The recent ultrahigh-energy $\gamma$-ray observations by LHAASO up to 1.4 PeV towards the direction of the Cygnus Cocoon, as well as the neutrino event report of IceCube-201120A coming from the same direction, suggest that the Cygnus Cocoon may be one of the sources of high-energy cosmic rays in the Galaxy. In this work, we propose a dual-zone diffusion model for the Cygnus Cocoon: the cocoon region and surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). This scenario can account for the $\gamma$-ray data from GeV to $\sim$ 50 TeV and agree with the one sub-PeV neutrino event result from IceCube so far. Moreover, it predict a non-negligible contribution $\gamma$-ray emission at hundreds TeV from the ISM surrounding the Cygnus Cocoon. This possible diffuse TeV-PeV gamma-ray features can be resolved by the future LHAASO observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon-deficient red giants (CDGs) are a peculiar class of stars that have eluded explanation for decades. We aim to better characterise CDGs by using asteroseismology (Kepler, TESS) combined with spectroscopy (APOGEE, LAMOST), and astrometry (Gaia). We discovered 15 new CDGs in the Kepler field, and confirm that CDGs are rare, being only $0.15\%$ of our background sample. Remarkably, we find that our CDGs are almost exclusively in the red clump (RC) phase. Asteroseismic masses reveal that our CDGs are primarily low-mass stars ($M \lesssim$ 2~M$_{\odot}$), in contrast to previous studies which suggested they are intermediate mass ($M = 2.5 - 5.0~\rm M_{\odot}$) based on HR diagrams. A very high fraction of our CDGs ($50\%$) are also Li-rich giants. We observe a bimodal distribution of luminosity in our CDGs, with one group having normal RC luminosity and the other being a factor of two more luminous than expected for their masses. We find demarcations in chemical patterns and luminosities which lead us to split them into three groups: (i) normal-luminosity CDGs, (ii) over-luminous CDGs, and (iii) over-luminous highly-polluted CDGs. We conclude that a merger of a helium white dwarf with an RGB star is the most likely scenario for the two groups of over-luminous stars. Binary mass-transfer from intermediate-mass AGB stars is a possibility for the highly-polluted over-luminous group. For the normal-luminosity CDGs, we cannot distinguish between core He-flash pollution or lower-mass merger scenarios. Due to the overlap with the CDGs, Li-rich giants may have similar formation channels.
#### How widespread are aromatic cycles in cold clouds?

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of large hydrocarbon cycles toward several cold dense clouds. We observed four sources (L1495B, Lupus-1A, L483, and L1527) in the Q band (31-50 GHz) using the Yebes 40m radiotelescope. Using the line stack technique, we find statistically significant evidence of benzonitrile (C6H5CN) in L1495B, Lupus-1A, and L483 at the 31.8 sigma, 15.0 sigma, and 17.2 sigma levels, respectively, while there is no hint of C6H5CN in the fourth source, L1527. The column densities derived are in the range (1.8-4.0)e12 cm-2, which is somewhat below the value derived toward the cold dense cloud TMC-1. When we analyse together all the benzonitrile abundances derived toward cold clouds in this study and in the literature, a clear trend emerges in which the higher the abundance of HC7N, the more abundant C6H5CN is. This indicates that aromatic cycles are specially favored in those interstellar clouds where long carbon chains are abundant, which suggests that the chemical processes that are responsible for the formation of linear carbon chains are also behind the synthesis of aromatic rings. We also searched for cycles other than benzonitrile, and found evidence of indene (C9H8), cyclopentadiene (C5H6), and 1-cyano cyclopentadiene (1-C5H5CN) at the 9.3 sigma, 7.5 sigma, and 8.4 sigma, respectively, toward L1495B, which shows the strongest signal from C6H5CN. The relative abundances between the various cycles detected in L1495B are consistent, within a factor of three, to those found previously in TMC-1. It is therefore likely that not only C6H5CN but also other large aromatic cycles are abundant in clouds rich in carbon chains.
#### Seasonal thaws under mid-to-low pressure atmospheres on Early Mars

 - **Abstract**
 Despite decades of scientific research on the subject, the climate of the first 1.5 Gyr of Mars history has not been fully understood yet. Especially challenging is the need to reconcile the presence of liquid water for extended periods of time on the martian surface with the comparatively low insolation received by the planet, a problem which is known as the Faint Young Sun (FYS) Paradox. In this paper we use ESTM, a latitudinal energy balance model with enhanced prescriptions for meridional heat diffusion, and the radiative transfer code EOS to investigate how seasonal variations of temperature can give rise to local conditions which are conductive to liquid water runoffs. We include the effects of the martian dichotomy, a northern ocean with either 150 or 550 m of Global Equivalent Layer (GEL) and simplified CO$_2$ or H$_2$O clouds. We find that 1.3-to-2.0 bar CO$_2$-dominated atmospheres can produce seasonal thaws due to inefficient heat redistribution, provided that the eccentricity and the obliquity of the planet are sufficiently different from zero. We also studied the impact of different values for the argument of perihelion. When local favorable conditions exist, they nearly always persist for $>15\%$ of the martian year. These results are obtained without the need for additional greenhouse gases (e.g. H$_2$, CH$_4$) or transient heat-injecting phenomena (e.g. asteroid impacts, volcanic eruptions). Moderate amounts (0.1 to 1\%) of CH$_4$ significantly widens the parameter space region in which seasonal thaws are possible.
#### Hierarchical Reconstruction of the Cosmic Web, The H-Spine method

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic web consists of a nested hierarchy of structures: voids, walls, filaments, and clusters. These structures interconnect and can encompass one another, collectively shaping an intricate network. Here we introduce the Hierarchical Spine (H-Spine) method, a framework designed to hierarchically identify and characterize voids, walls, and filaments. Inspired by the geometrical and dynamical constraints imposed by anisotropic gravitational collapse, the H-Spine method captures the geometry and interconnectivity between cosmic structures as well as their nesting relations, offering a more complete description of the cosmic web compared to single-scale or multi-scale approaches. To illustrate the method's utility, we present the distribution of densities and sizes of voids, walls and filaments identified in a 3-level hierarchical space. This analysis demonstrates how each level within the hierarchy unveils distinctive densities and scales inherent to cosmic web elements.
