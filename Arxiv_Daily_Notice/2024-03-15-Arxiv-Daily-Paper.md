 - **Abstract**
 This work analyses the present-day mass function (PDMF) of 93~star clusters utilizing Gaia DR3 data, with membership determined by the StarGo machine learning algorithm. The impact of unresolved binary systems on mass estimation is rigorously assessed, adopting three mass ratio profiles for correction. The PDMF is characterized by the power-law index, $\alpha$, derived through a robust maximum likelihood method that avoids biases associated with data binning. The value of $\alpha$ for stars between the completeness limited mass of Gaia with a mean 0.3 $M_\odot$ for our cluster samples and 2 $M_\odot$, exhibits stability for clusters younger than 200 Myr, decreasing for older clusters, particularly when considering stars within the half-mass radius. The PDMF of these star clusters is consistent with a dynamically evolved Kroupa IMF via the loss of low-mass stars. Cluster morphology shows a correlation with $\alpha$, as $\alpha$ values exhibit a decreasing trend from filamentary to tidal-tail clusters, mirroring the sequence of increasing cluster age. The dependence of $\alpha$ on total cluster mass is weak, with a subtle increase for higher-mass clusters, especially outside the half-mass radius. We do not observe a correlation between $\alpha$ and the mean metallicity of the clusters. Younger clusters have lower metallicity compared to their older counterparts, which indicates that the older clusters might have migrated to the solar neighbourhood from the inner disk. A comparison with numerical models incorporating a black hole population suggests the need for observations of distant, older, massive open clusters to determine whether or not they contain black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Nitrogen is produced by CNO-cycling in massive stars, and can be ejected in significant amounts in supernova explosions. While in H-rich SNe, its [\ion{N}{II}] 6548, 6583 emission becomes obscured by strong H$\alpha$, in explosions of He stars, this nitrogen emission becomes more visible. We here explore the formation of this line, using the \texttt{SUMO} code to compute spectra for a grid of 1D models with parameterized mixing informed from new 2D simulations. Because the mass fraction of nitrogen in the ejecta decreases with larger He core masses, as more of the He/N zone gets processed by shell helium burning and is lost to winds, the [\ion{N}{II}] luminosity relative to the overall optical flux probes the He core mass. By comparing to large samples of data, we find that low-mass He cores ($M_{\rm preSN}\lesssim\ 3\ M_\odot$) are exclusively associated with Type IIb SNe, with the exception of Type Ib SN 2007Y. Seeing no strong nitrogen emission in other Type Ib SNe, the implication is either an origin from low-mass stars with the He/N layer (but not the He/C) layer peeled away, or from higher-mass He cores. We also see no clear nitrogen emission in Type Ic SNe. We discuss the diagnostic potential of this new line metric, and also dependencies on mass-loss-rate and metallicity.
#### A consistent explanation for the unusual initial mass function and star  formation rate in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ)

 - **Abstract**
 We examine various physical processes that may explain the shallow high-mass slope of the IMF as well as the low SFR in star-forming molecular clouds (MCs) in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). We show that the strong tidal field and the tidal shear experienced by the CMZ have opposite effects on the collapse of density fluctuations and nearly compensate, but in any case have a negligible impact and can not explain these unusual properties. Similarly, we show that the intense magnetic field in the CMZ provides a negligible pressure support and, for the high densities at play should not modify the probability density function (PDF) of the turbulent gas flow in the clouds, thus affecting negligibly the slope of the IMF. However, we show that, in contrast to MCs in the Galactic disk, the ones in the CMZ experience only one single episode of turbulence injection at large scale, most likely due dominantly to bar gas inflow. Indeed, their rather short lifetime, due to their high mean densities, is similar to one typical turbulence crossing time. Consequently, according to the Hennebelle-Chabrier theory of star formation, within this 'single turbulence episode' scenario, the cloud experiences one single field of turbulence induced density fluctuations, leading eventually to gravitationally unstable prestellar cores. As shown in Hennebelle & Chabrier (2013}, this yields a flatter IMF than usual and leads to the correct observed slope for the CMZ star-forming clouds. Similarly, this single large scale turbulence event within the cloud lifetime yields a 5 to 6 lower SFR than under usual MW cloud conditions, again in agreement with the observed values. Therefore, we suggest that this 'single large scale turbulence injection' episode can explain both the shallow IMF high-mass slope and low SFR of clouds in the CMZ.
#### Expansion and Spectral Softening of the Dust Scattering Rings of GRB  221009A

 - **Abstract**
 Expanding X-ray halo or rings appear when short pulses of X-ray radiation from a background source are scattered by clouds of dust in the Milky Way. We study the X-ray rings of the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A, detected by the {\it Swift} X-Ray Telescope. The rings center on the GRB position and their angular radii increase with time. We identify five major expanding rings, and our modeling of their expansion history suggests that they are scattered off, respectively, from five dusty clouds at distances of 0.4-13 kpc from the observer. Given an assumed prompt X-ray fluence of this GRB, the fluxes of those rings suggest that these clouds have dust grain column densities of $10^{7\sim8}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. More interestingly, our time-dependent spectral analysis of these rings show that they all experience spectral softening, i.e., getting softer as they expand, with spectral indices ranging from 2.2 to 5, consistent with what the dust scattering model predicts.

 - **Abstract**
 Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), which postulates a breakdown of Newton's laws of gravity/dynamics below some critical acceleration threshold, can explain many otherwise puzzling observational phenomena on galactic scales. MOND competes with the hypothesis of dark matter, which successfully explains the cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure. Here we provide the first solar-system test of MOND that probes the sub-critical acceleration regime. Using the Bekenstein-Milgrom AQUAL formulation, we simulate the evolution of myriads of test particles (planetesimals or comets) born in the trans-Neptunian region and scattered by the giant planets over the lifetime of the Sun to heliocentric distances of $10^2$-$10^5$ au. We include the effects of the Galactic tidal field and passing stars. While Newtonian simulations reproduce the distribution of binding energies of long-period and Oort-cloud comets detectable from Earth, MOND-based simulations do not. This conclusion is robust to plausible changes in the migration history of the planets, the migration history of the Sun, the MOND transition function, effects of the Sun's birth cluster, and the fading properties of long-period comets. For the most popular version of AQUAL, characterized by a gradual transition between the Newtonian and MOND regimes, our MOND-based simulations also fail to reproduce the orbital distribution of trans-Neptunian objects in the detached disk (perihelion > 38 au). Our results do not rule out some MOND theories more elaborate than AQUAL, in which non-Newtonian effects are screened on small spatial scales, at small masses, or in external gravitational fields comparable in strength to the critical acceleration.
#### The Size-Linewidth Relation and Signatures of Feedback from Quiescent to  Active Star Forming Regions in the LMC

 - **Abstract**
 To investigate the effects of stellar feedback on the gravitational state of giant molecular clouds (GMCs), we study $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO ALMA maps of nine GMCs distributed throughout the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the nearest star-forming galaxy to our own. We perform noise and resolution matching on the sample, working at a common resolution of 3.5 arcseconds (0.85 pc at the LMC distance of 50 kpc), and use the \textit{SCIMES} clustering algorithm to identify discrete substructure, or "clumps." We supplement these data with three tracers of recent star formation: $8\mu$m surface brightness, continuum-subtracted H$\alpha$ flux, and interstellar radiation field energy density inferred from dust emission. The $^{12}$CO clumps identified cover a range of 3.6 dex in luminosity-based mass and 2.4 dex in average $8\mu$m surface brightness, representative of the wide range of conditions of the interstellar medium in the LMC. Our observations suggest evidence for increased turbulence in these clouds. While the turbulent linewidths are correlated with clump surface density, in agreement with previous observations, we find even better correlation with the three star formation activity tracers considered, suggesting stellar energy injection plays a significant role in the dynamical state of the clumps. The excess linewidths we measure do not appear to result from opacity broadening. $^{12}$CO clumps are found to be typically less gravitationally bound than $^{13}$CO clumps, with some evidence of the kinetic-to-gravitational potential energy ratio increasing with star-formation tracers. Further multi-line analysis may better constrain the assumptions made in these calculations.

 - **Abstract**
 The internal structure and abundance of dark matter halos and subhalos are powerful probes of the nature of dark matter. In order to compare observations with dark matter models, accurate theoretical predictions of these quantities are needed. We present a fast and accurate method to describe the tidal evolution of subhalos within their parent halo, based on a semi-analytic approach. We first consider idealized N-body simulations of subhalos within their host halo, using a generalized mass density profile that describes their properties in a variety of dark matter models at infall, including popular warm, cold, and self-interacting ones. Using these simulations we construct tidal "tracks" for the evolution of subhalos based on their conditions at infall. Second, we use the results of these simulations to build semi-analytic models (SAMs) for tidal effects, including stripping and heating and implement them within the code GALACTICUS. Our SAMs can accurately predict the tidal evolution of both cored and cuspy subhalos, including the bound mass and density profiles, providing a powerful and efficient tool for studying the post-infall properties of subhalos in different dark matter models.
