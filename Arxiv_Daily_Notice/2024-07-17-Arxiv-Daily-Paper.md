 - **Abstract**
 We analyze high-resolution hydrodynamics simulations of an isolated disk dwarf galaxy with an explicit model for unresolved turbulence and turbulence-based star formation prescription. We examine the characteristic values of the star formation efficiency per free-fall time, $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$, and its variations with local environment properties, such as metallicity, UV flux, and surface density. We show that the star formation efficiency per free-fall time in $\approx 10$ pc star-forming regions of the simulated disks has values in the range $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}\approx 0.01-0.1$, similar to observational estimates, with no trend with metallicity and only a weak trend with the UV flux. Likewise, $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ estimated using projected patches of 500 pc size does not vary with metallicity and shows only a weak trend with average UV flux and gas surface density. The characteristic values of $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}\approx 0.01-0.1$ arise naturally in the simulations via the combined effect of dynamical gas compression and ensuing stellar feedback that injects thermal and turbulent energy. The compression and feedback regulate the virial parameter, $\alpha_\mathrm{vir}$, in star-forming regions, limiting it to $\alpha_\mathrm{vir}\approx 3-10$. Turbulence plays an important role in the universality of $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$ because turbulent energy and its dissipation are not sensitive to metallicity and UV flux that affect thermal energy. Our results indicate that the universality of observational estimates of $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$ can be plausibly explained by the turbulence-driven and feedback-regulated properties of star-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive evaluation of proprietary and open-weights large language models using the first astronomy-specific benchmarking dataset. This dataset comprises 4,425 multiple-choice questions curated from the Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, covering a broad range of astrophysical topics. Our analysis examines model performance across various astronomical subfields and assesses response calibration, crucial for potential deployment in research environments. Claude-3.5-Sonnet outperforms competitors by up to 4.6 percentage points, achieving 85.0% accuracy. For proprietary models, we observed a universal reduction in cost every 3-to-12 months to achieve similar score in this particular astronomy benchmark. Open-source models have rapidly improved, with LLaMA-3-70b (80.6%) and Qwen-2-72b (77.7%) now competing with some of the best proprietary models. We identify performance variations across topics, with non-English-focused models generally struggling more in exoplanet-related fields, stellar astrophysics, and instrumentation related questions. These challenges likely stem from less abundant training data, limited historical context, and rapid recent developments in these areas. This pattern is observed across both open-weights and proprietary models, with regional dependencies evident, highlighting the impact of training data diversity on model performance in specialized scientific domains. Top-performing models demonstrate well-calibrated confidence, with correlations above 0.9 between confidence and correctness, though they tend to be slightly underconfident. The development for fast, low-cost inference of open-weights models presents new opportunities for affordable deployment in astronomy. The rapid progress observed suggests that LLM-driven research in astronomy may become feasible in the near future.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Observational evidence has accumulated in the past years, showing that the Galactic bulge includes two populations, a metal poor and a metal rich one that, in addition to a different metallicity, show different alpha over iron abundances, spatial distribution, and kinematics. While the metal rich, barred component has been fairly well characterized, the metal poor, spheroidal component has been more elusive and harder to describe. RR Lyrae variables are clean tracers of the old bulge component, and they are, on average, more metal poor than red clump stars. Aims. In the present paper, we provide a new catalog of 16488 ab type RR Lyrae variables in the bulge region within -10<l<10 and -2.8<b<2.8, extracted from multi epoch PSF photometry performed on VISTA Variable in the Via Lactea survey data. We used the catalog to constrain the shape of the old, metal poor, bulge stellar population. Methods. The identification of ab type RR Lyrae among a large sample of candidate variables of different types has been performed via a combination of a Random Forest classifier and visual inspection... [abridged] Results. We use the present catalog to derive the shape of their distribution around the Galactic Center, resulting in an elongated spheroid with projected axis ratio b/a~0.7 and inclination angle ~20 degrees. We discuss how observational biases such as errors on the distances and a non-uniform sampling in longitude, affect both the present measurements and previous ones, especially those based on red clump stars... [abridged] Conclusions. We publish a high purity RRab sample for future studies of the oldest Galactic bulge population, close to the midplane. We explore different choices for the period-luminosity-metallicity relation, highlighting how some of them introduce spurious trends of distances with either period or metallicity, or both...

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs), characterized by their luminous transients and high-velocity outflows, have emerged as plausible sources of high-energy neutrinos contributing to the diffuse neutrino. In this study, we calculate the contribution of TDEs to the diffuse neutrino by employing the outflow-cloud model within the TDE framework. Our analysis indicates that the contribution of TDEs becomes negligible when the redshift $Z$ exceeds 2. Employing a set of fiducial values, which includes outflow energy $E_{\rm kin}=10^{51}$ erg, a proton spectrum cutoff energy $E_{\rm p,max}=100$ PeV, a volume TDE rate $\dot{N}=8 \times 10^{-7}\ \rm Mpc^{-3}\ year^{-1}$, covering fraction of clouds $C_V=0.1$, energy conversion efficiency in the shock $\eta =0.1$, and a proton spectrum index $\Gamma=-1.7$, we find that TDEs can account for approximately 80\% of the contribution at energies around 0.3 PeV. Additionally, TDEs still contribute around 18\% to the IceCube data below 0.1 PeV and the total contribution is $\sim 24^{+2}_{-15}\%$. In addition, we also discuss the potential influence of various parameter values on the results in detail. With the IceCube data, we impose constraints on the combination of the physical parameters, i.e., $C_{f}=\dot{N}E_{\rm kin}C_{\rm v}\eta$. Future observations or theoretical considerations would fix some physical parameters, which will help to constrain some individual parameters of TDEs.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical accretion discs that carry a significant mass compared with their central object are subject to the effect of self-gravity. In the context of circumstellar discs, this can, for instance, cause fragmentation of the disc gas, and -- under suitable conditions -- lead to the direct formation of gas-giant planets. If one wants to study these phenomena, the disc's gravitational potential needs to be obtained by solving the Poisson equation. This requires to specify suitable boundary conditions. In the case of a spherical-polar computational mesh, a standard multipole expansion for obtaining boundary values is not practicable. We hence compare two alternative methods for overcoming this limitation. The first method is based on a known Green's function expansion (termed "CCGF") of the potential, while the second (termed "James' method") uses a surface screening mass approach with a suitable discrete Green's function. We demonstrate second-order convergence for both methods and test the weak scaling behaviour when using thousands of computational cores. Overall, James' method is found superior owing to its favourable algorithmic complexity of $\sim \mathcal{O}(n^3)$ compared with the $\sim\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ scaling of the CCGF method.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Common envelope evolution of a massive star and a neutron star companion has two possible outcomes: formation of a short-period binary (a potential gravitational wave source progenitor) or a merger of the massive star with the neutron star. If the binary merges, a structure with a neutron star core surrounded by a large diffuse envelope, a so-called Thorne-Żytkow object (TŻO), may form. The predicted appearance of this hypothetical class of star is very similar to red supergiants, making observational identification difficult. Aims. Our objective is to understand the properties of systems that are potential TŻO progenitors, e.g., binary systems that enter a common envelope phase with a neutron star companion. We also aim to distinguish those that have been through a previous stable mass transfer phase, which can rejuvenate the accretor. We estimate the number of TŻOs in the Milky Way and assess the impact of uncertainties in their formation. Methods. We use the rapid population synthesis code COMPAS at Solar metallicity and with common envelope efficiency parameter set to unity to determine the population demographics of TŻOs. We use one-dimensional evolutionary TŻO models from the literature to determine a fit for TŻO lifetime in order to estimate the current number of TŻOs in the Galaxy as well as to assess core disruption during the merger. Results. We explore the progenitors in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, calculate formation rates, and investigate kinematics of the progenitor stars. We find that the vast majority ($\approx 92\%$) of TŻO progenitors in our population have experienced mass transfer and become rejuvenated before their formation event. Using a constant star formation rate we estimate $\approx 2\times 10 ^{-4}$ TŻOs per $M_\odot$ in our Galaxy, corresponding to $\approx 5\pm 1$ TŻOs in the Milky Way at present.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Most stars form in clusters or associations but only a small number of these groups are expected to remain bound for longer than a few Myr. Once star formation has ended and the molecular gas around young stellar objects has been expelled via feedback processes, most initially bound young clusters lose the majority of their binding mass and begin to disperse into the Galactic field. Aims. This process can be investigated by analysing the structure and kinematic trends in nearby young clusters, particularly expansion, the tell-tale sign that a cluster is no longer gravitationally bound but is dispersing into the field. Methods. We combine Gaia DR3 5-parameter astrometry with calibrated radial velocities for members of the nearby young cluster {\lambda} Ori (Collinder 69). Results. We characterise the plane-of-sky substructure of the cluster using the Q-parameter and Angular Dispersion parameter. We find evidence that the cluster contains significant substructure, but that this is preferentially located away from the central cluster core, which is smooth and likely remains bound. We find strong evidence for expansion in {\lambda} Ori in the plane-of-sky using a number of metrics, but also that the trends are asymmetric at the 5{\sigma} significance level. with the maximum rate of expansion being directed nearly parallel to the Galactic plane. We then invert the maximum rate of expansion of 0.144^{+0.003}_{-0.003} kms^{-1}pc^{-1} to give an expansion timescale of 6.944^{+0.148}_{-0.142} Myr, which is slightly larger than typical literature age estimates for the cluster. We also find asymmetry in the velocity dispersion, potential signatures of cluster rotation, and calculate kinematic ages for individual cluster members by tracing their motion back in time to their closest approach to the cluster center.

 - **Abstract**
 In February 2017, the blazar OJ~287 underwent a period of intense multiwavelength activity. It reached a new historic peak in the soft X-ray (0.3-10 keV) band, as measured by Swift-XRT. This event coincides with a very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray outburst that led VERITAS to detect emission above 100 GeV, with a detection significance of $10\sigma$ (from 2016 December 9 to 2017 March 31). The time-averaged VHE $\gamma$-ray spectrum was consistent with a soft power law ($\Gamma = -3.81 \pm 0.26$) and an integral flux corresponding to $\sim2.4\%$ that of the Crab Nebula above the same energy. Contemporaneous data from multiple instruments across the electromagnetic spectrum reveal complex flaring behavior, primarily in the soft X-ray and VHE bands. To investigate the possible origin of such an event, our study focuses on three distinct activity states: before, during, and after the February 2017 peak. The spectral energy distributions during these periods suggest the presence of at least two non-thermal emission zones, with the more compact one responsible for the observed flare. Broadband modeling results and observations of a new radio knot in the jet of OJ~287 in 2017 are consistent with a flare originating from a strong recollimation shock outside the radio core.
#### Revisiting primordial magnetic fields through 21-cm physics: Bounds and forecasts

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) may significantly influence 21-cm physics via two mechanisms: (i) magnetic heating of the intergalactic medium (IGM) through ambipolar diffusion (AD) and decaying magnetohydrodynamic turbulence (DT), (ii) impact on the star formation rate density (SFRD) through small-scale enhancement of the matter power spectrum. In this analysis, we integrate both of these effects within a unified analytical framework and use it to determine upper bounds on the parameter space of a nearly scale-invariant non-helical PMF in the light of the global 21-cm signal observed by EDGES. Our findings reveal that the joint consideration of both effects furnishes constraints of the order $B_0\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ nG on the present-day magnetic field strength, which are considerably tighter compared to earlier analyses. We subsequently explore the prospects of detecting such a magnetized 21-cm power spectrum at the upcoming SKA-Low mission. For the relevant parameters of the PMF ($B_0$ and $n_{\!_{B}}$) and the excess radio background ($\xi$), SNR estimation and Fisher forecast analysis indicate that it may be possible to constrain these three parameters with relative $1\sigma$ uncertainties $\lesssim10\%$ and an associated SNR $\gtrsim10$ at SKA-Low. This also leads to possible correlations among these three parameters, thus revealing intriguing trends of interplay among the various physical processes involved.
