 - **Abstract**
 We present 500 AU and 700 AU resolution 1 mm and 3 mm ALMA observations, respectively, of protostellar cores in protoclusters Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2) North (N) and Main (M), parts of the most actively star-forming cloud in our Galaxy. Previous lower resolution (5000 AU) 3 mm observations of this region detected $\sim$150 sources inferred to be young stellar objects (YSOs) with $M>8\mathrm{\,M}_\odot$. With a tenfold increase in resolution, we detect 371 sources at 3 mm and 218 sources in the smaller field of view at 1 mm. The sources seen at low resolution are observed to fragment into an average of two objects. About a third of the observed sources fragment. Most of the sources we report are marginally resolved and are at least partially optically thick. We determine that the observed sources are most consistent with Stage 0/I YSOs, i.e., rotationally supported disks with an active protostar and an envelope, that are warmer than those observed in the solar neighborhood. We report source-counting-based inferred stellar mass and the star formation rate of the cloud: 2800$\mathrm{\,M}_\odot$, 0.0038$\mathrm{\,M}_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for Sgr B2 N and 6900$\mathrm{\,M}_\odot$, 0.0093$\mathrm{\,M}_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for Sgr B2 M respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 We present NIRSpec IFS observations of a galaxy group around the massive GS_4891 galaxy at z=3.7 in GOODS-South that includes two other two systems, GS_4891_n to the north and GS_28356 to the east. These observations, obtained as part of the GTO GA-NIFS program, allow for the first time to study the spatially resolved properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) and ionized gas kinematics of a galaxy at this redshift. Leveraging the wide wavelength range spanned with the high-dispersion grating (with resolving power R=2700) observations, covering from [OII]$\lambda$$\lambda$3726,29 to [SII]$\lambda$$\lambda$6716,31, we explore the spatial distribution of star-formation rate, nebular attenuation and gas metallicity, together with the mechanisms responsible for the excitation of the ionized gas. GS_4891 presents a clear gradient of gas metallicity (as traced by 12 + log(O/H)) by more than 0.2dex from the south-east (where a star-forming clump is identified) to the north-west. The gas metallicity in the less-massive northern system, GS_4891_n, is also higher by 0.2 dex than at the center of GS_4891, suggesting that inflows of lower-metallicity gas might be favoured in higher-mass systems. The kinematic analysis shows that GS_4891 presents velocity gradients in the ionized gas consistent with rotation. The region between GS_4891 and GS_4891_n does not present high gas turbulence which, together with the difference in gas metallicities, suggests that these two systems might be in a pre-merger stage. Finally, GS_4891 hosts an ionized outflow that extends out to r_out=1.2 kpc from the nucleus and reaches maximum velocities v_out of approximately 400 km/s. Despite entraining an outflowing mass rate of M_out$\sim$2Msun/yr, the low associated mass-loading factor, $\eta$=0.05, implies that the outflow does not have a significant impact on the star-formation activity of the galaxy.
#### Explaining the Chemical Inventory of Orion KL through Machine Learning

 - **Abstract**
 The interplay of the chemistry and physics that exists within astrochemically relevant sources can only be fully appreciated if we can gain a holistic understanding of their chemical inventories. Previous work by Lee et al. (2021) demonstrated the capabilities of simple regression models to reproduce the abundances of the chemical inventory of the Taurus Molecular Cloud 1 (TMC-1), as well as provide abundance predictions for new candidate molecules. It remains to be seen, however, to what degree TMC-1 is a ``unicorn'' in astrochemistry, where the simplicity of its chemistry and physics readily facilitates characterization with simple machine learning models. Here we present an extension in chemical complexity to a heavily studied high-mass star forming region: the Orion Kleinmann-Low (Orion KL) nebula. Unlike TMC-1, Orion KL is composed of several structurally distinct environments that differ chemically and kinematically, wherein the column densities of molecules between these components can have non-linear correlations that cause the unexpected appearance or even lack of likely species in various environments. This proof-of-concept study used similar regression models sampled by Lee et al. (2021) to accurately reproduce the column densities from the XCLASS fitting program presented in Crockett et al. (2014).
#### Cannonball or Bowling Ball: A Proper Motion and Parallax for PSR  J0002+6216

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results of careful astrometric measurements of the Cannonball pulsar J0002+6216 carried out over three years using the High Sensitivity Array (HSA). We significantly refine the proper motion to $\mu=35.3\pm0.6$ mas yr$^{-1}$ and place new constraints on the distance, with the overall effect of lowering the velocity and increasing the inferred age to $47.60\pm0.80$ kyr. Although the pulsar is brought more in line with the standard natal kick distribution, this new velocity has implications for the morphology of the pulsar wind nebula that surrounds it, the density of the interstellar medium through which it travels, and the age of the supernova remnant (CTB 1) from which it originates.

 - **Abstract**
 The ALMA Survey of Star Formation and Evolution in Massive Protoclusters with Blue Profiles (ASSEMBLE) aims to investigate the process of mass assembly and its connection to high-mass star formation theories in protoclusters in a dynamic view. We observed 11 massive (Mclump>1000 Msun), luminous (Lbol>10,000 Lsun), and blue-profile (infall signature) clumps by ALMA with resolution of 2200-5500 au at 350 GHz (870 um) in continuum and line emission. 248 dense cores were identified, including 106 cores showing protostellar signatures and 142 prestellar core candidates. Compared to early-stage infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) by ASHES, the core mass and surface density within the ASSEMBLE clumps exhibited significant increment, suggesting concurrent core accretion during the evolution of the clumps. The maximum mass of prestellar cores was found to be 2 times larger than that in IRDCs, indicating evolved protoclusters have the potential to harbor massive prestellar cores. The mass relation between clumps and their most massive core (MMCs) is observed in ASSEMBLE but not in IRDCs, which is suggested to be regulated by multiscale mass accretion. The mass correlation between the core clusters and their MMCs has a steeper slope compared to that observed in stellar clusters, which can be due to fragmentation of the MMC and stellar multiplicity. We observe a decrease in core separation and an increase in central concentration as protoclusters evolve. We confirm primordial mass segregation in the ASSEMBLE protoclusters, possibly resulting from gravitational concentration and/or gas accretion.
#### Clump-scale Gas Infall in High-mass Star Formation: a Multi-transition  View with JCMT HCN (4--3) Mapping

 - **Abstract**
 Gas infall motions play a crucial role in high-mass star formation and are characterized by observable signatures in the form of blue-shifted asymmetric spectral line profiles ("blue profiles"). However, the connection between blue profiles and infall motions is unclear due to complex gas motions at parsec scales. In this study, we present the results of an HCN (4-3) mapping survey conducted with the JCMT, towards 38 massive clumps exhibiting blue profiles in HCO+ (3-2). We extract 34 HCN cores from the 38 observed fields. The core-averaged spectra show various line profiles, indicating that blue-profile HCO+ (3-2) does not guarantee the same in HCN (4-3). Through non-LTE radiation transfer calculations, we attribute the low detection rate of high-$J$ blue profiles to a combination of insufficient HCN (4-3) opacity and intricate gas motion across different density layers. The comparison between the MALT90 and BGPS line surveys highlights the importance of appropriate tracers, high spectral resolution, and column density thresholds when searching for blue profiles. We select 11 reliable infall candidates and adopt the Hill5 model to fit the infall velocity of 0.2-1.9 km/s, corresponding to 5% to 74% of free-fall velocity. Assuming a spherically collapsing model, we estimate the median and mean mass infall rates to be 4.5E-3 and 7.6E-3 Msun/year, respectively. The consistency of the mass infall rates among different transitions suggests a steady accretion process from the clump gas envelope to the inner region.
#### Point-symmetry in SNR G1.9+0.3: A supernova that destroyed its planetary  nebula progenitor

 - **Abstract**
 I analyze a new X-ray image of the youngest supernova remnant (SNR) in the Galaxy, which is the type Ia SNR G1.9+0.3, and reveal a very clear point-symmetrical structure. Since explosion models of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) do not form such morphologies, the point-symmetrical morphology must come from the circumstellar material (CSM) into which the ejecta expands. The large-scale point-symmetry that I identify and the known substantial deceleration of the ejecta of SNR G1.9+0.3 suggest a relatively massive CSM of >1Mo. I argue that the most likely explanation is the explosion of this SN Ia into a planetary nebula (PN). The scenario that predicts a large fraction of SN Ia inside PNe (SNIPs) is the core degenerate scenario. Other SN Ia scenarios might lead to only a very small fraction of SNIPs or not at all.
