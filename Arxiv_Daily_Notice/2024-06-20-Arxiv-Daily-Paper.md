 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effects of magnetic diffusion on the spectrum of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) from a cosmological perspective. To this end, we consider two modified theories of gravity (MTGs), namely, the $f(R)$ gravity and a symmetric teleparallel gravity, also known as $f(Q)$ gravity. Utilizing these two MTGs, we calculate the suppression in the flux of UHECRs for a collection of sources. Non-evolution (NE) and cosmic star formation rate (SFR) scenarios have been considered in our calculation of the suppression factor. This study also includes a mixed composition scenario involving the nuclei upto iron (Fe). Furthermore, we provide a parameterization of the suppression factor for the proton and also for the mixed compositions within the $f(R)$ and $f(Q)$ theories, considering both NE and SFR scenarios. The influence of the turbulent magnetic field on the suppression factor is also incorporated in our work. Comparative analysis of all our results with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model reveals significant effects of MTGs on the suppression factor that the $f(R)$ power-law model predicts the lowest suppression factor, while the $f(Q)$ model predicts the highest, and interestingly the results from the standard model fall within the range predicted by these two cosmological models.

 - **Abstract**
 The gas and solid-state C/O ratios provide context to potentially link the atmospheric composition of planets to that of the natal disk. We provide a synthesis of extant estimates of the gaseous C/O and C/H ratios in planet-forming disks obtained primarily through analysis of Atacama Large Millimeter Array observations. These estimates are compared to atmospheric abundances of wide separation (> 10 au) gas giants. The resolved disk gas C/O ratios, from seven systems, generally exhibit C/O > 1 with sub-solar, or depleted, carbon content. In contrast, wide separation gas giants have atmospheric C/O ratios that cluster near or slightly above the presumed stellar value with a range of elemental C/H. From the existing disk composition, we infer that the solid-state mm/cm-sized pebbles have a total C/O ratio (solid cores and ices) that is solar (stellar) in content. We explore simple models that reconstruct the exoplanet atmospheric composition from the disk, while accounting for silicate cloud formation in the planet atmosphere. If wide separate planets formed via the core-accretion mechanism, they must acquire their metals from pebble or planetesimal accretion. Further, the dispersion in giant planet C/H content is best matched by a disk composition with modest and variable factors of carbon depletion. An origin of the wide separation gas giants via gravitational instability cannot be ruled out as stellar C/O ratios should natively form in this scenario. However, the variation in planet metallicity with a stellar C/O ratio potentially presents challenges to these models.

 - **Abstract**
 We measure the high-mass stellar initial mass function (IMF) from resolved stars in M33 young stellar clusters. Leveraging \textit{Hubble Space Telescope's} high resolving power, we fully model the IMF probabilistically. We first model the optical CMD of each cluster to constrain its power-law slope $\Gamma$, marginalized over other cluster parameters in the fit (e.g., cluster age, mass, and radius). We then probabilistically model the distribution of MF slopes for a highly strict cluster sample of 9 clusters more massive than log(Mass/M$_{\odot}$)=3.6; above this mass, all clusters have well-populated main sequences of massive stars and should have accurate recovery of their MF slopes, based on extensive tests with artificial clusters. We find the ensemble IMF is best described by a mean high-mass slope of $\overline{\Gamma} = 1.49\pm0.18$, with an intrinsic scatter of $\sigma^{2}_{\Gamma} = 0.02^{+0.16}_{0.00}$, consistent with a universal IMF. We find no dependence of the IMF on environmental impacts such as the local star formation rate or galactocentric radius within M33, which serves as a proxy for metallicity. This $\overline{\Gamma}$ measurement is consistent with similar measurements in M31, despite M33 having a much higher star formation rate intensity. While this measurement is formally consistent with the canonical Kroupa ($\Gamma = 1.30$) IMF, as well as the Salpeter ($\Gamma = 1.35)$) value, it is the second Local Group cluster sample to show evidence for a somewhat steeper high-mass IMF slope. We explore the impacts a steeper IMF slope has on a number of astronomical sub-fields.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary mass transfer can occur at high rates due to rapid expansion of the donor's envelope. In the case where mass transfer is unstable, the binary can rapidly shrink its orbit and lead to a merger. In this work we consider the appearance of the system preceding merger, specifically for the case of a low-mass ($\approx 2.5$-$3~M_\odot$) helium star with a neutron star (NS) companion. Modeling the mass transfer history as well as the wind launched by super-Eddington accretion onto the NS, we find that such systems can power slowly rising transients with timescales as long as years, and luminosities of $\sim 10^{40}$-$10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ from optical to UV. The final explosion following the merger (or core-collapse of the helium star in some cases) leads to an interaction-powered transient with properties resembling Type Ibn supernovae (SNe), possibly with a bright early peak powered by shock cooling emission for merger-powered explosions. We apply our model to the Type Ibn SN 2023fyq, that displayed a long-term precursor activity from years before the terminal explosion.
#### A new lever on exoplanetary B fields: measuring heavy ion velocities

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields connect an array of planetary processes, from atmospheric escape to interior convection. Despite their importance, exoplanet magnetic fields are largely unconstrained by both theory and observation. In this Letter, we propose a novel method for constraining the B field strength of hot gas giants: comparing the velocities of heavy ions and neutral gas with high-resolution spectroscopy. The core concept of this method is that ions are directly deflected by magnetic fields. While neutrals are also affected by B fields via friction with field-accelerated ions, ionic gas should be more strongly coupled to the underlying magnetic field than bulk neutral flow. Hence, measuring the difference between the two velocities yields rough constraints on the B field, provided an estimate of the stellar UV flux is known. We demonstrate that heavy ions are particularly well suited for this technique, because they are less likely to be entrained in complex hydrodynamic outflows than their lighter counterparts. We perform a proof-of-concept calculation with Ba II, an ion whose velocity has been repeatedly measured at high confidence with high-resolution spectroscopy. Our work shows that a 10G magnetic field would produce ~ km/s ion--neutral velocity differences at a microbar, whereas a 50G magnetic field would produce ~20km/s velocity difference. With new leverage on magnetic fields, we will be able to investigate magnetic field generation in the extreme edge cases of hot gas giants, with wide-ranging consequences for planetary interior structure, dynamo theory, and habitability.

 - **Abstract**
 Young massive clusters (YMCs) are dense aggregates of young stars and are often speculated as potential precursors to globular clusters. However, the formation mechanism of massive and compact gas clumps that precede YMCs remains unknown. In this paper, we study the formation of such massive clumps via fast HI gas collisions (~100 km/s) as suggested by recent observations and their subsequent evolution into YMCs by using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulations involving self-gravity and detailed thermal/chemical processes. In particular, the impact of ionization feedback from stellar radiation is included in an approximate fashion where the temperature within the HII regions is elevated to 10,000 K, while supernova feedback is not included. We examine whether the resulting massive clumps can survive this ionization feedback and evolve into YMCs. Our simulations reveal the emergence of gas clumps that do not only possess substantial mass (~10^5 M_sun) but also sufficient compactness (~5 pc). Notably, these clumps exhibit significantly higher escape velocities compared to the sound speed of the HII region, indicating effective gravitational retention of gas against feedback-induced evaporation. Consequently, these conditions foster efficient star formation within the massive gas clumps, ultimately leading to their evolution into YMCs. We also perform simulations involving lower-velocity gas collisions, approximately 15 km/s, typical shock velocities induced by galactic superbubbles.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first spectroscopic estimates of the chemical abundance of M dwarf stars in a globular cluster (GC), namely 47 Tucanae. By exploiting NIRSpec on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) we gathered low-resolution spectra for 28 stars with masses in the range ~0.4-0.5 solar masses. The spectra are strongly affected by the H2O water vapour bands which can be used as indicators of the oxygen abundance. The spectral analysis reveals that the target stars feature a different O abundance, with a difference of ~0.40 dex between first and the most-polluted second population. The observed range is similar to that observed among red giant stars. This result reinforces previous findings based on the analysis of photometric diagrams, including the ``chromosome maps'', providing a first, and more direct, evidence of light element variations in the M dwarfs' mass regime. The observation that the multiple populations, with their variations in light elements, exhibit the same patterns from the lower main sequence all the way to the red giant branch further strengthens the notion that multiple stellar populations in globular clusters formed in a series of bursts of star formation.
#### Windows Into Other Worlds: Pitfalls in the physical interpretation of exoplanet atmospheric spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric spectroscopy provides a window into the properties of exoplanets. However, the physical interpretation of retrieved data and its implications for the internal properties of exoplanets remains nebulous. This letter addresses three misconceptions held by some atmospheric spectroscopists regarding the connection between observed chemical abundances and theory: (1) Whether atmospheric spectroscopy can provide the bulk atmospheric chemistry, (2) whether it can identify if a planet is cloudless, and (3) whether atmospheric evaporation arguments can be used to dismiss certain compositions inferred through spectroscopy. This letter concludes by exploring applications of remote sensing in the quest for the search for life outside of our solar system.
