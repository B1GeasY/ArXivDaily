#### The nature of diffuse ionised gas in star-forming galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the diffuse ionised gas (DIG) in a high-resolution simulation of an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy, incorporating on-the-fly radiative transfer and non-equilibrium thermochemistry. We utilise the Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code COLT to self-consistently obtain ionisation states and line emission in post-processing. We find a clear bimodal distribution in the electron densities of ionised gas ($n_{\rm e}$), allowing us to define a threshold of $n_{\rm e}=10\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ to differentiate DIG from HII regions. The DIG is primarily ionised by stars aged 5-25 Myr, which become exposed directly to low-density gas after HII regions have been cleared. Leakage from recently formed stars ($<5$ Myr) is only moderately important for DIG ionisation. We forward model local observations and validate our simulated DIG against observed line ratios in [SII]/H$\alpha$, [NII]/H$\alpha$, [OI]/H$\alpha$, and [OIII]/H$\beta$ against $\Sigma_{\rm H\alpha}$. The mock observations not only reproduce observed correlations, but also demonstrate that such trends are related to an increasing temperature and hardening ionising radiation field with decreasing $n_{\rm e}$. The hardening of radiation within the DIG is caused by the gradual transition of the dominant ionising source with decreasing $n_{\rm e}$ from 0 Myr to 25 Myr stars, which have progressively harder intrinsic ionising spectra primarily due to the extended Wolf-Rayet phase caused by binary interactions. Consequently, the DIG line ratio trends can be attributed to ongoing star formation, rather than secondary ionisation sources, and therefore present a potent test for stellar feedback and stellar population models.

 - **Abstract**
 The JWST has ushered in a new era in atmospheric characterisations of temperate low-mass exoplanets with recent detections of carbon-bearing molecules in the candidate Hycean world K2-18 b. We investigated JWST observations of the TOI-270 system, with two sub-Neptunes simultaneously transiting the nearby M dwarf during the visit. We report our atmospheric characterisation of the outer planet TOI-270 d, a candidate Hycean world, with JWST transmission spectroscopy using the NIRSpec G395H instrument in the 2.7-5.2 $\mu$m range, combined with previous observations obtained with the HST WFC3 spectrograph (1.1-1.6 $\mu$m). The spectrum reveals strong signatures of CH4 and CO2 at 3.8-4.9$\sigma$ and 2.9-3.9$\sigma$ confidence, respectively, and no evidence of NH3. The abundant CH4 and CO2, at ~0.1-1% mixing ratios, and the non-detection of NH3 are similar to the findings reported for K2-18 b and consistent with predictions for a Hycean world with a planet-wide ocean under a H2-rich atmosphere. We also report evidence of CS2 at a 2.3-3.0$\sigma$ confidence and a potential inference of H2O at 1.6-4.4$\sigma$, depending on the data analysis approach, and discuss possible interpretations of these results. The spectrum does not provide strong constraints on the presence of clouds or hazes in the observable atmosphere, nor any evidence for the effects of stellar heterogeneities, which is consistent with previous studies. For the smaller inner planet TOI-270 b, we find that the spectrum is inconsistent with a featureless spectrum at ~3$\sigma$, showing some preference for an H2-rich atmosphere in a super-Earth. We discuss the implications of our findings and future prospects.

 - **Abstract**
 Multimessenger signals from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are promising tools to infer the largely unknown properties of nuclear matter at densities that are presently inaccessible to laboratory experiments. The gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by BNS merger remnants, in particular, have the potential of setting tight constraints on the neutron-star equation of state (EOS) that would complement those coming from the late inspiral, direct mass-radius measurements, or ab-initio dense-matter calculations. To explore this possibility, we perform a representative series of general-relativistic simulations of BNS systems with EOSs carefully constructed so as to cover comprehensively the high-density regime of the EOS space. From these simulations, we identify a novel and tight correlation between the ratio of the energy and angular-momentum losses in the late-time portion of the post-merger signal, i.e., the "long ringdown", and the properties of the EOS at the highest pressures and densities in neutron-star cores. When applying this correlation to post-merger GW signals, we find a significant reduction of the EOS uncertainty at densities several times the nuclear saturation density, where no direct constraints are currently available. Hence, the long ringdown has the potential of providing new and stringent constraints on the state of matter in neutron stars in general and, in particular, in their cores.
#### Isles of regularity in a sea of chaos amid the gravitational three-body  problem

 - **Abstract**
 The three-body problem (3BP) poses a longstanding challenge in physics and celestial mechanics. Despite the impossibility of obtaining general analytical solutions, statistical theories have been developed based on the ergodic principle. This assumption is justified by chaos, which is expected to fully mix the accessible phase space of the 3BP. This study probes the presence of regular (i.e. non chaotic) trajectories within the 3BP and assesses their impact on statistical escape theories. Using numerical simulations, we establish criteria for identifying regular trajectories and analyse their impact on statistical outcomes. Our analysis reveals that regular trajectories occupy up to 32% of the phase space, and their outcomes defy the predictions of statistical escape theories. The coexistence of regular and chaotic regions at all scales is characterized by a multi-fractal behaviour. Integration errors manifest as numerical chaos, artificially enhancing the mixing of the phase space and affecting the reliability of individual simulations, yet preserving the statistical correctness of an ensemble of realizations. Our findings underscore the challenges in applying statistical escape theories to astrophysical problems, as they may bias results by excluding the outcome of regular trajectories. This is particularly important in the context of formation scenarios of gravitational wave mergers, where biased estimates of binary eccentricity can have significant consequences.
#### Nature vs. Nurture: Distinguishing Effects from Stellar Processing and  Chemical Evolution on Carbon and Nitrogen in Red Giant Stars

 - **Abstract**
 The surface [C/N] ratios of evolved giants are strongly affected by the first dredge-up (FDU) of nuclear-processed material from stellar cores. C and N also have distinct nucleosynthetic origins and serve as diagnostics of mixing and mass loss. We use subgiants to find strong trends in the birth [C/N] with [Fe/H], which differ between the low-$\alpha$ and high-$\alpha$ populations. We demonstrate that these birth trends have a strong impact on the surface abundances after the FDU. This effect is neglected in current stellar models, which use solar-scaled C and N. We map out the FDU as a function of evolutionary state, mass, and composition using a large and precisely measured asteroseismic dataset in first-ascent red giant branch (RGB) and core He-burning, or red clump (RC), stars. We describe the domains where [C/N] is a useful mass diagnostic and find that the RC complements the RGB and extends the range of validity to higher mass. We find evidence for extra mixing on the RGB below [Fe/H]= -0.4, matching literature results, for high-$\alpha$ giants, but there is no clear evidence of mixing in the low-$\alpha$ giants. The predicted signal of mass loss is weak and difficult to detect in our sample. We discuss implications for stellar physics and stellar population applications.
#### The cosmic-ray positron excess and its imprint in the Galactic gamma-ray  sky

 - **Abstract**
 We study the origin of the positron excess observed in the local cosmic-ray spectrum at high energies, and relate it to the cosmic rays and gamma-ray emission across the entire Galaxy. In particular, we explore the hypothesis of a single, dominant source accountable for primary electron-positron pairs. Since we are agnostic about the physical nature of the underlying source population, we consider four simple models that are representative of young pulsars, old stars (as a tracer of millisecond pulsars), and annihilating dark matter particles. In the dark matter hypothesis, we consider both a cored and a cuspy model for the halo in the Milky Way. Then, we compare the associated gamma-ray sky maps with Fermi-LAT data. The aim of this work is not to derive constraints or upper limits for the different models considered, but rather to explore the possibility, as a proof of concept, of building a self-consistent model able to explain simultaneously the origin of all cosmic-ray species, including positrons, as well as the Galactic center GeV gamma-ray emission. We find that the emission arising from pulsar wind nebulae is fairly concentrated near the mid plane, and therefore additional cosmic-ray sources must be invoked to explain the emission at the center of the Galaxy. If the local positron excess were mainly due to millisecond pulsars, inverse Compton scattering by the particles injected in the Milky Way bulge would naturally account for a non-negligible fraction of the central gamma-ray emission. The case of annihilating dark matter is very sensitive to the precise shape of the dark matter profile. The results for a standard NFW cuspy profile are above the gamma-ray measurements by as much as a factor of 2 in some regions of the Galaxy, while the results for an isothermal, cored profile are still compatible with the data. However, the cross-sections exceed the current constraints.
#### Verification of Hypervelocity Bulge Red Clump Stars

 - **Abstract**
 We verify candidate hypervelocity red clump stars located in the Galactic bulge that were selected based on the VVV and the Gaia DR2 data by Luna et al. (2019). To do so, we analyze data from the OGLE-IV survey: difference images and astrometric time series. We have data for 30 stars out of 34 hypervelocity candidates. We confirmed high proper motion of only one of these stars and find out that it is a nearby one, hence, not hypervelocity. To sum up, we do not confirm the candidate stars as hypervelocity ones. Hence, we disprove the production rate of hypervelocity red clump stars by the central supermassive black hole provided by Luna et al. (2019).
#### Dark Dragon Breaks Magnetic Chain: Dynamical Substructures of IRDC  G28.34 Form in Supported Environments

 - **Abstract**
 We have comprehensively studied the multi-scale physical properties of the infrared dark cloud (IRDC) G28.34 (the Dragon cloud) with dust polarization and molecular line data from Planck, FCRAO-14m, JCMT, and ALMA. We find that the averaged magnetic fields of clumps tend to be either parallel with or perpendicular to the cloud-scale magnetic fields, while the cores in clump MM4 tend to have magnetic fields aligned with the clump fields. Implementing the relative orientation analysis (for magnetic fields, column density gradients, and local gravity), Velocity Gradient Technique, and modified Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi analysis, we find that: G28.34 is located in a trans-to-sub-Alfv\'{e}nic environment ($\mathcal{M}_{A}=0.74$ within $r=15$ pc); the magnetic field is effectively resisting gravitational collapse in large-scale diffuse gas, but is distorted by gravity within the cloud and affected by star formation activities in high-density regions; and the normalized mass-to-flux ratio tends to increase with density and decrease with radius. Considering both the magnetic and turbulent support, we find that the environmental gas of G28.34 is in a super-virial (supported) state, the infrared dark clumps may be in a near-equilibrium state, and core MM4-core4 is in a sub-virial (gravity-dominant) state. In summary, we suggest that magnetic fields dominate gravity and turbulence in the cloud environment at large scales, resulting in relatively slow cloud formation and evolution processes. Within the cloud, gravity could overwhelm both magnetic fields and turbulence, allowing local dynamical star formation to happen.
#### The nature of the X-ray filaments around bow shock pulsar wind nebulae

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03616
 - **Abstract**
 Context. We propose that the X-ray filaments emerging from selected bow shock pulsar wind nebulae are due to a charge-separated outflow of electrons and/or positrons escaping the nebula and propagating along the local Galactic magnetic field. Aims. The X-ray brightness, length, and thickness of filaments are all accounted for if a nonresonant streaming instability is excited. Methods. This is possible if particles are released in the interstellar medium as a collimated beam, as would be expected in a reconnection region between the nebular and interstellar magnetic fields. Results. We successfully test this idea on the Guitar Nebula filament and discuss other cases. Conclusions. These filaments provide the best diagnostics available for particle escape from evolved pulsar wind nebulae, a process essential to assessing the contribution of these sources to cosmic ray positrons. The same phenomenology might govern the occurrence of TeV halos and their importance for cosmic ray transport.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The recent discovery of several ultra high-energy gamma-ray emitters in our Galaxy constitutes a significant advancement towards unveiling its most powerful accelerators and their properties. Nonetheless, in order to unambiguously locate the regions where the highest energy particles are produced and understand the responsible physical mechanisms, detailed spectral and morphological studies are required, especially given that most of the observed sources were found to be significantly extended. Aims. In these regards, pointing observations with the next-generation Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, like the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) Observatory and the ASTRI Mini-Array (ASTRI), are expected to provide significant improvements. Here we aim at identifying the most promising sources to target in future observations. Methods. To this purpose, we performed a comparative analysis of the expected performance of ASTRI and CTA, computing their differential sensitivities towards extended sources, and further explored their capabilities with respect to specific case studies, including follow-ups of existing gamma-ray source catalogs. Results. We find that almost all of the sources so far detected by LHAASO-WCDA and HGPS will be in the reach of ASTRI and CTA with 300 and 50 hours of exposure, respectively. For the highest energy emitters detected by LHAASO-KM2A, in turn, we provide the list of the most promising objects to be investigated. We further examined specific classes of sources in order to identify potentially detectable gamma-ray emitters, such as passive molecular clouds (i.e. illuminated by the cosmic-ray sea) and pulsars surrounded by a halo of runaway particles.
#### Formation of super-Mercuries via giant impacts

 - **Abstract**
 During the final stage of planetary formation, different formation pathways of planetary embryos could significantly influence the observed variations in planetary densities. Of the approximately 5,000 exoplanets identified to date, a notable subset exhibit core fractions reminiscent of Mercury, potentially a consequence of high-velocity giant impacts. In order to better understand the influence of such collisions on planetary formation and compositional evolution, we conducted an extensive set of smoothed particle hydrodynamics giant impact simulations between two-layered rocky bodies. These simulations spanned a broad range of impact velocities from one to eleven times the mutual escape velocity. We derived novel scaling laws that estimate the mass and core mass fraction of the largest post-collision remnants. Our findings indicate that the extent of core vaporization markedly influences mantle stripping efficiency at low impact angles. We delineate the distinct roles played by two mechanisms -- kinetic momentum transfer and vaporization-induced ejection -- in mantle stripping. Our research suggests that collisional outcomes for multi-layered planets are more complex than those for undifferentiated planetesimal impacts. Thus, a single universal law may not encompass all collision processes. We found a significant decrease in the mantle stripping efficiency as the impact angle increases. To form a 5 M$_{\oplus}$ super-Mercury at $45^{\circ}$, an impact velocity over 200 km s$^{-1}$ is required. This poses a challenge to the formation of super-Mercuries through a single giant impact, implying that their formation would either favor relatively low-angle single impacts or multiple
#### The Emerging Stellar Complex in Mon R2: Membership and Optical  Variability Classification

 - **Abstract**
 Monoceros R2 (Mon R2) is one of the closest large active star-forming regions. This extremely young and partially embedded region provides an excellent laboratory for studying star formation and the early evolution of young stellar objects (YSOs). In this paper, we conduct an optical study of the greater Mon R2 region. Beginning with 1690 previously identified candidate YSOs, we used 496 sources with good proper motions and parallaxes from Gaia DR3 to determine the astrometric properties for likely members of Mon R2. We then used both astrometric and photometric (isochronal and variability) criteria to determine that 308 of these stars are highly probable members. Using the same criteria, we considered a broad area search around Mon R2 in Gaia DR3, and separated candidate members from field stars. In total, we selected 651 likely new cluster members that had been missed in the previous x-ray and infrared excess selection techniques used in the past to establish cluster membership. Revised astrometric properties of the cluster were found using the combined sample of ~959 highly probable member stars. For the literature plus new candidate member list, optical light curves were compiled from the Zwicky Transient Facility. For 470 identified variable sources, we attempted classification based on the Flux Asymmetry (M) and Quasi-Periodicity (Q) metrics. We find that Mon R2 is dominated by quasi-periodic symmetric variables, with aperiodic sources also a significant population. A few tens of large-amplitude variables are identified that may be of interest for further study.
#### Surveys of clumps, cores, and condensations in Cygnus X: Temperature and  nonthermal velocity dispersion revealed by VLA NH3 observations

 - **Abstract**
 The physical properties, evolution, and fragmentation of massive dense cores (MDCs, $\sim$ 0.1 pc) are fundamental pieces in our understanding of high-mass star formation. We aim to characterize the temperature, velocity dispersion, and fragmentation of the MDCs in the Cygnus X giant molecular cloud and to investigate the stability and dynamics of these cores. We present the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations of the NH$_3$ (J,K) = (1,1) and (2,2) inversion lines towards 35 MDCs in Cygnus X, from which we calculated the temperature and velocity dispersion. We extracted 202 fragments ($\sim$ 0.02 pc) from the NH$_3$ (1,1) moment-0 maps with the GAUSSCLUMPS algorithm. We analyzed the stability of the MDCs and their NH$_3$ fragments through evaluating the corresponding kinetic, gravitational potential, and magnetic energies and the virial parameters. The MDCs in Cygnus X have a typical mean kinetic temperature T$_K$ of $\sim$ 20 K. Our virial analysis shows that many MDCs are in subvirialized states, indicating that the kinetic energy is insufficient to support these MDCs against their gravity. The calculated nonthermal velocity dispersions of most MDCs are at transonic to mildly supersonic levels, and the bulk motions make only a minor contribution to the velocity dispersion. Regarding the NH$_3$ fragments, with T$_K$ $\sim$ 19 K, their nonthermal velocity dispersions are mostly trans-sonic to subsonic. Unless there is a strong magnetic field, most NH$_3$ fragments are probably not in virialized states. We also find that most of the NH$_3$ fragments are dynamically quiescent, while only a few are active due to star formation activity.
#### A dormant, overmassive black hole in the early Universe

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have found a large number of supermassive black holes already in place in the first few hundred million years after Big Bang. The channels of formation and growth of these early, massive black holes are not clear, with scenarios ranging from heavy seeds to light seeds experiencing bursts of high accretion rate. Here we present the detection, from the JADES survey, of broad Halpha emission in a galaxy at z=6.68, which traces a black hole with mass of ~ 4 * 10^8 Msun and accreting at a rate of only 0.02 times the Eddington limit. The host galaxy has low star formation rate (~ 1 Msun/yr, a factor of 3 below the star forming main sequence). The black hole to stellar mass ratio is ~ 0.4, i.e. about 1,000 times above the local relation, while the system is closer to the local relations in terms of dynamical mass and velocity dispersion of the host galaxy. This object is most likely the tip of the iceberg of a much larger population of dormant black holes around the epoch of reionisation. Its properties are consistent with scenarios in which short bursts of super-Eddington accretion have resulted in black hole overgrowth and massive gas expulsion from the accretion disk; in between bursts, black holes spend most of their life in a dormant state.
