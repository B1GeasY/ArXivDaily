#### Quokka-based Understanding of Outflows (QED) I. Metal loading, phase  structure, and convergence testing for Solar neighbourhood conditions

 - **Abstract**
 Multiphase galactic outflows, generated by supernova feedback, are likely to be more metal-rich than the interstellar media from which they are driven due to incomplete mixing between supernova ejecta and the ambient ISM. This enrichment is important for shaping galactic metallicities and metallicity gradients, but measuring it quantitatively from simulations requires resolution high enough to resolve mass, momentum and energy exchanges between the different phases of the outflows. In this context, we present simulations of outflows, driven by SN feedback, conducted using \textsc{Quokka}, a new GPU-optimised AMR radiation-hydrodynamics code. This code allows us to reach combinations of resolution, simulation volume, and simulation duration larger than those that have previously been possible, and to resolve all gas phases from cold neutral medium, $T \sim 100$ K, to hot ionised gas, $T \gtrsim 10^7$ K. In this, a first of a series of papers exploring generation and evolution of multiphase outflows from a wide range of galactic environments and star formation rates, we quantify the extent of selective metal loading in Solar neighbourhood-like environments. We explain the selective metal loading we find as a result of the transport of metals within and between phases, a phenomenon we can study owing to the parsec-scale resolution that our simulations achieve. We also quantify the sensitivity of metal loading studies to numerical resolution, and present convergence criteria for future studies.
#### Asteroseismology of double-mode radial $δ$ Scuti stars: AE Ursae  Majoris and RV Arietis

 - **Abstract**
 We construct complex seismic models of two high-amplitude delta Sct stars, AE UMa and RV Ari, each pulsating in two radial modes: fundamental and first overtone. The models reproduce, besides the frequencies of two radial modes, also the amplitude of bolometric flux variations (the parameter f) for the dominant mode. Applying the Monte Carlo-based Bayesian analysis, we derive strong constraints, on the parameters of the model as well as on the free parameters of the theory. A vast majority of seismic models of the two stars are just at the beginning of hydrogen-shell burning and a small fraction is at the very end of an overall contraction. The stars have a similar age of about 1.6 Gyr for the hydrogen-shell burning phase. Both stars have unusual low overshooting from the convective core; about 0.02 and 0.004 of the pressure scale height for AE UMa and RV Ari, respectively. This result presumably indicates that overshooting should vary with time and scale with a decreasing convective core. The efficiency of convection in the envelope of both stars is rather low and described by the mixing length parameter alphaMLT of about 0.3-0.6. The third frequency of RV Ari, confirmed by us in the TESS photometry, can only be associated with mixed nonradial modes l=1, g4-g8 or l=2, g10-g12. We include the dipole mode into our Bayesian modelling and demonstrate its huge asteroseismic potential.
#### The Dispersion Measure Contributions of the Cosmic Web

 - **Abstract**
 The large-scale distribution of baryons is sensitive to gravitational collapse, mergers, and galactic feedback. Known as the Cosmic Web, its large-scale structure (LSS) can be classified as halos, filaments, and voids. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic sources that undergo dispersion along their propagation paths. They provide insight into ionised matter along their sightlines via their dispersion measures (DMs), and have been investigated as probes of the LSS baryon fraction, the diffuse baryon distribution, and of cosmological parameters. We use the cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG to study FRB DMs accumulated while traversing different types of LSS. We combine methods for deriving electron density, classifying LSS, and tracing FRB sightlines. We identify halos, filaments, voids, and collapsed structures along random sightlines and calculate their DM contributions. We analyse the redshift-evolving cosmological DM components of the Cosmic Web. We find that the filamentary contribution dominates, increasing from ~71% to ~80% on average for FRBs originating at z=0.1 vs z=5, while the halo contribution falls, and the void contribution remains consistent to within ~1%. The majority of DM variance originates from halos and filaments, potentially making void-only sightlines more precise probes of cosmological parameters. We find that, on average, an FRB originating at z=1 will intersect ~1.8 foreground collapsed structures, increasing to ~12.4 structures for a z=5 FRB. The impact parameters between our sightlines and TNG structures of any mass appear consistent with those reported for likely galaxy-intersecting FRBs. However, we measure lower average accumulated DMs from these structures than the $\sim90\;{\rm pc\;cm^{-3}}$ DM excesses reported for these literature FRBs, indicating some DM may arise beyond the structures themselves.
#### A theoretical approach to the complex chemical evolution of phosphorus  in the interstellar medium

 - **Abstract**
 The study of phosphorus chemistry in the interstellar medium has become a topic of growing interest in astrobiology, because it is plausible that a wide range of P-bearing molecules were introduced in the early Earth by the impact of asteroids and comets on its surface, enriching prebiotic chemistry. Thanks to extensive searches in recent years, it has become clear that P mainly appears in the form of PO and PN in molecular clouds and star-forming regions. Interestingly, PO is systematically more abundant than PN by factors typically of $\sim1.4-3$, independently of the physical properties of the observed source. In order to unveil the formation routes of PO and PN, in this work we introduce a mathematical model for the time evolution of the chemistry of P in an interstellar molecular cloud and analyze its associated chemical network as a complex dynamical system. By making reasonable assumptions, we reduce the network to obtain explicit mathematical expressions that describe the abundance evolution of P-bearing species and study the dependences of the abundance of PO and PN on the system's kinetic parameters with much faster computation times than available numerical methods. As a result, our model reveals that the formation of PO and PN is governed by just a few critical reactions, and fully explains the relationship between PO and PN abundances throughout the evolution of molecular clouds. Finally, the application of Bayesian methods constrains the real values of the most influential reaction rate coefficients making use of available observational data.
