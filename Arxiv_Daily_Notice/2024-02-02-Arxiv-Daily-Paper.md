 - **Abstract**
 The large distances travelled by neutrinos emitted from the Sun and core-collapse supernovae together with the characteristic energy of such neutrinos provide ideal conditions to probe their lifetime, when the decay products evade detection. We investigate the prospects of probing invisible neutrino decay capitalising on the detection of solar and supernova neutrinos as well as the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) in the next-generation neutrino observatories Hyper-Kamiokande, DUNE, JUNO, DARWIN, and RES-NOVA. We find that future solar neutrino data will be sensitive to values of the lifetime-to-mass ratio $\tau_1/m_1$ and $\tau_2/m_2$ of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1} - 10^{-2})$ s/eV. From a core-collapse supernova explosion at $10$ kpc, lifetime-to-mass ratios of the three mass eigenstates of $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ s/eV could be tested. After $20$ years of data taking, the DSNB would extend the sensitivity reach of $\tau_1/m_1$ to $10^{8}$ s/eV. These results promise an improvement of about $6 -15$ orders of magnitude on the values of the decay parameters with respect to existing limits.

 - **Abstract**
 Evolved cool stars of various masses are major cosmic engines, delivering substantial mechanical and radiative feedback to the interstellar medium through strong stellar winds and supernova ejecta. These stars play a pivotal role in enriching the interstellar medium with vital chemical elements that constitute the essential building blocks for forming subsequent generations of stars, planets, and potentially even life. Within the complex tapestry of processes occurring in the atmospheres of these cool and luminous stars, convection takes center stage. Convection is a non-local, complex phenomenon marked by non-linear interactions across diverse length scales within a multi-dimensional framework. For these particular stars, characterized by their considerable luminosities and extensive scale heights, convection transitions to a global scale. This transition is facilitated by transmitting radiative energy through the non-uniform outer layers of their atmospheres. To fully understand this phenomenon, the application of global comprehensive 3D radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of stellar convection is of paramount importance. We present two state-of-the-art numerical codes: CO5BOLD and Athena++. Furthermore, we provide a view on their applications as: pivotal roles in enabling a comprehensive investigation into the dynamic processes linked to convection; and critical tools for accurately modeling the emissions produced during shock breakouts in Type II-P Supernovae.
#### Reanalysis of the MACHO constraints on PBH in the light of Gaia DR3 data

 - **Subjects:** Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)

 - **Abstract**
 The recent astrometric data of hundreds of millions of stars from Gaia DR3 has allowed a precise determination of the Milky Way rotation curve up to $28$ kpc. The data suggests a rapid decline in the density of dark matter beyond $19$ kpc. We fit the whole rotation curve with four components (gas, disk, bulge and halo) and compute the microlensing optical depth to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). With this model of the galaxy we reanalize the microlensing events of the MACHO and EROS-2 Collaborations. Using their published efficiency function for the duration of their surveys, together with the rate of expected events according to the new density profile, we find that the Dark Matter halo could be composed up to 100\% of massive compact halo objects (MACHOs) for any mass between $0.001$ to $100~M_\odot$, except a narrow range around $0.3~M_\odot$, where it cannot be larger than $\sim30\%$. This result assumes that MACHOs have all the same mass. If these were distributed in an extended mass function like that of the Thermal History Model, the constraints are weakened, allowing 100\% of all DM in the form of Primordial Black Holes.
#### HAYATE: Photometric redshift estimation by hybridising machine learning  with template fitting
 - **Authors:** Shingo Tanigawa, Karl Glazebrook, Colin Jacobs, Ivo Labbe, Alex K. Qin

 - **Abstract**
 Machine learning photo-z methods, trained directly on spectroscopic redshifts, provide a viable alternative to traditional template fitting methods but may not generalise well on new data that deviates from that in the training set. In this work, we present a Hybrid Algorithm for WI(Y)de-range photo-z estimation with Artificial neural networks and TEmplate fitting (HAYATE), a novel photo-z method that combines template fitting and data-driven approaches and whose training loss is optimised in terms of both redshift point estimates and probability distributions. We produce artificial training data from low-redshift galaxy SEDs at z<1.3, artificially redshifted up to z=5. We test the model on data from the ZFOURGE surveys, demonstrating that HAYATE can function as a reliable emulator of EAZY for the broad redshift range beyond the region of sufficient spectroscopic completeness. The network achieves precise photo-z estimations with smaller errors ($\sigma_{NMAD}$) than EAZY in the initial low-z region (z<1.3), while being comparable even in the high-z extrapolated regime (1.3<z<5). Meanwhile, it provides more robust photo-z estimations than EAZY with the lower outlier rate ($\eta_{0.2}\lesssim 1\%$) but runs $\sim100$ times faster than the original template fitting method. We also demonstrate HAYATE offers more reliable redshift PDFs, showing a flatter distribution of Probability Integral Transform scores than EAZY. The performance is further improved using transfer learning with spec-z samples. We expect that future large surveys will benefit from our novel methodology applicable to observations over a wide redshift range.
#### Multiwavelength Sun-as-a-star Analysis of the M8.7 Flare on 2022 October  2 Using H$α$ and EUV Spectra Taken by SMART/SDDI and SDO/EVE

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a multiwavelength Sun-as-a-star analysis of the M8.7 flare on 2022 October 2, which were associated with a filament eruption and the following coronal mass ejection. The Sun-as-a-star analysis was performed using H$\alpha$ data taken by Solar Dynamics Doppler Imager on board the Solar Magnetic Activity Research Telescope at Hida Observatory, Kyoto University and full-disk integrated extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectra taken by the Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The Sun-as-a-star H$\alpha$ spectra showed blueshifted absorption corresponding to the filament eruption. Furthermore, the EVE O {\sc v} 629.7 {\AA} spectra showed blueshifted brightening, which can also be attributed to the filament eruption. Even when the blueshifted absorption became almost invisible in the Sun-as-a-star H$\alpha$ spectra, the O {\sc v} blueshifted brightening up to $-400$ km s$^{-1}$ was still clearly visible. This result indicates that even when the shifted components--which are expected to originate from stellar eruptions--become almost invisible in the spatially integrated stellar H$\alpha$ spectra, the erupting materials may still be present and observable in EUV spectra. Additionally, the Sun-as-a-star H$\alpha$ and O {\sc v} spectra exhibited redshifted absorption and brightening, respectively, during the decay phase of the flare. These components probably originate from the post-flare loops, providing clues for the multi-temperature nature of the post-flare loops in the spatially integrated observation. Our Sun-as-a-star results suggest that the combination of H$\alpha$ and EUV lines allows the investigation of the multi-temperature structure and temporal development of stellar active phenomena even in spatially integrated spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 Using an excursion-set approach, we revisit the initial spatial clustering of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) originating from the Hubble re-entry of large Gaussian density fluctuations in the early universe. We derive the two-point correlation functions of PBHs, properly accounting for the "cloud-in-cloud" mechanism. Our expressions naturally and intrinsically correlate the formation of pairs of PBHs, which is a key difference with the Poisson model of clustering. Our approach effectively includes short-range exclusion effects and clarifies the clustering behaviors at small scale: PBHs are anti-correlated at short distances. Using a scale-independent collapse threshold, we derive explicit expressions for the excess probability to find pairs of PBHs separated by a distance $r$, as well as the excess probability to find pairs with asymmetric mass ratio. Our framework is model-independent by construction and we discuss possible other applications.
#### Potential Vorticity of the South Polar Vortex of Venus

 - **Abstract**
 Venus' atmosphere shows highly variable warm vortices over both of the planet's poles. The nature of the mechanism behind their formation and properties is still unknown. Potential vorticity is a conserved quantity when advective processes dominate over friction and diabatic heating, and is a quantity frequently used to model balanced flows. As a step toward understanding the vortices' dynamics, we present maps of Ertel's potential vorticity (EPV) at Venus' south polar region. We analyze three configurations of the South Polar Vortex at the upper cloud level ($P\sim 240 mbar$; $z\sim 58 km$), based on our previous analyses of cloud motions and thermal structure from data acquired by the VIRTIS instrument onboard Venus Express. Additionally, we tentatively estimate EPV at the lower cloud level ($P\sim 2200 mbar$; $z\sim 43 km$), based on our previous wind measurements and on static stability data from Pioneer Venus and the VIRA model. Values of EPV are on the order of $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-8} K m^2 kg^{-1} s^{-1}$ at the upper and lower cloud levels, respectively, being 3 times larger than the estimated errors. The morphology observed in EPV maps is mainly determined by the structures of the vertical component of the relative vorticity. This is in contrast to the vortex's morphology observed in 3.8 or 5 $\mu m$ images which are related to the thermal structure of the atmosphere at the cloud top. Some of the EPV maps point to a weak ringed structure in the upper cloud while a more homogenous EPV field is found in the lower cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 The expanding ejecta of supernova remnants (SNRs) are believed to form dust in dense clumps of gas. Before the dust can be expelled into the interstellar medium and contribute to the interstellar dust budget, it has to survive the reverse shock that is generated through the interaction of the preceding supernova blast wave with the surrounding medium. The conditions under which the reverse shock hits the clumps change with remnant age and define the dust survival rate. To study the dust destruction in the SNR Cassiopeia A, we conduct magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the evolution of a supernova blast wave and of the reverse shock. In a second step we use these evolving conditions to model clumps that are disrupted by the reverse shock at different remnant ages. Finally, we compute the amount of dust that is destroyed by the impact of the reverse shock. We find that most of the dust in the SNR is hit by the reverse shock within the first 350 yr after the SN explosion. While the dust destruction in the first 200 yr is almost complete, we expect greater dust survival rates at later times and almost total survival for clumps that are first impacted at ages beyond 1000 yr. Integrated over the entire evolution of the SNR, the dust mass shows the lowest survival fraction (17 per cent) for the smallest grains (1 nm) and the highest survival fraction (28 per cent) for the largest grains (1000 nm).
#### Neutral carbon in diffuse interstellar medium: abundance matching with  H2 for DLAs at high redshifts

 - **Abstract**
 We present the study of CI/H$_2$ relative abundance in the diffuse cold neutral medium. Using the chemical and thermal balance model we calculated the dependence of CI/H$_2$ on the main parameters of the medium: hydrogen number density, metallicity, strength of the UV field, and cosmic ray ionization rate (CRIR). We show that observed relative CI and H$_2$ column densities in damped Lyman alpha systems (DLAs) at high redshifts can be reproduced within our model assuming the typically expected conditions in the diffuse cold neutral medium (CNM). Using the additional observed information the on metallicity, HI column density, and excitation of CI fine-structure levels, as well as temperature we estimated for a wide range metallicities in the CNM at high redshifts that CRIRs to be in the range from $\sim10^{-16}$ to $\rm few \times 10^{-15}\rm s^{-1}$, hydrogen number densities to be in range $\sim10 - 10^3$cm$^{-3}$, and UV field in range from $10^{-2}$ to $\rm few \times 10^2$ of Mathis field. We argue, that since the observed quantities used in this work are quite homogeneous and much less affected by the radiative transfer effects (in comparison with e.g. dissociation of HD and UV pumping of H$_2$ rotational levels) our estimates are quite robust against the assumption of the exact geometrical model of the cloud and local sources of the UV field.

 - **Abstract**
 Disequilibrium chemistry due to vertical mixing in the atmospheres of many brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets is well-established. Atmosphere models for these objects typically parameterize mixing with the highly uncertain $K_{\rm zz}$ diffusion parameter. The role of mixing in altering the abundances of C-N-O-bearing molecules has mostly been explored for solar composition atmospheres. However, atmospheric metallicity and the C/O ratio also impact atmospheric chemistry. Therefore, we present the \texttt{Sonora Elf Owl} grid of self-consistent cloud-free 1D radiative-convective equilibrium model atmospheres for JWST observations, which includes a variation of $K_{\rm zz}$ across several orders of magnitude and also encompasses sub-solar to super-solar metallicities and C/O ratios. We find that the impact of $K_{\rm zz}$ on the $T(P)$ profile and spectra is a strong function of both $T_{\rm eff}$ and metallicity. For metal-poor objects $K_{\rm zz}$ has large impacts on the atmosphere at significantly higher $T_{\rm eff}$ compared to metal-rich atmospheres where the impact of $K_{\rm zz}$ is seen to occur at lower $T_{\rm eff}$. We identify significant spectral degeneracies between varying $K_{\rm zz}$ and metallicity in multiple wavelength windows, in particular at 3-5 $\mu$m. We use the \texttt{Sonora Elf Owl} atmospheric grid to fit the observed spectra of a sample of 9 early to late T- type objects from $T_{\rm eff}=550-1150$ K. We find evidence for very inefficient vertical mixing in these objects with inferred $K_{\rm zz}$ values lying in the range between $\sim$ 10$^1$-10$^4$ cm$^2$s$^{-1}$. Using self-consistent models, we find that this slow vertical mixing is due to the observations probing mixing in the deep detached radiative zone in these atmospheres.
#### The Sonora Substellar Atmosphere Models. III. Diamondback: Atmospheric  Properties, Spectra, and Evolution for Warm Cloudy Substellar Objects

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new grid of cloudy atmosphere and evolution models for substellar objects. These models include the effect of refractory cloud species, including silicate clouds, on the spectra and evolution. We include effective temperatures from 900 to 2400 K and surface gravities from log g=3.5-5.5, appropriate for a broad range of objects with masses between 1 and 84 Jupiter masses. Model pressure-temperature structures are calculated assuming radiative-convective and chemical equilibrium. We consider the effect of both clouds and metallicity on the atmospheric structure, resulting spectra, and thermal evolution of substellar worlds. We parameterize clouds using the Ackerman & Marley (2001) cloud model, including cloud parameter fsed values from 1-8; we include three metallicities (-0.5, 0.0, and +0.5). Refractory clouds and metallicity both alter the evolution of substellar objects, changing the inferred temperature at a given age by up to 100-200 K. We compare to the observed photometry of brown dwarfs, finding broad agreement with the measured photometry. We publish the spectra, evolution, and other data products online with open access.
#### Analytical methods in Celestial Mechanics: satellites' stability and  galactic billiards

 - **Subjects:** Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00796
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00796
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, two models of interest for Celestial Mechanics are presented and analysed, using both analytic and numerical techniques, from the point of view of the possible presence of regular and/or chaotic motion, as well as the stability of the considered orbits. The first model, presented in a Hamiltonian formalism, can be used to describe the motion of a satellite around the Earth, taking into account both the non-spherical shape of our planet and the third-body gravitational influence of Sun and Moon. Using semi-analytical techniques coming from Normal Form and Nekhoroshev theories it is possible to provide stability estimates for the orbital elements of its geocentric motion. The second dynamical system presented can be used as a simplified model to describe the motion of a particle in an elliptic galaxy having a central massive core, and is constructed as a refraction billiard where an inner dynamics, induced by a Keplerian potential, is coupled with an external one, where a harmonic oscillator-type potential is considered. The investigation of the dynamics is carried on by using tools of ODEs' theory and is focused on studying the trajectories' properties in terms of periodicity, stability and, possibly, chaoticity.
#### The Energy and Dynamics of Trapped Radiative Feedback with Stellar Winds

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00797
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00797
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we explore the significant, non-linear impact that stellar winds have on H ii regions. We perform a parameter study using three-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations of wind and ultraviolet radiation feedback from a 35 Msun star formed self-consistently in a turbulent, self-gravitating cloud, similar to the Orion Nebula (M42) and its main ionizing source Theta 1 Ori C. Stellar winds suppress early radiative feedback by trapping ionizing radiation in the shell around the wind bubble. Rapid breakouts of warm photoionized gas ('champagne flows') still occur if the star forms close to the edge of the cloud. The impact of wind bubbles can be enhanced if we detect and remove numerical overcooling caused by shocks crossing grid cells. However, the majority of the energy in the wind bubble is still lost to turbulent mixing between the wind bubble and the gas around it. These results begin to converge if the spatial resolution at the wind bubble interface is increased by refining the grid on pressure gradients. Wind bubbles form a thin chimney close to the star, which then expands outwards as an extended plume once the wind bubble breaks out of the dense core the star formed in, allowing them to expand faster than a spherical wind bubble. We also find wind bubbles mixing completely with the photoionized gas when the H ii region breaks out of the cloud as a champagne flow, a process we term 'hot champagne'.
