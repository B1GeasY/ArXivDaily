 - **Abstract**
 TThe Period-Luminosity (PL) relation for Cepheid variable stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is crucial for distance measurements in astronomy. This study analyzes the impact of using the median rather than the mean on the PL relation's slope and zero point. It also examines the persistence of the break at approximately 10 days and addresses specification issues in the PL relation model. Using $VI$-band median and mean magnitudes from the OGLE-IV survey, corrected for extinction, we fit the PL relation employing robust $MM$-regression, which features a high breakdown point and robust standard errors. Statistical tests and residual analysis are conducted to identify and correct model deficiencies. Our findings indicate a significant change in the PL relation for Cepheids with periods of 10 days or longer, regardless of whether median or mean magnitudes are used. A bias in the zero point and slope estimators is observed when using median magnitudes instead of mean magnitudes, especially in the $V$-band. By identifying and correcting regression issues and considering the period break, our estimators for slope and zero point are more accurate for distance calculations. Comparative analysis of the models for each band quantifies the bias introduced by using median magnitudes, highlighting the importance of considering the Cepheids' period for accurate location measure results, similar to those obtained using mean magnitudes.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of massive objects via gravitational collapse is relevant both for explaining the origin of the first supermassive black holes and in the context of massive star formation. Here, we analyze simulations of the formation of massive objects pursued by different groups and in various environments, concerning the formation of supermassive black holes, primordial stars, as well as present-day massive stars. We focus particularly on the regime of small virial parameters, i.e., low ratios of the initial kinetic to gravitational energy, low to moderate Mach numbers, and the phase before feedback is very efficient. We compare the outcomes of collapse under different conditions using dimensionless parameters, particularly the star formation efficiency \epsilon_*, the fraction f_* of mass in the most massive object relative to the total stellar mass, and the fraction f_{\rm tot} of mass of the most massive object as a function of the total mass. We find that in all simulations analyzed here, f_{\rm tot} increases as a function of \epsilon_*, although the steepness of the increase depends on the environment. The relation between f_* and \epsilon_* is found to be more complex and also strongly depends on the number of protostars present at the beginning of the simulations. We show that a collision parameter, estimated as the ratio of the system size divided by the typical collision length, allows us to approximately characterize whether collisions will be important. We analyze the statistical correlation between the dimensionless quantities using the Spearman coefficient and confirm via a machine learning analysis that good predictions of f_* can be obtained from \epsilon_* together with a rough estimate of the collision parameter. This suggests that a good estimate of the mass of the most massive object can be obtained once the maximum efficiency for a given environment is known.

 - **Abstract**
 Comets, relics from the early solar system, consist of dust and ice. The ice sublimates as comets approach the Sun, ejecting dust from their nuclei seen as activity. Different volatiles sublimate at different Sun-comet distances and eject dust of unique sizes, structures, and compositions. In this study, we present new polarimetric observations of Oort-cloud comet C/2017 K2 (PANSTARRS) in R and I-filter domains before, during, and after its crossover of the water-ice sublimation regime at phase angles of 15.9\arcdeg, 10.5\arcdeg, and 20.0\arcdeg, respectively. Combining multiband optical imaging data covering a wide range of heliocentric distances ($\sim$14$-$2.3 au), we aim to characterize the preperihelion evolution of cometary activity as well as the properties of its coma dust. Two discontinuous brightening events were observed: at $\sim$6 au presumably associated with changes in CO-like supervolatile ice activity, and at $\sim$2.9 au when water ice took over. Particularly, the latter activation is accompanied by changes in coma morphology and color whose trends differ between the inner ($\sim$10$^3$-km) and outer ($\sim$10$^4$-km) parts of the coma. No polarimetric discontinuities on the comet were observed over the inner coma region, all epochs showing phase-angle and wavelength dependencies compatible with those of active comets observed in similar observing geometry. During this period, the underlying dust continuum overwhelmed H$\alpha$ emission at around 656.3 nm, suggesting less water ice on the comet's surface than expected. We discuss K2's coma environment by combining numerical simulations of light scattered by dust and place the observations within the context of the comet's evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 V5579 Sgr was a fast nova discovered in 2008 April 18.784 UT. We present the optical spectroscopic observations of the nova observed from the Castanet Tolosan, SMARTS and CTIO observatories spanning over 2008 April 23 to 2015 May 11. The spectra are dominated by hydrogen Balmer, Fe II and O I lines with P-Cygni profiles in the early phase, typical of an Fe II class nova. The spectra show He I and He II lines along with forbidden lines from N, Ar, S, and O in the nebular phase. The nova showed a pronounced dust formation episode that began about 20 days after the outburst. The dust temperature and mass were estimated using the WISE data from spectral energy distribution (SED) fits. The PAH-like features are also seen in the nova ejecta in the mid-IR Gemini spectra taken 522 d after the discovery. Analysis of the light curve indicates values of t$_2$ and t$_3$ about 9 and 13 days, respectively, placing the nova in the category of fast nova. The best fit cloudy model of the early decline phase JHK spectra obtained on 2008 May 3 and the nebular optical spectrum obtained on 2011 June 2 shows a hot white dwarf source with T$_{BB}$ $\sim$ 2.6 $\times$ 10$^5$ K having a luminosity of 9.8 $\times$ 10$^{36}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. Our abundance analysis shows that the ejecta is significantly enhanced relative to solar, O/H = 32.2, C/H = 15.5 and N/H = 40.0 in the early decline phase and O/H = 5.8, He/H = 1.5 and N/H = 22.0 in the nebular phase.

 - **Abstract**
 We report new radio timing solutions from a three-year observing campaign conducted with the MeerKAT and Murriyang telescopes for nine Small Magellanic Cloud pulsars, increasing the number of characterised rotation-powered extragalactic pulsars by 40 per cent. We can infer from our determined parameters that the pulsars are seemingly all isolated, that six are ordinary pulsars, and that three of the recent MeerKAT discoveries have a young characteristic age of under 100 kyr and have undergone a spin-up glitch. Two of the sources, PSRs J0040$-$7337 and J0048$-$7317, are energetic young pulsars with spin-down luminosities of the order of 10$^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. They both experienced a large glitch, with a change in frequency of about 30 $\mu$Hz, and a frequency derivative change of order $-10^{-14}$ Hz s$^{-1}$. These glitches, the inferred glitch rate, and the properties of these pulsars (including potentially high inter-glitch braking indices) suggest these neutron stars might be Vela-like repeating glitchers and should be closely monitored in the future. The position and energetics of PSR J0048$-$7317 confirm it is powering a new Pulsar Wind Nebula (PWN) detected as a radio continuum source; and similarly the association of PSR J0040$-$7337 with the PWN of Supernova Remnant (SNR) DEM S5 (for which we present a new Chandra image) is strengthened. Finally, PSR J0040$-$7335 is also contained within the same SNR but is a chance superposition. It has also been seen to glitch with a change of frequency of $10^{-2}$ $\mu$Hz. This work more than doubles the characterised population of SMC radio pulsars.

 - **Abstract**
 The intensities of the hydrogen Balmer lines of solar-like stars are investigated for stellar chromospheric activity by using the co-source spectral data of the LAMOST Low-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey (LRS) and Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey (MRS). The Balmer H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, and H$\delta$ lines in the LRS data and the H$\alpha$ line in the MRS data are analyzed. The absolute flux indexes, defined as the ratios of the absolute fluxes at the centers of the Balmer lines to the stellar bolometric flux, are employed to indicate the intensity magnitudes of the Balmer lines in response to stellar activity. The H$\alpha$ indexes derived from the LRS data and the MRS data, respectively, are calibrated to be quantitatively consistent with each other. It is found that, as the H$\alpha$ index increases, the H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, and H$\delta$ indexes first present trend of increasing and then decreasing, and finally increase synchronously with the H$\alpha$ index. The distributions of the Balmer line indexes also reveal the three distinct stages of stellar activity (normal stage, intense stage, and extremely intense stage), in which the extremely intense stage is characterized by the synchronous growth of the indexes of the four Balmer lines. The different behaviors of the H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, and H$\delta$ lines from that of the H$\alpha$ line can be interpreted by the different mechanisms by which the line-core intensities are formed, and the three distinct activity stages imply the very different magnetic field environments and physical conditions of solar-like stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Using lattice field simulations of the Abelian-Higgs model, we characterize the simultaneous emission of (scalar and gauge) particles and gravitational waves (GWs) by local string loops. We use {\it network} loops created in a phase transition, and {\it artificial} loops formed by either crossing straight-boosted or curved-static infinite strings. Loops decay via both particle and GW emission, on time scales $\Delta t_{\rm dec} \propto L^p$, where $L$ is the loop length. For particle production, we find $p \simeq 2$ for artificial loops and $p \lesssim 1$ for network loops, whilst for GW emission, we find $p \simeq 1$ for all loops. We find that below a critical length, artificial loops decay primarily through particle production, whilst for larger loops GW emission dominates. However, for network loops, which represent more realistic configurations, particle emission always dominates, as supported by our data with length-to-core ratios up to $L/r_\text{c} \lesssim 3500$. Our results indicate that the GW background from a local string network should be greatly suppressed compared to estimations that ignore particle emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular clouds are the most important incubators of young stars clustered in various stellar structures whose spatial extension can vary from a few AU to several thousand AU. Although the reality of these stellar systems has been established, the physical origin of their multiplicity remains an open question. Our aim was to characterise these stellar groups at the onset of their formation by quantifying both the number of stars they contain and their mass using a hierarchical fragmentation model of the natal molecular cloud. We developed a stochastic and predictive model that reconciles the continuous multi-scale structure of a fragmenting molecular cloud with the discrete nature of the stars that are the products of this fragmentation. This model was implemented within a gravo-turbulent fragmentation framework to analytically follow the fragmentation properties along spatial scales using an isothermal and adiabatic equations of state (EOSs). Using an adiabatic EOS we determined a characteristic spatial scale where further fragmentation is prevented, around a few tens of AU. We show that fragmentation is a self-regulated process as fragments tend to become marginally unstable following a $M \propto R$ Bonnor-Ebert-like mass-size profile. Supersonic turbulent fragmentation structures the cloud down to $R \approx 0.1$ pc, and gradually turns into a less productive Jeans-type fragmentation under subsonic conditions so hierarchical fragmentation is a scale dependant process. Our work suggests that pre-stellar objects resulting from gas fragmentation, have to progressively increase their accretion rate in order to form stars. A hierarchical fragmentation scenario is compatible with both the multiplicity of stellar systems identified in Taurus and the multi-scale structure extracted within NGC 2264 molecular cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 In the denser and colder regions of the interstellar medium (ISM), gas-phase sulfur is depleted by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude with respect to its cosmic abundance. Thus, which species are the main carriers of sulfur is an open question. Recent studies have proposed S$_n$ species as potential sulfur reservoirs. Among the various sulfur allotropes, the most stable one is the S$_8$ ring, detected in the asteroid Ryugu and Orgueil meteorite. Shorter species, namely S$_3$ and S$_4$, have been found in the comet 67P/C-G, but their presence in the ISM remains elusive. In this study, we compute the binding energies (BEs) of S$_n$ (n = 1-8) species on an amorphous water-ice surface model and analyze their infrared (IR) and Raman spectral features to provide data for their identification in the ISM. Our computations reveal that these species exhibit lower BEs than previously assumed and that their spectral features experience minimal shifts when adsorbed on water ice, because of the weak and nonspecific S$_n$-ice interactions. Furthermore, these species display very low IR band intensities and, therefore, very accurate instruments operating in the mid-IR range are required for detecting the presence of these species in dense interstellar environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Signature from Pop III massive stars of $140$--$260\,{\rm M_\odot}$ that end their lives as pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) are expected to be seen in very metal-poor (VMP) stars of ${\rm [Fe/H]}\leq -2$. Although thousands of VMP stars have been discovered, the identification of a VMP star with a PISN signature has been elusive. Recently, the VMP star LAMOST J1010+2358 was claimed to be the first star with a clear PISN signature. A subsequent study showed that ejecta from low-mass core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) can also fit the abundance pattern equally well and additional elements such as C and Al are required to differentiate the two sources. Follow-up observations of LAMOST J1010+2358 by two independent groups were able to detect both C and Al. Additionally, key odd elements such as Na and Sc were also detected whose abundances were found to be higher than the upper limits found in the original detection. We perform a detailed analysis of the newly observed abundance patterns by exploring various possible formation channels for VMP stars. We find that purely low-mass CCSN ejecta as well as the combination of CCSN and Type 1a SN ejecta can provide an excellent fit to the newly observed abundance pattern. Our results confirm earlier analysis that the newly observed abundance pattern is peculiar but has no signatures of PISN.
