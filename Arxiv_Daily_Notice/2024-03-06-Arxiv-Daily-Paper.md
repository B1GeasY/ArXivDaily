 - **Abstract**
 We present CO ($J = 1-0$) multi-line observations toward the L914 dark cloud in the vicinity of the Cygnus X region, using the 13.7 m millimeter telescope of the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO). The CO observations reveal in the L914 cloud a long filament with an angular length of $\sim 3.\!\!^\circ 6$, corresponding to approximately $\rm 50~pc$ at the measured distance of $\sim\rm 760~pc$. Furthermore, a group of hair-like striations are discovered in the two subregions of the L914 cloud, which are connected with the dense ridge of the filament. These striations display quasi-periodic characteristics in both the CO intensity images and position-velocity diagrams. Two of the striations also show increasing velocity gradients and dispersions toward the dense ridge, which could be fitted by accretion flows under gravity. Based on the $Planck$ 353 GHz dust polarization data, we find that the striations are well aligned with the magnetic fields. Moreover, both the striations and magnetic fields are perpendicular to the dense ridge, which constructs a bimodal configuration. Using the classic method, we estimate the strength of magnetic field, and further evaluate the relative importance of gravity, turbulence and magnetic field, and find that the L914 cloud is strongly magnetized. Our results suggest that magnetic fields play an important role in the formation of filamentary structures by channelling the material along the striations toward the dense ridge. The comparison between the observations and simulations suggests that striations could be a product of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) process.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational wave detectors have unveiled a population of massive black holes that do not resemble those observed in the Milky Way. They may have formed due to the evolution of massive low-metallicity stars, dynamical interactions in dense stellar environments, or density fluctuations in the very early Universe (primordial black holes). If the latter hypothesis is correct, primordial black holes should comprise from several to 100% of dark matter to explain the black hole merger rates observed by gravitational wave detectors. If such black holes existed in the Milky Way dark matter halo, they would cause long-timescale gravitational microlensing events lasting years. Here, we present the results of the search for the long-timescale microlensing events among the light curves of 78.7 million stars located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that were monitored for 20 years (2001-2020) by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey. We did not find any events with timescales longer than one year. The properties of all thirteen microlensing events with timescales shorter than one year detected by OGLE toward the LMC can be explained by astrophysical objects located either in the LMC itself or in the Milky Way disk, without the need to invoke dark matter in the form of compact objects. We find that compact objects in the mass range from $1.8 \times 10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$ to $6.3\,M_{\odot}$ cannot compose more than 1% of dark matter, and compact objects in the mass range from $1.3 \times 10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}$ to $860\,M_{\odot}$ cannot make up more than 10% of dark matter. This conclusively rules out primordial black hole mergers as a dominant source of gravitational waves.
#### Microlensing optical depth and event rate toward the Large Magellanic  Cloud based on 20 years of OGLE observations

 - **Abstract**
 Measurements of the microlensing optical depth and event rate toward the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) can be used to probe the distribution and mass function of compact objects in the direction toward that galaxy - in the Milky Way disk, Milky Way dark matter halo, and the LMC itself. The previous measurements, based on small statistical samples of events, found that the optical depth is an order of magnitude smaller than that expected from the entire dark matter halo in the form of compact objects. However, these previous studies were not sensitive to long-duration events with Einstein timescales longer than 2.5-3 years, which are expected from massive ($10-100\,M_{\odot}$) and intermediate-mass ($10^2-10^5\,M_{\odot}$) black holes. Such events would have been missed by the previous studies and would not have been taken into account in calculations of the optical depth. Here, we present the analysis of nearly 20-year-long photometric monitoring of 78.7 million stars in the LMC by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2001 through 2020. We describe the observing setup, the construction of the 20-year OGLE dataset, the methods used for searching for microlensing events in the light curve data, and the calculation of the event detection efficiency. In total, we find 16 microlensing events (thirteen using an automated pipeline and three with manual searches), all of which have timescales shorter than 1 yr. We use a sample of thirteen events to measure the microlensing optical depth toward the LMC $\tau=(0.121 \pm 0.037)\times 10^{-7}$ and the event rate $\Gamma=(0.74 \pm 0.25)\times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{star}^{-1}$. These numbers are consistent with lensing by stars in the Milky Way disk and the LMC itself, and demonstrate that massive and intermediate-mass black holes cannot comprise a significant fraction of dark matter.
#### Giant Biconical Dust Filaments in the Starburst Galaxy NGC 1808

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results from an analysis of multi-wavelength archival data on the multi-phase outflow in the starburst galaxy NGC 1808. We report the detection at 70 and 100 um of dust filaments that extend up to ~ 13 kpc from the galactic mid-plane and trace an edge-brightened biconical structure along the minor axis of the galaxy. The inner filaments are roughly co-spatial with previously identified optical dust filaments, extraplanar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission, and neutral and ionized gaseous outflows. The 70/160 um flux ratio, a proxy for dust temperature, is elevated along the edges of the cones, indicating that the dusty medium has been driven out of the central regions of these cones and possibly shock-heated by an outflow. We establish lower limits on the extraplanar dust mass and mean height above the stellar disk of log(M_d/M_sun) = 6.48 and |z| ~ 5 kpc, respectively. The energy requirement of (5.1-9.6) x 10^{56} ergs needed to lift the dusty material, assuming Milky-Way like dust-to-gas ratio, can be supplied by the current starburst, with measured star formation rate of 3.5-5.4 M_sun yr^{-1}, over a timescale of (4-26) xi^{-1} Myr, where xi is the efficiency of energy transfer. We conclude that a starburst-driven outflow is the most likely mechanism by which the dust features were formed.
#### Benchmarking the IRDC G351.77-0.53: Gaia DR3 distance, mass  distribution, and star formation content

 - **Abstract**
 While intensively studied, it remains unclear how the star formation (SF) in Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) compares to that of nearby clouds. We study G351.77-0.53 (henceforth G351), a cluster-forming filamentary IRDC. We begin by characterizing its young stellar object (YSO) content. Based on the average parallax of likely members, we obtain a Gaia distance of $\sim\,2.0\pm0.14$ kpc, resolving the literature distance ambiguity. Using our Herschel-derived N(H$_2$) map, we measure a total gas mass of 10200 M$_{\odot}$ (within 11 pc$^2$) and the average line-mass profile of the entire filament, which we model as $\lambda =~1660 (w/\rm pc )^{0.62}\,\,M_{\odot}\,\rm{pc}^{-1}$. At $w < 0.63$ pc, our $\lambda$ profile is higher and has a steeper power-law index than $\lambda$ profiles extracted in Orion A and most of its substructures. Based on the YSOs inside the filament area, we estimate the SF efficiency (SFE) and SF rate (SFR). We calculate a factor of 5 incompleteness correction for our YSO catalog relative to Spitzer surveys of Orion A. The G351 SFE is $\sim 1.8$ times lower than that of Orion A and lower than the median value for local clouds. We measure SFR and gas masses to estimate the efficiency per free-fall time, $\epsilon _{\rm ff}$. We find that $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ is $\sim$ 1.1 dex below the previously proposed mean local relation, and $\sim\,4.7\times$ below Orion A. These observations indicate that local SF-relations do not capture variations present in the Galaxy. We speculate that cloud youth and/or magnetic fields might account for the G351 inefficiency.

 - **Abstract**
 A fairly uniform cosmic-ray (CR) distribution is observed near the Sun, except in the nearby Eridu cloud, which shows an unexplained 30-50% deficit in GeV to TeV CR flux. To explore the origin of this deficit, we studied the Reticulum cloud, which shares notable traits with Eridu: a comparable distance in the low-density region of the Local Valley and a filamentary structure of atomic hydrogen extending along ordered magnetic-field lines that are steeply inclined to the Galactic plane. Using 14 years of Fermi-LAT data in the 0.16 to 63 GeV energy band, we found that the gamma-ray emissivity in the Reticulum cloud is fully consistent with the average spectrum measured in the solar neighbourhood, but this emissivity, and therefore the CR flux, is 1.57 $\pm$ 0.09 times larger than in Eridu across the whole energy band. The difference cannot be attributed to uncertainties in gas mass. Nevertheless, we find that the two clouds are similar in many respects at a parsec scale: both have magnetic-field strengths of a few micro-Gauss in the plane of the sky; both are in approximate equilibrium between magnetic and thermal pressures; they have similar turbulent velocities and sonic Mach numbers; and both show magnetic-field regularity with a dispersion in orientation lower than 10-15 degrees over large zones. The gas in Reticulum is colder and denser than in Eridu, but we find similar parallel diffusion coefficients around a few times 1e28 cm2/s in both clouds if CRs above 1 GV in rigidity diffuse on resonant, self-excited Alfv\'en waves that are damped by ion-neutral interactions. The loss of CRs in Eridu remains unexplained, but these two clouds provide important test cases to further study how magnetic turbulence, line tangling, and ion-neutral damping regulate CR diffusion in the dominant gas phase of the interstellar medium.
#### Modification to the Jeans criterion by external tides: Anisotropic  fragmentation and formation of filaments

 - **Abstract**
 The Jeans criterion sets the foundation of our understanding of gravitational collapse. Jog studied the fragmentation of gas under external tides and derived a dispersion relation $$ l' = l_{\rm Jeans} \frac{1} {(1 + \lambda_0' / 4 \pi G \rho_0)^{1/2}} \;. $$ She further concludes that the Jeans mass is $m_{\rm incorrect}'=m_{\rm Jeans} ( 1/(1 + \lambda_0' / 4 \pi G \rho_0)^{3/2})$. We clarify that due to the inhomogeneous nature of tides, this characteristic mass is incorrect. Under weak tides, the mass is $m \approx \rho\, l_1 l_2 l_3$, where the modifications to Jeans lengths along all three dimensions need to be considered; when the tide is strong enough, collapse can only occur once 1 or 2 dimensions. In the latter case, tides can stretch the gas, leading to the formation of filaments.
#### Elemental abundances in the diffuse ISM from joint FUV and X-ray  spectroscopy: iron, oxygen, carbon and sulfur

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate interstellar absorption lines along the line of sight toward the galactic low-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-2. We combine absorption line data obtained from high-resolution X-ray spectra collected with Chandra and XMM-Newton satellites, along with Far-UV absorption lines observed by the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) Instrument. Our primary objective is to understand the abundance and depletion of oxygen, iron, sulfur, and carbon. To achieve this, we have developed an analysis pipeline that simultaneously fits both the UV and X-ray datasets. This novel approach takes into account the line spread function (LSF) of HST/COS, enhancing the precision of our results. We examine the absorption lines of FeII, SII, CII, and CI present in the FUV spectrum of Cygnus X-2, revealing the presence of at least two distinct absorbers characterized by different velocities. Additionally, we employ Cloudy simulations to compare our findings concerning the ionic ratios for the studied elements. We find that gaseous iron and sulfur exist in their singly ionized forms, Fe II and S II, respectively, while the abundances of CII and CI do not agree with the Cloudy simulations of the neutral ISM. Finally, we explore discrepancies in the X-ray atomic data of iron and discuss their impact on the overall abundance and depletion of iron.

 - **Abstract**
 The mass assembly in star forming regions arises from the hierarchical structure in molecular clouds in tandem with fragmentation at different scales. In this paper, we present a study of the fragmentation of massive clumps covering a range of evolutionary states, selected from the ATLASGAL survey, using the compact configuration of the Submillimeter Array. The observations reveal a wide diversity in the fragmentation properties with about 60% of the sources showing limited to no fragmentation at the 2" scale, or a physical scale of 0.015 - 0.09 pc. We also find several examples where the cores detected with the Submillimeter array are significantly offset from the clump potential suggesting that initial fragmentation does not result in the formation of a large number of Jeans mass fragments. The fraction of the clump mass that is in compact structures is seen to increase with source evolution. We also see a significant correlation between the maximum mass of a fragment and the bolometric luminosity of the parent clump. These suggest that massive star formation proceeds through clump fed core accretion with the initial fragmentation being dependent on the density structure of the clumps and/or magnetic fields.
#### Ne22 distillation and the cooling sequence of the old metal-rich open  cluster NGC 6791

 - **Abstract**
 Recent Monte Carlo plasma simulations to study in crystallizing carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs (WDs) the phase separation of Ne22 (the most abundant metal after carbon and oxygen) have shown that, under the right conditions, a distillation process that transports Ne22 toward the WD centre is efficient and releases a considerable amount of gravitational energy that can lead to cooling delays of up to several Gyr. Here we present the first CO WD stellar evolution models that self-consistently include the effect of neon distillation, and cover the full range of CO WD masses, for a progenitor metallicity twice-solar appropriate for the old open cluster NGC 6791. The old age (about 8.5 Gyr) and high metallicity of this cluster -- hence the high neon content (about 3% by mass) in the cores of its WDs -- maximize the effect of neon distillation in the models to be compared with the observed cooling sequence. We discuss the effect of distillation on the internal chemical stratification and cooling time of the models, confirming that distillation causes cooling delays up to several Gyr, that depend in a non-monotonic way on the mass. We also show how our models produce luminosity functions (LFs) that can match the faint end of the observed WD LF in NGC 6791, for ages consistent with the range determined from a sample of cluster's eclipsing binary stars, and the main sequence turn-off. Without the inclusion of distillation the theoretical WD cooling sequences reach too faint magnitudes compared to the observations. We also propose James Webb Space Telescope observations that can independently demonstrate the efficiency of neon distillation in the interiors of NGC 6791 WDs, and help resolve the current uncertainty on the treatment of the electron conduction opacities for the hydrogen-helium envelope of the WD models.
#### Ices on pebbles in protoplanetary discs

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of solid macroscopic grains (pebbles) in protoplanetary discs is the first step toward planet formation. We aim to study the distribution of pebbles and the chemical composition of their ice mantles in a young protoplanetary disc. We use the two-dimensional hydrodynamical code FEOSAD in the thin-disc approximation, which is designed to model the global evolution of a self-gravitating viscous protoplanetary disc taking into account dust coagulation and fragmentation, thermal balance, and phase transitions and transport of the main volatiles (H$_2$O, CO$_{2}$, CH$_{4}$ and CO), which can reside in the gas, on small dust ($<1$ $\mu$m), on grown dust ($>1$ $\mu$m) and on pebbles. We model the dynamics of the protoplanetary disc from the cloud collapse to the 500 kyr moment. We determine the spatial distribution of pebbles and composition of their ice mantles and estimate the mass of volatiles on pebbles, grown dust and small dust. We show that pebbles form as early as 50 kyr after the disc formation and exist until the end of simulation (500 kyr), providing prerequisites for planet formation. All pebbles formed in the model are covered by icy mantles. Using a model considering accretion and desorption of volatiles onto dust/pebbles, we find that the ice mantles on pebbles consist mainly of H$_2$O and CO$_{2}$, and are carbon-depleted compared to gas and ices on small and grown dust, which contain more CO and CH$_4$. This suggests a possible dominance of oxygen in the composition of planets formed from pebbles under these conditions.
#### New theoretical study of potassium perturbed by He and a comparison to  laboratory spectra

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03059
 - **Abstract**
 We report on our new calculations of unified line profiles of K perturbed by He using ab initio potential data for the conditions prevailing in cool substellar brown dwarfs and hot dense planetary atmospheres with temperatures from $T_\mathrm{eff}$=500~$\ \mathrm{K}$ to 3000~$\ \mathrm{K}$. For such objects with atmospheres of H$_2$ and He, conventional laboratory absorption spectroscopy can be used to examine the line wings and test the line shape theories and molecular potentials. We find that an analytical Lorentzian profile is useful for a few cm$^{-1}$ from the line center, but not in the line wings, where the radiative transfer is a consequence of the K-He radiative collisions that are sensitive to the interaction potentials. Tables of the K--He absorption coefficients of the resonance lines allow accurate model atmospheres and synthetic spectra. For this purpose, we present new opacities from comprehensive line shape theory incorporating accurate ab initio potentials. Use of these new tables for the modeling of emergent spectra will be an improvement over previous line shape approximations based on incomplete or inaccurate potentials. We also present Lorentzian impact parameters obtained in the semi-classical and quantum theory for the K $4s-4p$ resonance line centered at 0.77~$\mu$m specifically for the line core regime.
#### Physical Properties and Kinematics of Dense Cores Associated with  Regions of Massive Star Formation from the Southern Sky

 - **Abstract**
 The results of spectral observations in the $\sim 84-92$ GHz frequency range of six objects in the southern sky containing dense cores and associated with regions of massive stars and star clusters formation are presented. The observations were carried out with the MOPRA-22m radio telescope. Within the framework of the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) approximation, the column densities and abundances of the H$^{13}$CN, H$^{13}$CO$^+$, HN$^{13}$C, HC$_3$N, c-C$_3$H$_2$, SiO, CH$_3$C$_2$H and CH$_3$CN molecules are calculated. Estimates of kinetic temperatures ($\sim 30-50$ K), sizes of emission regions ($\sim 0.2-3.1$ pc) and virial masses ($\sim 70-4600~M_{\odot}$) are obtained. The line widths in the three cores decrease with increasing distance from the center. In four cores, asymmetry in the profiles of the optically thick lines HCO$^+$(1-0) and HCN(1-0) is observed, indicating the presence of systematic motions along the line of sight. In two cases, the asymmetry can be caused by contraction of gas. The model spectral maps of HCO$^+$(1-0) and H$^{13}$CO$^+$(1-0), obtained within the framework of the non-LTE spherically symmetric model, are fitted into the observed ones. The radial profiles of density ($\propto r^{-1.6}$), turbulent velocity ($\propto r^{-0.2}$), and contraction velocity ($\propto r^{0.5}$) in the G268.42--0.85 core have been calculated. The contraction velocity profile differs from that expected both in the case of free fall of gas onto a protostar ($\propto r^{-0.5}$), and in the case of global core collapse (contraction velocity does not depend on distance). A discussion of the obtained results is provided.
#### Characterizing the 3D Structure of Molecular Cloud Envelopes in the  "Cloud Factory" Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We leverage recent numerical simulations of highly resolved star-forming regions in a Milky Way-like Galaxy to explore the nature of extended gaseous envelopes around molecular clouds. We extract a sample of two dozen star-forming clouds from the feedback-dominated suite of the "Cloud Factory'' simulations. With the goal of exploring the 3D thermal and chemical structure of the gas, we measure and fit the clouds' radial profiles in multiple tracers, including $n_{H_I}$, $n_{H_2}$, $n_{H_{tot}}$, $n_{CO}$, and gas temperature. We find that while solar neighborhood clouds recently detected via 3D dust mapping have radially symmetric, low-density envelopes that extend $\sim$ 10-15 pc, the simulated cloud envelopes are primarily radially asymmetric with low-density envelopes that extend only $\sim$ 2-3 pc. One potential explanation for the absence of extended envelopes in the simulated clouds may be the lack of magnetic fields, while a stronger local feedback prescription compared to solar neighborhood conditions may drive the radially asymmetric cloud morphologies. We make the pipeline to extract and characterize the radial profile of clouds publicly available, which can be used in complementary and future simulations to shed additional light on the key physics shaping the formation and evolution of star-forming structures in the Milky Way.
