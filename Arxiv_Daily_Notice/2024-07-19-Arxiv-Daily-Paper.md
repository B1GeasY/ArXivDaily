 - **Abstract**
 The polarization spectrum, or wavelength dependence of the polarization fraction, of interstellar dust emission provides important insights into the grain alignment mechanism of interstellar dust grains. We investigate the far-infrared polarization spectrum of a realistic simulated high-mass star forming cloud under various models of grain alignment and emission. We find that neither a homogeneous grain alignment model nor a grain alignment model that includes collisional dealignment is able to produce the falling spectrum seen in observations. On the other hand, we find that a grain alignment model with grain alignment efficiency dependent on local temperature is capable of producing a falling spectrum that is in qualitative agreement with observations of OMC-1. For the model most in agreement with OMC-1, we find no correlation between temperature and the slope of the polarization spectrum. However, we do find a positive correlation between column density and the slope of the polarization spectrum. We suggest this latter correlation to be the result of wavelength-dependent polarization by absorption.

 - **Abstract**
 We combine a new Galactic plane survey of Hydrogen Radio Recombination Lines (RRLs) with far-infrared (FIR) surveys of ionized Nitrogen, N+, to determine Nitrogen abundance across Galactic radius. RRLs were observed with NASA DSS-43 70m antenna and the Green Bank Telescope in 108 lines-of-sight spanning -135 degrees < l < 60 degrees, at b=0 degrees. These positions were also observed in [N II] 122 um and 205 um lines with the Herschel Space Observatory. Combining RRL and [N II] 122 um and 205 um observations in 41 of 108 samples with high signal-to-noise ratio, we studied ionized Nitrogen abundance distribution across Galactocentric distances of 0-8 kpc. Combined with existing Solar neighborhood and Outer galaxy N/H abundance determinations, we studied this quantity's distribution within the Milky Way's inner 17 kpc for the first time. We found a Nitrogen abundance gradient extending from Galactocentric radii of 4-17 kpc in the Galactic plane, while within 0-4 kpc, the N/H distribution remained flat. The gradient observed at large Galactocentric distances supports inside-out galaxy growth with the additional steepening resulting from variable star formation efficiency and/or radial flows in the Galactic disk, while the inner 4 kpc flattening, coinciding with the Galactic bar's onset, may be linked to radial flows induced by the bar potential. Using SOFIA/FIFI-LS and Herschel/PACS, we observed the [N III] 57 um line to trace doubly ionized gas contribution in a sub-sample of sightlines. We found negligible N++ contributions along these sightlines, suggesting mostly singly ionized Nitrogen originating from low ionization H II region outskirts.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years a number of surveys and telescopes have observed the plane-of-sky component of magnetic fields associated with molecular clouds. However, observations of their line-of-sight magnetic field remain limited. To address this issue, Tahani et al. (2018) developed a technique based on Faraday rotation. The technique incorporates an ON-OFF approach to identify the rotation measure induced by the magnetic fields associated with the cloud. The upcoming abundance of Faraday rotation observations from the Square Kilometer Array and its pathfinders necessitates robustly-tested software to automatically obtain line-of-sight magnetic fields of molecular clouds. We developed software, called MC-BLOS (Molecular Cloud Line-of-Sight Magnetic Field), to carry out the technique in an automated manner. The software's input are Faraday rotation of point sources (extra-galactic sources or pulsars), extinction or column density maps, chemical evolution code results, and a text/CSV file, which allows the user to specify the cloud name or other parameters pertaining to the technique. For each cloud, the software invokes a set of predefined initial parameters such as density, temperature, and surrounding boundary, which the user can modify. The software then runs the technique automatically, outputting line-of-sight magnetic field maps and tables (including uncertainties) at the end of the process. This automated approach significantly reduces analysis time compared to manual methods. We have tested the software on previously-published clouds, and the results are consistent within the reported uncertainty range. This software will facilitate the analysis of forthcoming Faraday rotation observations, enabling a better understanding of the role of magnetic fields in molecular cloud dynamics and star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The QCD axion and axion-like particles are compelling candidates for galactic dark matter. Theoretically, axions can convert into photons in the presence of a strong external magnetic field, which means it is possible to search for them experimentally. One approach is to use radio telescopes with high-resolution spectrometers to look for axion-photon conversion in the magnetospheres of neutron stars. In this paper, we describe the results obtained using a novel approach where we used the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to search for radio transients produced by collisions between neutron stars and dark matter clumps known as axion miniclusters. We used the VErsatile GBT Astronomical Spectrometer (VEGAS) and the X-band receiver (8 to 10 GHz) to observe the core of Andromeda. Our measurements are sensitive to axions with masses between 33 and 42 $\mu$eV with $\Delta$$m_a$ = 3.8$\times10^{-4}$ $\mu$eV. This paper gives a description of the search method we developed, including observation and analysis strategies. Given our analysis algorithm choices and the instrument sensitivity ($\sim$2 mJy in each spectral channel), we did not find any candidate signals greater than 5$\sigma$. We are currently implementing this search method in other spectral bands.
#### The prospect of confining the equation of state of neutron star with future mass and radius measurement

 - **Abstract**
 Simultaneous measurement of mass and radius with high precision is essential to unravel the equation of state of matter at the centre of neutron stars. Measurement of massive pulsars indicates that the equation of state has to be stiff at low densities. The radius measurement of PSR J0030+0451 has rejected several relatively softer equations of state. In this work, an ensemble of agnostically constructed EoS was studied for the mass and radius measurement. The range of radius of neutron stars obtained from the ensemble was confined within a radius bound from 10.5 - 14.5 km. It is seen that higher masses prefer stiffer EoS. However, the slope of the speed of sound (the stiffness of the EoS) is very sensitive to the radius measurement. Assuming the radius measurement to be precise up to 2 km, then a higher radius indicates sharp stiffening of the equation of state at low density; however, it also indicates a sharp fall after the peak, indicating a relatively softer core for massive neutron stars. On the other hand, for the same precision, a lower radius measurement indicates a relatively softer equation of state.
#### SN 2021wvw: A core-collapse supernova at the sub-luminous, slower, and shorter end of Type IIPs

 - **Abstract**
 We present detailed multi-band photometric and spectroscopic observations and analysis of a rare core-collapse supernova SN 2021wvw, that includes photometric evolution up to 250 d and spectroscopic coverage up to 100 d post-explosion. A unique event that does not fit well within the general trends observed for Type II-P supernovae, SN 2021wvw shows an intermediate luminosity with a short plateau phase of just about 75 d, followed by a very sharp (~10 d) transition to the tail phase. Even in the velocity space, it lies at a lower velocity compared to a larger Type II sample. The observed peak absolute magnitude is -16.1 mag in r-band, and the nickel mass is well constrained to 0.020(6) Msol. Detailed hydrodynamical modeling using MESA+STELLA suggests a radially compact, low-metallicity, high-mass Red Supergiant progenitor (ZAMS mass=18 Msol), which exploded with ~0.2e51 erg/s leaving an ejecta mass of Mej~5 Msol. Significant late-time fallback during the shock propagation phase is also seen in progenitor+explosion models consistent with the light curve properties. As the faintest short-plateau supernova characterized to date, this event adds to the growing diversity of transitional events between the canonical ~100 d plateau Type IIP and stripped-envelope events.
#### Towards a complete picture of the Sco-Cen outflow

 - **Abstract**
 Previous studies have shown strong evidence that the Sun is crossing an outflow originating from the Sco-Cen OB association. Understanding this outflow's origin and structure illuminates how massive star formation shapes the interstellar medium (ISM) and helps predict future Galactic conditions affecting our Solar System. We analysed H I emission and optical ISM absorption lines towards 47 early-type stars around the Upper Sco region to refine the map of the Sco-Cen outflow. Combined with data for nearby stars, we find that the outflow has at least two components: a faster, low-density component traced by Ca II, and a slower, possibly lower-density component traced by Mg II and Fe II in the UV that is passing through the Earth. A constant flow model successfully describes both components with $(l,b,|\vec{v}|) = (335.4^{\circ}, -6.8^{\circ}, 14.0 \,\,\textrm{km}\,\textrm{s}^{-1})$ and $(305.5^{\circ}, +17.6^{\circ}, 21.2\,\,\textrm{km}\,\textrm{s}^{-1})$, respectively. The origin of the faster component points towards the Sco-Cen 15 Myr population, which is consistent with the origin of the slower component within 2 $\sigma$. A simple model comparison indicates that a constant flow is favoured over a spherical flow geometry, implying an extended distribution of feedback sources within Sco-Cen. We also found that a poorly studied 25 pc long H I cloud at a distance of 107 pc belongs to the established Sco-Cen flow.
#### Into the depths: Unveiling ELAIS-N1 with LOFAR's deepest sub-arcsecond wide-field images

 - **Abstract**
 We present the deepest wide-field 115-166 MHz image at sub-arcsecond resolution spanning an area of 2.5 by 2.5 degrees centred at the ELAIS-N1 deep field. To achieve this, we improved the calibration for the International LOFAR Telescope. This enhancement enabled us to efficiently process 32 hrs of data from four different 8-hr observations using the high-band antennas (HBAs) of all 52 stations, covering baselines up to approximately 2,000 km across Europe. The DI calibration was improved by using an accurate sky model and refining the series of calibration steps on the in-field calibrator, while the DD calibration was improved by adopting a more automated approach for selecting the DD calibrators and inspecting the self-calibration on these sources. We also added an additional round of self-calibration for the Dutch core and remote stations in order to refine the solutions for shorter baselines. To complement our highest resolution at 0.3", we also made intermediate resolution wide-field images at 0.6" and 1.2". Our resulting wide-field images achieve a central noise level of 14 muJy/beam at 0.3", doubling the depth and uncovering four times more objects than the Lockman Hole deep field image at comparable resolution but with only 8 hrs of data. Compared to LOFAR imaging without the international stations, we note that due to the increased collecting area and the absence of confusion noise, we reached a point-source sensitivity comparable to a 500-hr ELAIS-N1 6" image with 16 times less observing time. Importantly, we have found that the computing costs for the same amount of data are almost halved (to about 139,000 CPU hrs per 8 hrs of data) compared to previous efforts, though they remain high. Our work underscores the value and feasibility of exploiting all Dutch and international LOFAR stations to make deep wide-field images at sub-arcsecond resolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Traditional pulsar surveys have primarily employed time-domain periodicity searches. However, these methods are susceptible to effects like scattering, eclipses and orbital motion. At lower radio frequencies (<= 300 MHz), factors such as dispersion measure and pulse broadening become more prominent, reducing the detection sensitivity. On the other hand, image domain searches for pulsars are not limited by these effects and can extend the parameter space to regions inaccessible to traditional search techniques. Therefore, we have developed a pipeline to form 1-second full Stokes images from offline correlated high time-resolution data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). This led to the development of image-based methodologies to identify new pulsar candidates. In this paper, we applied these methodologies to perform a low-frequency image-based pulsar census of the Galactic Plane ( 12 MWA observations, covering ~6000 deg^2 sky ). This work focuses on the detection of the known pulsar population which were present in the observed region of the sky using both image-based and beamformed methods. This resulted in the detection of 83 known pulsars, with 16 pulsars found only in Stokes I images but not in periodicity searches applied in beamformed data. Notably, for 14 pulsars these are the first reported low-frequency detections. This underscores the importance of image-based searches for pulsars that may be undetectable in time-series data, due to scattering and/or dispersive smearing at low frequencies. This highlights the importance of low-frequency flux density measurements in refining pulsar spectral models and investigating the spectral turnover of pulsars at low frequencies.

 - **Abstract**
 Precise millisecond pulsar (MSP) positions determined with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) hold the key to building the connection between the kinematic and dynamic reference frames respectively used by VLBI and pulsar timing. The frame connection would provide an important pathway to examining the planetary ephemerides used in pulsar timing, and potentially enhancing the sensitivities of pulsar timing arrays used to detect stochastic gravitational-wave background at nano-Hz regime. We aim at significantly improving the VLBI-based MSP position from its current $\gtrsim1\,$mas precision level by reducing the two dominant components in the positional uncertainty -- the propagation-related uncertainty and the uncertainty resulting from the frequency-dependent core shifts of the reference sources. We introduce a new differential astrometry strategy of using multiple calibrators observed at several widely separated frequencies, which we call PINPT (Phase-screen Interpolation plus frequeNcy-dePendent core shifT correction; read as "pinpoint") for brevity. The strategy allows determination of the core-shift and mitigates the impact of residual delay in the atmosphere. We implemented the strategy on PSR J2222-0137, an MSP well constrained astrometrically with VLBI and pulsar timing. Using the PINPT strategy, we determined core shifts for 4 AGNs around PSR J2222-0137, and derived a VLBI-based pulsar position with uncertainty of 0.17 mas and 0.32 mas in right ascension and declination, respectively, approaching the uncertainty level of the best-determined timing-based MSP positions. The realization of the PINPT strategy promises a factor-of-5 positional precision enhancement (over conventional VLBI astrometry) for all kinds of compact radio sources observed at $\lesssim2$ GHz, including most fast radio bursts.

 - **Abstract**
 The Single Aperture Large Telescope for Universe Studies (SALTUS) is a far-infrared space mission concept with unprecedented spatial and spectral resolution. Saltus consists of a 14-m inflatable primary, providing 16 times the sensitivity and 4 times the angular resolution of Herschel, and two cryogenic detectors spanning a wavelength range of 34-660 microns and spectral resolving power of 300 - 1e7. Spectroscopic observations in the far-infrared offer many unique windows into the processes of star and planet formation. These include observations of low energy water transitions, the H2 mass tracer HD, many CHONS constraining molecules such as NH3 and H2S, and emission lines from the phonon modes of molecular ices. Observing these species will allow us to build a statistical sample of protoplanetary disk masses, characterize the water snowline, identify Kuiper Belt like debris rings around other stars, and trace the evolution CHONS from prestellar cores, through to protoplanetary disks and debris disks. This paper details details several key star and planet formation science goals achievable with SALTUS.
