#### The Global Structure of Molecular Clouds: I. Trends with Mass and Star  Formation Rate
 - **Authors:** Nia Imara, John C. Forbes

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a model for the large-scale, global 3D structure of molecular clouds. Motivated by the morphological appearance of clouds in surface density maps, we model clouds as cylinders, with the aim of backing out information about the volume density distribution of gas and its relationship to star formation. We test our model by applying it to surface density maps for a sample of nearby clouds and find solutions that fit each of the observed radial surface density profiles remarkably well. Our most salient findings are that clouds with higher central volume densities are more compact and also have lower total mass. These same lower-mass clouds tend to have shorter gas depletion times, regardless of whether we consider their total mass or dense mass. Our analyses lead us to conclude that cylindrical clouds can be characterized by a universal structure that sets the timescale on which they form stars.
#### Dissecting the emission from LHAASO J0341+5258: implications for future  multi-wavelength observations

 - **Abstract**
 The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) has detected multiple ultra-high energy (UHE; E$_\gamma \ge$ 100 TeV) gamma-ray sources in the Milky Way Galaxy, which are associated with Galactic ``PeVatrons'' that accelerate particles up to PeV (= 10$^{15}$ eV) energies. Although supernova remnants (SNRs) and pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), as source classes, are considered the leading candidates, further theoretical and observational efforts are needed to find conclusive proof to confirm the nature of these PeVatrons. This work aims to provide a phenomenological model to account for the emission observed from the direction of LHAASO J0341+5258, an unidentified UHE gamma-ray source observed by LHAASO. 15 years of Fermi-LAT data was analyzed to find the high energy (HE; 100 MeV $\le$ E$_\gamma$ $\le$ 100 GeV) GeV gamma-ray counterpart of LHAASO J0341+5258, in the 4FGL-DR3 catalog. We have explained the spectrum of the closest 4FGL source, 4FGL J0340.4+5302, by a synchro-curvature emission formalism typically used in the case of GeV pulsars. Escape-limited hadronic interaction between protons accelerated in an old, now invisible SNR and cold protons inside associated molecular clouds (MCs) and leptonic emission from a putative TeV halo was explored to explain the multi-wavelength (MWL) spectral energy distribution (SED) observed from the LHAASO source region. We have further discussed possible observational avenues that can be explored in the near future and predicted the outcome of those observational efforts from the model explored in this paper.
#### Anisotropic neutron star crust, solar system mountains, and  gravitational waves

 - **Abstract**
 Mountains or non-axisymmetric deformations of rotating neutron stars (NS) efficiently radiate gravitational waves (GW). We consider analogies between NS mountains and surface features of solar system bodies. Both NS and moons such as Europa or Enceladus have thin crusts over deep oceans while Mercury has a thin crust over a large metallic core. Thin sheets may wrinkle in universal ways. Europa has linear features, Enceladus has ``Tiger" stripes, and Mercury has lobate scarps. NS may have analogous features. The innermost inner core of the Earth is anisotropic with a shear modulus that depends on direction. If NS crust material is also anisotropic this will produce an ellipticity, when the crust is stressed, that grows with spin frequency. This yields a breaking index (log derivative of spin down rate) very different from $n=5$ and could explain the maximum spin observed for neutron stars and a possible minimum ellipticity of millisecond pulsars.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. We study the relation between the known binary fraction and spectral absorption feature index to judge whether (and potentially which) spectral absorption feature indices are suitable for determining the binary fraction. Aims. The determination of the binary fraction is important in studies of binary star formation, evolutionary population synthesis models, and other works. The number of binary stars is difficult to determine for nearly all stellar systems because the individual stars are need to be resolved photometrically or spectroscopically. By comparison, their integrated spectra or spectral absorption feature indices are relatively easy to obtain. Results. We find that the low-resolution (15\,\AA) spectrum is not suitable for this study and the binary fraction type would affect the results: $f$($q$>0.5) and $f$(tot)$^{\rm mc}$ exhibit better correlations with the spectral absorption feature index than $f$(tot)$^{\rm mf}$ and the difference in metallicity would significantly affect the above relationship. % Finally, to eliminate the effects of metallicity, age, and dynamical evolution, we only used those GCs with multiple spectra observed among different regions. % We find that OIII-1, OIII-2, H$_{\rm \gamma F}$, H$_{\rm \delta F}$, H$_{\rm \gamma A}$, H$_{\rm \delta A}$, H$_{\rm \beta}$, Ca4455, C$_2$4668, and TiO$_1$ indices have strong correlations with binary fraction. % The two OIII indices are the most sensitive to the binary fraction, followed by four Balmer indices -- the two narrower central bandpass Balmer indices ($\sim$20\AA, F-definition) are more sensitive than the wider two ($\sim$40\AA, A-definition) and, lastly, the Ca4455, C$_2$4668, and TiO$_1$ indices.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Several bright emission line regions have been observed in the central 100 parsecs of the active galaxy NGC 1068. Aims. We aim to determine the properties and ionization mechanism of three regions of NGC 1068: the nucleus (B) and two clouds located at 0.3" and 0.7" north of it (C and D). Methods. We combined SPHERE (0.95 - 1.65 um) and SINFONI (1.5 - 2.45 um) spectra for the three regions B, C, and D. We compared these spectra to several CLOUDY photoionization models and to the MAPPINGS III Library of Fast Radiative Shock Models. Results. The emission line spectra of the three regions are almost identical to each other and contribute to most of the emission line flux in the nuclear region. The emitting media contain multiple phases, the most luminous of which have temperatures ranging from 104.8 K to 106 K. Central photoionization models can reproduce some features of the spectra, but the fast radiative shock model provides the best fit to the data. Conclusions. The similarity between the three regions indicates that they belong to the same class of objects. Based on our comparisons, we conclude that they are shock regions located where the jet of the active galactic nucleus impacts massive molecular clouds.
#### An in-depth view of the metallicity distribution of the Small Magellanic  Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 The spatial metallicity distribution of star clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) has recently been found to correlate as a V-shaped function with the semi-major axis of an elliptical framework proposed to assume a projected galaxy flattening. We report results on the impact that the use of such a framework can produce on our understanding of the SMC formation and its chemical enrichment. We show that clusters with similar semi-major axes are placed at a very different distances from the SMC centre. The recently claimed bimodal metallicity distribution of clusters projected on the innermost SMC regions and the V-shaped metallicity gradient fade away when actual distances are used. Although a large dispersion prevails, clusters older than $\sim$ 1 Gyr exhibit a shallow metallicity gradient, caused by slightly different spatial distributions of clusters younger and older than $\sim$ 4 Gyr; the former being more centrally concentrated and having a mean metallicity ([Fe/H]) $\sim$ 0.15 dex more metal-rich than that of older clusters. This metallicity gradient does not show any dependence with the position angle, except for clusters placed beyond 11 kpc, which are located in the eastern side of the galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Even if their detection is for now challenging, observation of small terrestrial planets will be easier in a near future thanks to continuous improvements of detection and characterisation instruments. In this quest, climate modeling is a key step to understand their characteristics, atmospheric composition and possible history. If a surface water reservoir is present on such a terrestrial planet, an increase in insolation may lead to a dramatic positive feedback induced by water evaporation: the runaway greenhouse. The resulting rise of global surface temperature leads to the evaporation of the entire water reservoir, separating two very different population of planets: 1) temperate planets with a surface water ocean and 2) hot planets with a puffed atmosphere dominated by water vapor. In this work we use a 3D General Circulation Model (GCM), the Generic-PCM, to study the runaway greenhouse transition, linking temperate and post-runaway states. Our simulations are made of two steps. First, assuming initially a liquid surface ocean, an evaporation phase which enriches the atmosphere in water vapor. Second, when the ocean is considered entirely evaporated, a dry transition phase for which the surface temperature increases dramatically. Finally, it converges on a hot and stable post-runaway state. By describing in detail the evolution of the climate during these two steps, we show a rapid transition of the cloud coverage and of the wind circulation from the troposphere to the stratosphere. By comparing our result to previous studies using 1D models, we discuss the effect of intrinsically 3D processes such as the global dynamics and the clouds, keys to understand the runaway greenhouse. We also explore the potential reversibility of the runaway greenhouse, limited by its radiative unbalance.

 - **Abstract**
 Near-infrared bandpasses on spaceborne observatories diverge from their ground-based counterparts as they are free of atmospheric telluric absorption. Available transformations between respective filter systems in the literature rely on theoretical stellar atmospheres, which are known to have difficulties reproducing observed spectral energy distributions of cool giants. We present new transformations between the 2MASS $JHK_S$ and HST WFC3/IR F110W, F125W, & F160W photometric systems based on synthetic photometry of empirical stellar spectra from four spectral libraries. This sample comprises over 1000 individual stars, which together span nearly the full HR diagram and sample stellar populations from the solar neighborhood out to the Magellanic Clouds, covering a broad range of ages, metallicities, and other relevant stellar properties. In addition to global color-dependent transformations, we examine band-to-band differences for cool, luminous giant stars in particular, including multiple types of primary distance indicators.
#### The Eclipse Mapping Null Space: Comparing Theoretical Predictions with  Observed Maps

 - **Abstract**
 High-precision exoplanet eclipse light curves, like those possible with JWST, enable flux and temperature mapping of exoplanet atmospheres. These eclipse maps will have unprecedented precision, providing an opportunity to constrain current theoretical predictions of exoplanet atmospheres. However, eclipse mapping has unavoidable mathematical limitations because many map patterns are unobservable. This ``null space'' has implications for making comparisons between predictions from general circulation models (GCMs) and the observed planet maps, and, thus, affects our understanding of the physical processes driving the observed maps. We describe the eclipse-mapping null space and show how GCM forward models can be transformed to their observable modes for more appropriate comparison with retrieved eclipse maps, demonstrated with applications to synthetic data of an ultra-hot Jupiter and a cloudy warm Jupiter under JWST-best-case- and extreme-precision observing scenarios. We show that the effects of the null space can be mitigated and manipulated through observational design, and JWST exposure times are short enough to not increase the size of the null space. Furthermore, we show the mathematical connection between the null space and the ``eigenmapping'' method, demonstrating how eigenmaps can be used to understand the null space in a model-independent way. We leverage this connection to incorporate null-space uncertainties in retrieved maps, which increases the uncertainties to now encompass the ground truth for synthetic data. The comparisons between observed maps and forward models that are enabled by this work, and the improved eclipse-mapping uncertainties, will be critical to our interpretation of multidimensional aspects of exoplanets in the JWST era.
#### Moderate D/H Ratios in Methane Ice on Eris and Makemake as Evidence of  Hydrothermal or Metamorphic Processes in Their Interiors: Geochemical  Analysis

 - **Abstract**
 Dwarf planets Eris and Makemake have surfaces bearing methane ice of unknown origin. D/H ratios were recently determined from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of Eris and Makemake (Grundy et al., submitted), giving us new clues to decipher the origin of methane. Here, we develop geochemical models to test if the origin of methane could be primordial, derived from CO$_2$ or CO ("abiotic"), or sourced by organics ("thermogenic"). We find that primordial methane is inconsistent with the observational data, whereas both abiotic and thermogenic methane can have D/H ratios that overlap the observed ranges. This suggests that Eris and Makemake either never acquired a significant amount of methane during their formation, or their original inventories were removed and then replaced by a source of internally produced methane. Because producing abiotic or thermogenic methane likely requires temperatures in excess of ~150{\deg}C, we infer that Eris and Makemake have rocky cores that underwent substantial radiogenic heating. Their cores may still be warm/hot enough to produce methane. This heating could have driven hydrothermal circulation at the bottom of an ice-covered ocean to generate abiotic methane, and/or metamorphic reactions involving accreted organic matter could have occurred in response to heating in the deeper interior, generating thermogenic methane. Additional analyses of thermal evolution model results and predictions from modeling of D-H exchange in the solar nebula support our findings of elevated subsurface temperatures and a lack of primordial methane on Eris and Makemake. It remains an open question whether their D/H ratios may have evolved subsequent to methane outgassing. Recommendations are given for future activities to further test proposed scenarios of abiotic and thermogenic methane production on Eris and Makemake, and to explore these worlds up close.
#### Can massive stars form in low mass clouds?

 - **Abstract**
 The conditions required for massive star formation are debated, particularly whether massive stars must form in conjunction with massive clusters. Some authors have advanced the view that stars of any mass (below the total cluster mass) can form in clusters of any mass with some probability (random sampling). Others pointed out that the scatter in the determinations of the most massive star mass for a given cluster mass was consistent with the measurement error, such that the mass of the most massive star was determined by the total cluster mass (optimal sampling). Here we investigate the relation between cluster mass (M\textsubscript{ecl}) and the maximum stellar mass (M\textsubscript{max}) using a suite of SPH simulations. Varying cloud mass and turbulence random seed results in a range of cluster masses which we compare with their respective maximum star masses. We find that more massive clusters will have, on average, higher mass stars with this trend being steeper at lower cluster masses ($M\textsubscript{max} \propto M\textsubscript{ecl}^{0.31}$ for $M\textsubscript{ecl}<500M\,_{\odot}$) and flattening at higher cluster masses ($M\textsubscript{max} \propto M\textsubscript{ecl}^{0.11}$ for $M\textsubscript{ecl}>500M\,_{\odot}$). This rules out purely stochastic star formation in our simulations. Significant scatter in the maximum masses with identical initial conditions also rules out the possibility that the relation is purely deterministic (that is that a given cluster mass will result in a specific maximum stellar mass). In conclusion our simulations disagree with both random and optimal sampling of the initial mass function.
