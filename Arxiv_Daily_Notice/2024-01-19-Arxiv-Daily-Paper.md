#### A Volume-Limited Sample of Ultracool Dwarfs. II. The Substellar Age and  Mass Functions in the Solar Neighborhood
 - **Authors:** William M. J. Best, Aniket Sanghi, Michael C. Liu, Eugene A. Magnier, Trent J. Dupuy

 - **Abstract**
 We present the most precise constraints to date for the mass and age distributions of single ultracool dwarfs in the solar neighborhood, based on an updated volume-limited sample of 504 L, T, and Y dwarfs within 25 pc. We develop a Monte Carlo approach using the $\langle V/V_{\rm max}\rangle$ statistic to correct for incompleteness and obtain a space density of $(1.83_{-0.15}^{+0.16})\times10^{-2}$ pc$^{-3}$ for spectral types L0-Y2. We calculate bolometric luminosities for our sample, using an updated "super-magnitude" method for the faintest objects. We use our resulting luminosity function and a likelihood-based population synthesis approach to simultaneously constrain the mass and age distributions. We employ the fraction of young L0-L7 dwarfs as a novel input for this analysis that is crucial for constraining the age distribution. For a power-law mass function $\frac{dN}{dM} \propto M^{-\alpha}$ we find $\alpha=0.58_{-0.20}^{+0.16}$, indicating an increase in numbers toward lower masses, consistent with measurements in nearby star-forming regions. For an exponential age distribution $b(t) \propto e^{-\beta t}$ we find $\beta=-0.44\pm0.14$, i.e., a population with fewer old objects than often assumed, which may reflect dynamical heating of the Galactic plane as much as the historical brown dwarf birthrate. We compare our analysis to Kirkpatrick et al. (2021), who used a similar volume-limited sample. Although our mass function measurements are numerically consistent, their assumption of a flat age distribution is disfavored by our analysis, and we identify several important methodological differences between our two studies. Our calculation of the age distribution of solar neighborhood brown dwarfs is the first based on a volume-limited sample.
#### How Small-scale Jet-like Solar Events from Miniature Flux Rope Eruptions  Might Produce the Solar Wind

 - **Abstract**
 We consider small-scale jet-like events that might make the solar wind, as has been suggested in recent studies. We show that the events referred to as "coronal jets" and as "jetlets" both fall on a power-law distribution that also includes large-scale eruptions and spicule-sized features; all of the jet-like events could contribute to the solar wind. Based on imaging and magnetic field data, it is plausible that many or most of these events might form by the same mechanism: Magnetic flux cancelation produces small-scale flux ropes, often containing a cool-material minifilament. This minifilament/flux rope erupts and reconnects with adjacent open coronal field, along which "plasma jets" flow and contribute to the solar wind. The erupting flux ropes can contain twist that is transferred to the open field, and these become Alfv\'enic pulses that form magnetic switchbacks, providing an intrinsic connection between switchbacks and the production of the solar wind.
#### Stellar population astrophysics (SPA) with the TNG. Abundance analysis  of nearby red giants and red clump stars: combining high resolution  spectroscopy and asteroseismology

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Asteroseismology, a powerful approach for obtaining internal structure and stellar properties, requires surface temperature and chemical composition information to determine mass and age. High-resolution spectroscopy is a valuable technique for precise stellar parameters (including surface temperature) and chemical composition analysis. Aim: We aim to combine spectroscopic parameters with asteroseismology to test stellar models. Method: Using high-resolution optical and near-IR spectra from GIARPS at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, we conducted a detailed spectroscopic analysis of 16 stars photometrically selected to be on the red giant and red clump. Stellar parameters and chemical abundances for light elements (Li, C, N, F), Fe peak, $\alpha$ and n-capture elements were derived using a combination of equivalent widths and spectral synthesis techniques, based on atomic and molecular features. Ages were determined through asteroseismic scaling relations and compared with ages based on chemical clocks, [Y/Mg] and [C/N]. Results: Spectroscopic parameters confirmed the stars as part of the red giant branch and red clump. Two objects, HD 22045 and HD 24680 exhibited relatively high Li abundances, with HD 24680 potentially being a Li-rich giant resulting from mass transfer with an intermediate-mass companion, which already underwent its AGB phase. Stellar parameters derived from scaling different sets of relations were consistent with each other. For what concerns ages, the values based on asteroseismology were in excellent agreement with those derived from theoretical evolutionary tracks, but did not align with ages derived from the chemical clocks [Y/Mg] and [C/N].

 - **Abstract**
 The NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) is the primary Digital Library portal for researchers in astronomy and astrophysics. Over the past 30 years, the ADS has gone from being an astronomy-focused bibliographic database to an open digital library system supporting research in space and (soon) earth sciences. This paper describes the evolution of the ADS system, its capabilities, and the technological infrastructure underpinning it. We give an overview of the ADS's original architecture, constructed primarily around simple database models. This bespoke system allowed for the efficient indexing of metadata and citations, the digitization and archival of full-text articles, and the rapid development of discipline-specific capabilities running on commodity hardware. The move towards a cloud-based microservices architecture and an open-source search engine in the late 2010s marked a significant shift, bringing full-text search capabilities, a modern API, higher uptime, more reliable data retrieval, and integration of advanced visualizations and analytics. Another crucial evolution came with the gradual and ongoing incorporation of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing algorithms in our data pipelines. Originally used for information extraction and classification tasks, NLP and ML techniques are now being developed to improve metadata enrichment, search, notifications, and recommendations. we describe how these computational techniques are being embedded into our software infrastructure, the challenges faced, and the benefits reaped. Finally, we conclude by describing the future prospects of ADS and its ongoing expansion, discussing the challenges of managing an interdisciplinary information system in the era of AI and Open Science, where information is abundant, technology is transformative, but their trustworthiness can be elusive.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate an SNR W28 with the Suzaku archive data and report the results of spatial resolved analyses. We carry out spectral analysis using a recombining plasma (RP) model with an element-dependent initial ionization temperature, and obtain the ionization temperatures to be $\sim0.5$~keV for Ne, $\sim0.7$~keV for Mg, $\sim1.0$~keV for Si, $\sim1.2$~keV for S, $\sim1.4$~keV for Ar, $\sim1.7$~keV for Ca, and $\sim0.7$~keV for Fe in the RP-initial phase. In addition to northeast regions where RP have been reported, we find that the ionization temperature in the southeast and southwest regions show a similar trend to the central region, in the RP-initial phase. Furthermore, the elapsed time from the RP-initial phase to present is shorter, $\sim300$~yr in the central region and longer, $\sim10^3$-$10^4$~yr in the outside regions. Our results cannot be explained by simple scenarios of thermal conduction due to molecular clouds or adiabatic cooling (rarefaction), and indicate that more complex mechanism or other scenarios are required. Also, we estimate the ejecta mass $\gtrsim14M_{\odot}$, which indicates a SNR derived a massive star.
#### Amplification and saturation of turbulent magnetic field in collapsing  primordial gas clouds

 - **Abstract**
 Recent numerical studies suggest that magnetic fields play an important role in primordial star formation in the early universe. However, the detailed evolution of the magnetic field in the collapse phase still has uncertainties because of the complicated physics associated with turbulence in a collapsing magnetized system. Here, we perform a suite of numerical MHD simulations that follow the collapse of magnetized, turbulent primordial gas clouds to investigate the evolution of the magnetic field associated with the turbulence, assuming a polytropic equation of state with exponent $\gamma_{\rm eff}$ and with various numerical resolutions. In addition, we generalize the analytic theory of magnetic field growth/saturation so that it can deal with various exponents $\gamma_{\rm eff}$ and turbulence energy spectra. We find that the numerical results are well reproduced by the theory for various $\gamma_{\rm eff}$ through the collapse phase during the formation of the first stars. The magnetic field is eventually amplified by a factor of $10^{12}$ -- $10^{15}$ due to kinematic and non-linear turbulent dynamo effects and reaches 3% -- 100% of the equipartition level, depending on $\gamma_{\rm eff}$. We also find that the transition between the kinematic and non-linear stages can be analytically estimated. These results indicate that the strong magnetic field accompanied by supersonic turbulence is a general property and suggest that it can play a crucial role in the formation of the first stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of 9 new hot molecular cores in the Deep South (DS) region of Sagittarius B2 using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 6 observations. We measure the rotational temperature of CH$_3$OH and derive the physical conditions present within these cores and the hot core Sgr B2(S). The cores show heterogeneous temperature structure, with peak temperatures between 252 and 662 K. We find that the cores span a range of masses (203-4842 M$_\odot$) and radii (3587-9436 AU). CH$_3$OH abundances consistently increase with temperature across the sample. Our measurements show the DS hot cores are structurally similar to Galactic Disk hot cores, with radii and temperature gradients that are comparable to sources in the Disk. They also show shallower density gradients than Disk hot cores, which may arise from the Central Molecular Zone's higher density threshold for star formation. The hot cores have properties which are consistent with those of Sgr B2(N), with 3 associated with Class II CH$_3$OH masers and one associated with an UCHII region. Our sample nearly doubles the high-mass star forming gas mass near Sgr B2(S) and suggest the region may be a younger, comparably massive counterpart to Sgr B2(N) and (M). The relationship between peak CH$_3$OH abundance and rotational temperature traced by our sample and a selection of comparable hot cores is qualitatively consistent with predictions from chemical modeling. However, we observe constant peak abundances at higher temperatures ($T \gtrsim 250$ K), which may indicate mechanisms for methanol survival that are not yet accounted for in models.

 - **Abstract**
 The initial-final mass relation (IFMR) plays a crucial role in understanding stellar structure and evolution by linking a star's initial mass to the mass of the resulting white dwarf. This study explores the IFMR in the initial mass range $0.8 \leq M_\mathrm{ini} / M_\odot \leq 4$ using full PARSEC evolutionary calculations supplemented with COLIBRI computations to complete the ejection of the envelope and obtain the final core mass. Recent works have shown that the supposed monotonicity of the IFMR is interrupted by a kink in the initial mass range $M_\mathrm{ini} \approx 1.65-2.10 M_\odot$, due to the interaction between recurrent dredge-up episodes and stellar winds in carbon stars evolving on the thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase. To reproduce the IFMR non-monotonic behavior we investigate the role of convective overshooting efficiency applied to the base of the convective envelope ($f_\mathrm{env}$) and to the borders of the pulse-driven convective zone ($f_\mathrm{pdcz}$), as well as its interplay with mass loss. We compare our models to observational data and find that $f_\mathrm{env}$ must vary with initial mass in order to accurately reproduce the IFMR's observed kink and slopes. We find some degeneracy between the overshooting parameters when only the IFMR information is used. Nonetheless, this analysis provides valuable insights into the internal mixing processes during the TP-AGB phase.
#### Effective equation of state of a radiatively cooling gas: Self-similar  solution of spherical collapse

 - **Abstract**
 The temperature of the interstellar medium (ISM) is governed by several physical process, among which radiative cooling, external UV/cosmic ray heating, and the mechanical work by compression and expansion. In regimes where the dynamical effect is important, the temperature deviates from that derived by simply balancing the heating and cooling functions. This renders the expression of the gas energy evolution with a simple equation of state (EOS) less straightforward. Given a cooling function, the behavior of the gas is subject to the combined effect of dynamical compression and radiative cooling. The goal of the present work is to derive the effective EOS of a collapsing gas within a full fluid solution. We solve the Navier-Stokes equations with a parametric cooling term in spherical coordinate and look for a self-similar collapse solution. We present a solution which describes a cloud that is contracting while losing energy through radiation. This yields an effective EOS that can be generally applied to various ISM context, where the cooling function is available from first principles, and expressed as powerlaw product of the density and temperature. Our findings suggest that a radiatively cooling gas under self-gravitating collapse can easily manifest an effective polytropic EOS, even isothermal in many scenarios. The present model provides theoretical justification for the simplifying isothermal assumptions of simulations at various scales, and can also provide a more realistic thermal recipe without additional computation cost.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar aromatic molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic nitrogen and oxygen bearing molecules are thought to be abundant in the interstellar medium. In this class of molecules, benzonitrile ($c$-C$_6$H$_5$CN) plays an important role as a proxy for benzene. It has been detected through rotational emission in several astrophysical sources and is one of the simplest N-bearing polar aromatic molecules. Even in the cold ISM, the population of the rotational levels of benzonitrile might not be at equilibrium. Consequently, modeling its detected emission lines requires a prior computation of its quenching rate coefficients by the most abundant species in the ISM (He or H$_2$). In this paper, we focus on the excitation of c-C$_6$H$_5$CN by collision with He. We compute the first potential energy surface (PES) using the explicitly correlated coupled cluster method in conjunction with large basis sets. The PES obtained is characterized by a potential well depth of -97.2 cm$^{-1}$ and an important anisotropy. Scattering computations of the rotational (de-)excitation of c-C$_6$H$_5$CN by He atoms are performed by means of the coupled states approximation that allow to obtain collisional rates for rotational states up to $j$ = 9 and temperatures up to 40 K. These rate coefficients are then used to examine the effect of C$_6$H$_5$CN excitation induced by collisions with para-H$_2$ in molecular clouds by carrying out simple radiative transfer calculations of the excitation temperatures and show that non-equilibrium effects can be expected for H$_2$ densities up to 10$^5$-10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Short Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are often associated with NSNS or BHNS mergers. The discovery of GW/GRB 170817A has enhanced our understanding, revealing that the interaction between relativistic jets and post-merger outflows influences the observed radiation. However, the nature of compact binary merger event suggests that the system can be more complex than the uniform jet interacting with a homologously expanding wind. We consider here an improved scenario by performing a set of two-dimensional, large scale numerical simulations, and we investigate the interaction between short GRB jets and post-merger disk wind outflows. We focus on two types of configurations, arising from NSNS and BHNS mergers. The simulations consider the effects of the r-process nucleosynthesis in the accretion disk wind on its pressure profile. The main properties of the jet, such as its energy distribution and collimation degree, are estimated from our simulations. We found that a) the impact of the r-process on initial wind pressure leads to significant changes in the jet collimation and cocoon expansion; b) the angular structure of thermal and kinetic energy components in the jets, cocoons, and winds differ with respect to simple homologous models, hence it would affect the predictions of GRB afterglow emission; c) the temporal evolution of the structure reveals conversion of thermal to kinetic energy being different for each component in the system (jet, cocoon, and wind); d) post-merger environments influence energy structure and material dispersion, altering the interaction between jets and disk winds. %Our study underscores the importance of post-merger disk wind in the jet propagation, emphasizing the need for careful parameter selection to avoid interpretation degeneracy in the electromagnetic counterparts.
#### COOL-LAMPS VI: Lens model and New Constraints on the Properties of COOL  J1241+2219, a Bright z = 5 Lyman Break Galaxy and its z = 1 Cluster Lens

 - **Abstract**
 We present a strong lensing analysis of COOL J1241+2219, the brightest known gravitationally lensed galaxy at $z \geq 5$, based on new multi-band Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging data. The lensed galaxy has a redshift of z=5.043, placing it shortly after the end of the Epoch of Reionization, and an AB magnitude z_AB=20.47 mag (Khullar et al. 2021). As such, it serves as a touchstone for future research of that epoch. The high spatial resolution of HST reveals internal structure in the giant arc, from which we identify 15 constraints and construct a robust lens model. We use the lens model to extract cluster mass and lensing magnification. We find that the mass enclosed within the Einstein radius of the z=1.001 cluster lens is M(<5.77'')=$1.079^{+0.023}_{-0.007}$, significantly lower than other known strong lensing clusters at its redshift. The average magnification of the giant arc is $<\mu_{arc}>=76^{+40}_{-20}$, a factor of $2.4^{+1.4}_{-0.7}$ greater than previously estimated from ground-based data; the flux-weighted average magnification is $<\mu_{arc}>=92^{+37}_{-31}$ We update the current measurements of the stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) of the source for the revised magnification, $\log(M_\star/M_{\odot})=9.7\pm0.3$ and ${\rm SFR} = 10.3^{+7.0}_{-4.4}$ $ M_{\odot} $yr$^{-1}$. The powerful lensing magnification acting upon COOL J1241+2219 resolves the source and enables future studies of the properties of its star formation on a clump-by-clump basis. The lensing analysis presented here will support upcoming multiwavelength characterization with HST and JWST data of the stellar mass assembly and physical properties of this high-redshift lensed galaxy.
