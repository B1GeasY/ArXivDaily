 - **Abstract**
 The presence of short-lived radioisotopes (SLRs) 26-Al and 60-Fe in the Solar system places constraints on the initial conditions of our planetary system. Most theories posit that the origin of 26-Al and 60-Fe is in the interiors of massive stars, and they are either delivered directly to the protosolar disc from the winds and supernovae of the massive stars, or indirectly via a sequential star formation event. However, massive stars that produce SLRs also emit photoionising far and extreme ultraviolet radiation, which can destroy the gas component of protoplanetary discs, possibly precluding the formation of gas giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn. Here, we perfom N-body simulations of star-forming regions and determine whether discs that are enriched in SLRs can retain enough gas to form Jovian planets. We find that discs are enriched and survive the photoionising radiation only when the dust radius of the disc is fixed and not allowed to move inwards due to the photoevaporation, or outwards due to viscous spreading. Even in this optimal scenario, not enough discs survive until the supernovae of the massive stars and so have zero or very little enrichment in 60-Fe. We therefore suggest that the delivery of SLRs to the Solar system may not come from the winds and supernovae of massive stars.
#### Oort Cloud Comets Discovered Far from the Sun

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Increasingly, Oort Cloud comets are being discovered at great distances from the Sun and tracked over ever wider ranges of heliocentric distances as observational equipment improves. Aims: To investigate in detail how the original semimajor axis for near-parabolic comets depends on the selected data arc and the assumed form of the non-gravitational (NG) acceleration. Methods: Among currently known Oort Cloud comets with large perihelion distances ($q > 3$ au), we selected 32 objects observed over the widest ranges of heliocentric distances in orbital legs before and after perihelion. For each of them, we determined a series of orbits using at least three basic types of data sets selected from available positional data (pre- and post-perihelion data and the entire data set), and a few forms of NG acceleration representing water ice or CO sublimation. Results: We found that the motion of comets is often measurably affected by NG forces at heliocentric distances beyond 5 au from the Sun. The most spectacular example is C/2010 U3 (Boattini), whose perihelion distance is 8.44 au. NG effects are detectable for 19 of the 32 comets within the positional data. For five comets, we found asymmetric effects of NG forces - in three cases significantly greater before perihelion than afterward (C/2017 M4, C/2000 SV$_{75}$, and C/2015 O1), and in two others the opposite (C/1997 BA$_6$ and C/2006 S3). We also find that the well-known systematic effect of finding more tightly bound original orbits when including the NG acceleration than in purely gravitational solutions may be related to the specific form of the standard $g(r)$ function describing the sublimation of ices.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos are known to play important roles in many astrophysical scenarios from the early period of the big bang to current stellar evolution being a unique messenger of the fusion reactions occurring in the center of our sun. In particular, neutrinos are crucial in determining the dynamics and the composition evolution in explosive events such as core-collapse supernovae and the merger of two neutron stars. In this paper, we review the current understanding of supernovae and binary neutron star mergers by focusing on the role of neutrinos therein. Several recent improvements on the theoretical modeling of neutrino interaction rates in nuclear matter as well as their impact on the heavy element nucleosynthesis in the supernova neutrino-driven wind are discussed, including the neutrino-nucleon opacity at the mean field level taking into account the relativistic kinematics of nucleons, the effect due to the nucleon-nucleon correlation, and the nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung. We also review the framework used to compute the neutrino-nucleus interactions and the up-to-date yield prediction for isotopes from neutrino nucleosynthesis occurring in the outer envelope of the supernova progenitor star during the explosion. Here improved predictions of energy spectra of supernova neutrinos of all flavors have had significant impact on the nucleosynthesis yields. Rapid progresses in modeling the flavor oscillations of neutrinos in these environments, including several novel mechanisms for collective neutrino oscillations and their potential impacts on various nucleosynthesis processes are summarized.
#### Deuterated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in the Interstellar Medium:  The Aliphatic C--D Band Strengths

 - **Abstract**
 Deuterium (D) was exclusively generated in the Big Bang and the standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) model predicts a primordial abundance of D/H~26ppm. As the Galaxy evolves, D/H gradually decreases because of astration. The Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) model predicts a present-day abundance of D/H~20ppm. However, observations of the local interstellar medium (ISM) have revealed that the gas-phase interstellar D/H varies considerably from one region to another and has a median abundance of D/H~13ppm, substantially lower than predicted from the BBN and GCE models. It has been suggested that the missing D atoms of D/H~7ppm could have been locked up in deuterated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. However, we have previously demonstrated that PAHs with aromatic C--D units are insufficient to account for the missing D. Here we explore if PAHs with aliphatic C--D units could be a reservoir of D. We perform quantum chemical computations of the vibrational spectra of "superdeuterated" PAHs (in which one D and one H share an C atom) and PAHs attached with D-substituted methyl group, and derive the band strengths of the aliphatic C--D stretch (A_4.65). By applying the computationally derived A_4.65 to the observed aliphatic C--D emission at ~4.6--4.8 micron, we find that PAHs with aliphatic C--D units could have tied up a substantial amount of D/H and marginally account for the missing D. The possible routes to generate PAHs with aliphatic C--D units are also discussed.
#### Predicting gravitational waves from jittering-jets-driven core collapse  supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 I estimate the frequencies of gravitational waves from jittering jets that explode core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) to crudely be 5-30 Hz, and with strains that might allow detection of Galactic CCSNe. The jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) asserts that most CCSNe are exploded by jittering jets that the newly born neutron star (NS) launches within few seconds. According to the JJEM, instabilities in the accreted gas lead to the formation of intermittent accretion disks that launch the jittering jets. Earlier studies that did not include jets calculated the gravitational frequencies that instabilities around the NS emit to have a peak in the crude frequency range of 100-2000 Hz. Based on a recent study, I take the source of the gravitational waves of jittering jets to be the turbulent bubbles (cocoons) that the jets inflate as they interact with the outer layers of the core of the star at thousands of kilometres from the NS. The lower frequencies and larger strain than those of gravitational waves from instabilities in CCSNe allow future, and maybe present, detectors to identify the gravitational wave signals of jittering jets. Detection of gravitational waves from local CCSNe might distinguish between the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism and the JJEM.
