#### Machine Learning-Based Detection of Non-Axisymmetric Fast Neutrino  Flavor Instabilities in Core-Collapse Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 In dense neutrino environments like core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and neutron star mergers (NSMs), neutrinos can undergo fast flavor conversions (FFC) when their angular distribution of neutrino electron lepton number ($\nu$ELN) crosses zero along some directions. While previous studies have demonstrated the detection of axisymmetric $\nu$ELN crossings in these extreme environments, non-axisymmetric crossings have remained elusive, mostly due to the absence of models for their angular distributions. In this study, we present a pioneering analysis of the detection of non-axisymmetric $\nu$ELN crossings using machine learning (ML) techniques. Our ML models are trained on data from two CCSN simulations, one with rotation and one without, where non-axisymmetric features in neutrino angular distributions play a crucial role. We demonstrate that our ML models achieve detection accuracies exceeding 90\%. This is an important improvement, especially considering that a significant portion of $\nu$ELN crossings in these models eluded detection by earlier methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Resolving the environments of massive stars is crucial for understanding their formation mechanisms and their impact on galaxy evolution. An important open question is whether massive stars found in diffuse regions outside spiral arms formed in-situ or migrated there after forming in denser environments. To address this question, we use multi-resolution measurements of extinction in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) to probe the ISM surrounding massive stars across galactic environments. We construct a catalog of 42,107 main-sequence massive star candidates ($M \geq 8 M_{\odot}$) using resolved stellar photometry from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) program, plus stellar and dust model fits from the Bayesian Extinction and Stellar Tool (BEAST). We quantify galactic environments by computing surrounding stellar densities of massive stars using Kernel Density Estimation. We then compare high-resolution line-of-sight extinction estimates from the BEAST with 25-pc resolution dust maps from PHAT, measuring the total column density distribution of extinction. Our key finding is that, although the average total column density of dust increases with the density of massive stars, the average line-of-sight extinction towards massive stars remains constant across all environments. This suggests that massive stars have a uniform amount of dust in their immediate environment, regardless of their location in the galaxy. One possible explanation for these findings is that small molecular clouds are still capable of forming massive stars, even if they are not resolvable at 25-pc. These results indicate that massive stars are forming in the sparse regions of M31, as opposed to migrating there.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from conducting a theoretical chemical analysis of a sample of benchmark companion brown dwarfs whose primary star is of type F, G or K. We summarize the entire known sample of these types of companion systems, termed "compositional benchmarks", that are present in the literature or recently published as key systems of study in order to best understand brown dwarf chemistry and condensate formation. Via mass balance and stoichiometric calculations, we predict a median brown dwarf atmospheric oxygen sink of $17.8^{+1.7}_{-2.3}\%$ by utilizing published stellar abundances in the local solar neighborhood. Additionally, we predict a silicate condensation sequence such that atmospheres with bulk Mg/Si $\lesssim$ 0.9 will form enstatite (MgSiO$_3$) and quartz (SiO$_2$) clouds and atmospheres with bulk Mg/Si $\gtrsim$ 0.9 will form enstatite and forsterite (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$) clouds. Implications of these results on C/O ratio trends in substellar mass objects and utility of these predictions in future modeling work are discussed.
#### Double-decker Pair of Flux Ropes Formed by Two Successive Tether-cutting  Eruptions

 - **Abstract**
 Double-decker filaments and their eruptions have been widely observed in recent years, but their physical formation mechanism is still unclear. Using high spatiotemporal resolution, multi-wavelength observations taken by the New Vacuum Solar Telescope and the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we show the formation of a double-decker pair of flux rope system by two successive tether-cutting eruptions in a bipolar active region. Due to the combined effect of photospheric shearing and convergence motions around the active region's polarity inversion line (PIL), the arms of two overlapping inverse-S-shaped short filaments reconnected at their intersection, which created a simultaneous upward-moving magnetic flux rope (MFR) and a downward-moving post-flare-loop (PFL) system striding the PIL. Meanwhile, four bright flare ribbons appeared at the footpoints of the newly formed MFR and the PFL. As the MFR rose, two elongated flare ribbons connected by a relatively larger PFL appeared on either side of the PIL. After a few minutes, another MFR formed in the same way at the same location and then erupted in the same direction as the first one. Detailed observational results suggest that the eruption of the first MFR might experienced a short pause before its successful eruption, while the second MFR was a failed eruption. This implies that the two newly formed MFRs might reach a new equilibrium at relatively higher heights for a while, which can be regarded as a transient double-decker flux rope system. The observations can well be explained by the tether-cutting model, and we propose that two successive confined tether-cutting eruptions can naturally produce a double-decker flux rope system, especially when the background coronal magnetic field has a saddle-like distribution of magnetic decay index profile in height.
#### Effect of cosmic rays and ionizing radiation on observational  ultraviolet plasma diagnostics in the circumgalactic medium

 - **Abstract**
 The relevance of some galactic feedback mechanisms, in particular cosmic ray feedback and the hydrogen ionizing radiation field, has been challenging to definitively describe in a galactic context, especially far outside the galaxy in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Theoretical and observational uncertainties prevent conclusive interpretations of multiphase CGM properties derived from ultraviolet (UV) diagnostics. We conduct three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a section of a galactic disk with star formation and feedback, including radiative heating from stars, a UV background, and cosmic ray feedback. We utilize the temperature phases present in our simulations to generate Cloudy models to derive spatially and temporally varying synthetic UV diagnostics. We find that radiative effects \hl{without additional heating mechanisms} are not able to produce synthetic diagnostics in the observed ranges. For low cosmic ray diffusivity $\kappa_{\rm{cr}}=10^{28} \rm{cm}^2 \rm{s}^{-1}$, cosmic ray streaming heating in the outflow helps our synthetic line ratios roughly match observed ranges by producing transitional temperature gas ($T \sim 10^{5-6}$ K). High cosmic ray diffusivity $\kappa_{\rm{cr}}=10^{29} \rm{cm}^2 \rm{s}^{-1}$, with or without cosmic ray streaming heating, produced transitional temperature gas. The key parameter controlling the production of this gas phase remains unclear, as the different star formation history and outflow evolution itself influences these diagnostics. Our work demonstrates the use of UV plasma diagnostics to differentiate between galactic/circumgalactic feedback models.
#### Tracing the ejecta from cosmic nucleosynthesis

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11474
 - **Abstract**
 Long-lived radioactive by-products of nucleosynthesis provide an opportunity to trace the flow of ejecta away from its sources for times beyond where ejecta can be seen otherwise. Gamma rays from such radioactive decay in interstellar space can be measured with space-borne telescopes. A prominent useful example is 26Al with a radioactive decay time of one My. Such observations have revealed that typical surroundings of massive stars are composed of large cavities, extending to kpc sizes. Implications are that material recycling into new stars is twofold: rather direct as parental clouds are hosts to new star formation triggered by feedback, and more indirect as these large cavities merge with ambient interstellar gas after some delay. Kinematic measurements of hot interstellar gas carrying such ejecta promises important measurements complementing stellar and dense gas kinematics.
#### Polarized Light from Massive Protoclusters (POLIMAP). I. Dissecting the  role of magnetic fields in the massive infrared dark cloud G28.37+0.07

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields may play a crucial role in setting the initial conditions of massive star and star cluster formation. To investigate this, we report SOFIA-HAWC+ $214\:\mu$m observations of polarized thermal dust emission and high-resolution GBT-Argus C$^{18}$O(1-0) observations toward the massive Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) G28.37+0.07. Considering the local dispersion of $B$-field orientations, we produce a map of $B$-field strength of the IRDC, which exhibits values between $\sim0.03 - 1\:$mG based on a refined Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (r-DCF) method proposed by Skalidis \& Tassis. Comparing to a map of inferred density, the IRDC exhibits a $B-n$ relation with a power law index of $0.51\pm0.02$, which is consistent with a scenario of magnetically-regulated anisotropic collapse. Consideration of the mass-to-flux ratio map indicates that magnetic fields are dynamically important in most regions of the IRDC. A virial analysis of a sample of massive, dense cores in the IRDC, including evaluation of magnetic and kinetic internal and surface terms, indicates consistency with virial equilibrium, sub-Alfv\'enic conditions and a dominant role for $B-$fields in regulating collapse. A clear alignment of magnetic field morphology with direction of steepest column density gradient is also detected. However, there is no preferred orientation of protostellar outflow directions with the $B-$field. Overall, these results indicate that magnetic fields play a crucial role in regulating massive star and star cluster formation and so need to be accounted for in theoretical models of these processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Three-dimensional modeling has reached a level of maturity to provide detailed predictions of the gravitational wave emission in neutrino-driven core collapse supernovae. We review the status of these modeling efforts, current predictions for core collapse supernova gravitational wave emission, and the status of algorithms for the detection of core collapse supernova gravitational waves and the estimation of physical parameters associated with these events, which we hope to use to cull information about the central engine.
#### The fast transient AT 2023clx in the nearby LINER galaxy NGC 3799, as a  tidal disruption event of a very low-mass star

 - **Abstract**
 We present an extensive analysis of the optical and UV properties of AT2023clx, the closest TDE to date, that occurred in the nucleus of the interacting LINER galaxy, NGC3799 (z=0.01107). From several standard methods, we estimate the mass of the central SMBH to be ~ 10^6 Msol. After correcting for the host reddening (E(B-V) = 0.177 mag) we measured its peak absolute g-band magnitude to be -18.25\pm0.05 mag, and its peak bolometric luminosity to be L_pk=(3.24\pm0.36)x10^43erg/s, making AT2023clx an intermediate luminosity TDE. The first distinctive feature of AT2023clx is that it rose to peak within only 10.4\pm2.5 days, making it the fastest rising TDE to date. Our SMBH mass estimate rules out the possibility of an intermediate mass BH as the reason of the fast rise. Dense spectral follow-up revealed a blue continuum that cools slowly and broad Balmer and HeII lines as well as weak HeI emission, features that are typically seen in TDEs. A flat Balmer decrement (~ 1.58) suggests that the lines are collisionally excited rather than being produced via photoionisation, as in typical active galactic nuclei. A second distinctive feature, seen for the first time in TDE spectra, is a sharp, narrow emission peak at a rest wavelength of ~6353 A. This feature is clearly visible up to 10d post-peak; we attribute it to clumpy material preceding the bulk outflow, and manifested as a high-velocity component of Ha (-9584km/s). The third distinctive feature is a break observed in the near-UV light curves that is reflected as a dip in the temperature evolution around ~18-28 days post-peak. Combining these findings, we propose a scenario for AT2023clx involving the disruption of a very low-mass star (<=0.1Msol) with an outflow launched in our line-of-sight with disruption properties that led to circularisation and prompt and efficient accretion disc formation, observed through a low-density photosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we conducted a detailed analysis of the core parameter of Warm Higgs Inflation (WHI) $-$ the dissipation coefficient ($Q$). As a crucial parameter in the warm inflation process, $Q$ exerts profound influences on the entire evolutionary process. By meticulously deriving the relationships between various quantities and $Q$, we successfully circumvented the common preconceptions regarding strong and weak dissipation, laying the foundation for a more accurate exploration of their interconnections. Taking into account the constraints imposed by Cosmic Microwave Background, we observed that the dissipation coefficient $Q$ remains at extremely low levels throughout the entire warm inflation process, i.e., $Q \ll 1$. This observation indicates that WHI falls under the category of weakly dissipative warm inflation. Despite being weakly dissipative, $Q$ still plays a crucial role in the evolution of temperature, energy, and other quantities, highlighting its significance and non-negligibility. We delved deeper into the impact of the primordial power spectrum on the dissipation coefficient $Q$ during the warm inflation process, discovering that the dependency is not significant. Consequently, this naturally leads to the unobtrusive dependence of the gravitational wave power spectrum on $Q$. Finally, we found that gravitational waves generated by WHI hold the potential for verification in future observational experiments, especially through the SKA100 experiment. These findings provide a theoretical support for a more profound understanding of the early evolution of the universe.
#### A theoretical framework for BL Her stars -- II. New period-luminosity  relations in the Gaia passbands

 - **Abstract**
 We present new theoretical period-luminosity (PL) and period-Wesenheit (PW) relations for a fine grid of convective BL Her, the shortest period T2Cs, models computed using MESA-RSP and compare our results with the empirical relations from Gaia DR3. We use the state-of-the-art 1D non-linear radial stellar pulsation tool MESA-RSP to compute models of BL Her stars over a wide range of input parameters - metallicity (-2.0 dex $\leq$ [Fe/H] $\leq$ 0.0 dex), stellar mass (0.5M$_{\odot}$-0.8M$_{\odot}$), stellar luminosity (50L$_{\odot}$-300L$_{\odot}$) and effective temperature (full extent of the instability strip; in steps of 50K). The BL Her stars in the All Sky region exhibit statistically different PL slopes compared to the theoretical PL slopes computed using the four sets of convection parameters. We find the empirical PL and PW slopes from BL Her stars in the Magellanic Clouds to be statistically consistent with the theoretical relations computed using the different convection parameter sets in the Gaia passbands. There is negligible effect of metallicity on the PL relations in the individual Gaia passbands. However, there exists a small but significant negative coefficient of metallicity in the PWZ relations for the BL Her models using the four sets of convection parameters. This could be attributed to the increased sensitivity of bolometric corrections to metallicities at wavelengths shorter than the V band. Our BL Her models also suggest a dependence of the mass-luminosity relation on metallicity. We found the observed Fourier parameter space to be covered well by our models. Higher mass models (> 0.6M$_{\odot}$) may be needed to reliably model the observed light curves of BL Her stars in the All Sky region. We also found the theoretical light curve structures (especially the Fourier amplitude parameters) to be affected by the choice of convection parameters.
#### Action and energy clustering of stellar streams in deforming Milky Way  dark matter haloes

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the non-adiabatic effect of time-dependent deformations in the Milky Way (MW) halo potential on stellar streams. Specifically, we consider the MW's response to the infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and how this impacts our ability to recover the spherically averaged MW mass profile from observation using stream actions. Previously, action clustering methods have only been applied to static or adiabatic MW systems to constrain the properties of the host system. We use a time-evolving MW--LMC simulation described by basis function expansions. We find that for streams with realistic observational uncertainties on shorter orbital periods and without close encounters with the LMC, e.g. GD-1, the radial action distribution is sufficiently clustered to locally recover the MW mass profile across the stream radial range within a 2 sigma confidence interval determined using a Fisher information approach. For streams with longer orbital periods and close encounters with the LMC, e.g. Orphan-Chenab (OC), the radial action distribution disperses as the MW halo has deformed non-adiabatically. Hence, for OC streams generated in potentials that include a MW halo with any deformations, action clustering methods will fail to recover the mass profile within a 2 sigma uncertainty. Finally, we investigate whether the clustering of stream energies can provide similar constraints. Surprisingly, we find for OC-like streams, the recovered spherically averaged mass profiles demonstrate less sensitivity to the time-dependent deformations in the potential.
#### Observations of magnetic reconnection in the deep solar atmosphere in  the H-epsilon line

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic reconnection in the deep solar atmosphere can give rise to enhanced emission in the Balmer hydrogen lines, a phenomenon known as Ellerman bombs (EBs). It is most common to observe EBs in the H-alpha and H-beta lines. High quality shorter wavelength Balmer line observations of EBs are rare but have the potential to provide the most highly resolved view on reconnection. We evaluate the H-epsilon 3970 A line as an EB diagnostic by analyzing high quality observations in different Balmer lines. Observations of different targets and viewing angles were acquired with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. These observations sample EBs in different environments: active regions, quiet Sun, and the penumbra and moat of a sunspot. We employed an automated detection method for quiet Sun EBs based on k-means clustering. Ellerman bombs in the H-epsilon line show similar characteristics as in the longer wavelength Balmer lines: enhanced intensity as compared to the surroundings, rapid variability, and flame-like morphology. In a 24 min quiet Sun time series, we detected 1674 EBs in the H-epsilon line which is 1.7 times more than in H-beta. The quiet Sun EBs measured in H-epsilon are very similar as in H-beta: they have similar lifetimes, area, brightness, and spatial distribution. Most of the EBs detected in H-epsilon are closer to the limb than their H-beta counterparts. This can be explained by the H-epsilon line core EB emission being formed higher in the atmosphere than the H-beta EB wing emission. We conclude that the H-epsilon line is well suited for studying EBs and consequently probes the dynamics of magnetic reconnection in the solar atmosphere at the smallest scales. Our findings suggests that the deep atmosphere in the quiet Sun may host more than 750,000 reconnection events with EB signature at any time. That is significantly more than what was found in earlier H-beta observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary disks, which are the natural consequence of the gravitational collapse of the dense molecular cloud cores, host the formation of the planetary systems known today in our universe. Numerous efforts have been dedicated to investigate the properties of these disks in the more mature Class II stage, either by using numerical simulations of disk evolution from a limited range of initial conditions or by observations of their dust continuum and line emission from specific molecular tracers, and to compare the results from the two standpoints. Yet few studies have investigated the main limitations at work when measuring the embedded Class 0/I disk properties from observations, especially in a statistical fashion. In this study, we provide a first attempt to compare the accuracy of some critical disk parameters in Class 0/I systems, as derived on real ALMA observational data, with the corresponding physical parameters that modellers can directly define in numerical simulations. The approach we follow is to provide full post-processing of the numerical simulations and apply on the synthetic observations the same techniques used by observers to derive the physical parameters. To that end, we performed 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer and mock interferometric observations of the disk populations formed in an MHD simulation model of disk formation through the collapse of massive clumps with the tools RADMC-3D and CASA, respectively, to obtain their synthetic observations. With these observations, we re-employ the techniques commonly used in disk modelling from their continuum emissions to infer their properties that one would likely obtain if one observed them with real interferometers. We then demonstrate how their properties vary from the gas kinematics analyses to the dust continuum modelling.
#### Wolf 327b: A new member of the pack of ultra-short-period super-Earths  around M dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 Planets with orbital periods shorter than 1 day are rare and have formation histories that are not completely understood. Small ($R_\mathrm{p} < 2\; R_\oplus$) ultra-short-period (USP) planets are highly irradiated, probably have rocky compositions with high bulk densities, and are often found in multi-planet systems. Additionally, USP planets found around small stars are excellent candidates for characterization using present-day instrumentation. Of the current full sample of approximately 5500 confirmed exoplanets, only 130 are USP planets and around 40 have mass and radius measurements. Wolf 327 (TOI-5747) is an M dwarf ($R_\star = 0.406 \pm 0.015 \; R_\odot$, $M_\star = 0.405 \pm 0.019 \; M_\odot$, $T_{\mathrm{eff}}=3542 \pm 70$ K, and $V = 13$ mag) located at a distance $d = 28.5$ pc. NASA's planet hunter satellite, TESS, detected transits in this star with a period of 0.573 d (13.7 h) and with a transit depth of 818 ppm. Ground-based follow-up photometry, high resolution imaging, and radial velocity (RV) measurements taken with the CARMENES spectrograph confirm the presence of this new USP planet. Wolf 327b is a super-Earth with a radius of $R_\mathrm{p} = 1.24 \pm 0.06 \; R_\oplus$ and a mass of $M_\mathrm{p} = 2.53 \pm 0.46 \; M_\oplus$, yielding a bulk density of $7.24 \pm 1.66 $\,g cm$^{-3}$ and thus suggesting a rocky composition. Owing to its close proximity to its host star ($a = 0.01$ au), Wolf 327b has an equilibrium temperature of $996 \pm 22$ K. This planet has a mass and radius similar to K2-229b, a planet with an inferred Mercury-like internal composition. Planet interior models suggest that Wolf 327b has a large iron core, a small rocky mantle, and a negligible (if any) H/He atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 With the goal of matching spacecraft measurements from Juno and Galileo missions, we construct ensembles of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 layer models for Jupiter's interior. All except our two layer models can match the planet's gravity field as measured by the Juno spacecraft. We find, however, that some model types are more plausible than others. In the best three layer models, for example, the transition from molecular to metallic hydrogen needs to be at ~500 GPa while theory and experiments place this transition at ~100 GPa. Four layer models with a single sharp boundary between core and mantle would be short-lived due to rapid convective core erosion. For this reason, we favor our five layer models that include a dilute core surrounded by a stably stratified core transition layer. Six layer models with a small compact core are also possible but with an upper limit of 3 Earth masses for such a compact core. All models assume a 1 bar temperature of 166.1 K, employ physical equations of state, and are constructed with the nonperturbative Concentric Maclaurin Spheroid (CMS) method. We analyze the convergence of this method and describe technical steps that are needed to make this technique so efficient that ensembles of models can be generated.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the limits of rocky planet habitability is one of the key goals of current and future exoplanet characterization efforts. An intrinsic concept of rocky planet habitability is the Habitable Zone. To date, the most widely used estimates of the Habitable Zone are based on cloud-free, one-dimensional (vertical) radiative-convective climate model calculations. However, recent three-dimensional global climate modeling efforts have revealed that rocky planet habitability is strongly impacted by radiative cloud feedbacks, where computational expense and model limitations can prevent these tools from exploring the limits of habitability across the full range of parameter space. We leverage a patchy cloud one-dimensional radiative-convective climate model with parameterized cloud microphysics to investigate Inner Edge limits to the Habitable Zone for main sequence stars ($T_{\rm eff}$ = 2600 -7200K). We find that Inner Edge limits to the Habitable Zone can be 3.3 and 4.7 times closer than previous cloud-free estimates for Earth- and super-Earth-sized worlds, respectively, depending on bulk cloud parameters (e.g., fractional cloudiness and sedimentation efficiency). These warm, moist Inner Edge climates are expected to have extensive cloud decks that could mute deep atmosphere spectral features. To aid in rocky planet characterization studies, we identify the potential of using $\rm{CO_{\rm 2}}$ absorption features in transmission spectroscopy as a means of quantifying cloud deck height and cloud sedimentation efficiency. Moist greenhouse climates may represent key yet poorly understood states of habitable planets for which continued study will uncover new insights into the search and characterization of habitable worlds.
