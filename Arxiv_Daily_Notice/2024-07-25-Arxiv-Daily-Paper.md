 - **Abstract**
 Relativistic jets from a black hole (BH) following the core-collapse of a massive star (''collapsar'') is a leading model for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, the two key ingredients for a Blandford-Znajek (BZ) powered jet $-$ rapid rotation and a strong magnetic field $-$ seem mutually exclusive. Strong fields in the progenitor star's core transport angular momentum outwards more quickly, slowing down the core before collapse. Using MESA stellar evolution models followed to core-collapse, we explicitly show that the small length-scale of the instabilities, likely responsible for angular momentum transport in the core (e.g., Tayler-Spruit), results in a low net magnetic flux fed to the BH horizon, far too small to power GRB jets. Instead, we propose a novel scenario in which collapsar BHs acquire their magnetic ''hair'' from their progenitor proto-neutron star (PNS), which is likely highly magnetized from an internal dynamo. We evaluate the conditions for the BH accretion disk to pin the PNS magnetosphere to its horizon immediately after the collapse. Our results show that the PNS's pre-collapse energy matches the excess energy in Ic-BL supernovae, while the nascent BH's spin and magnetic flux produce jets consistent with observed GRB characteristics. We map our MESA models to 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations and confirm that accretion disks confine the strong magnetic flux initiated near a rotating BH, enabling the launch of successful GRB jets, whereas a slower spinning BH or one without a disk fails to do so. Our model indicates that standard GRB jets emerge whenever an accretion disk forms.

 - **Abstract**
 Bringing artificial intelligence (AI) alongside next-generation X-ray imaging detectors, including CCDs and DEPFET sensors, enhances their sensitivity to achieve many of the flagship science cases targeted by future X-ray observatories, based upon low surface brightness and high redshift sources. Machine learning algorithms operating on the raw frame-level data provide enhanced identification of background vs. astrophysical X-ray events, by considering all of the signals in the context within which they appear within each frame. We have developed prototype machine learning algorithms to identify valid X-ray and cosmic-ray induced background events, trained and tested upon a suite of realistic end-to-end simulations that trace the interaction of cosmic ray particles and their secondaries through the spacecraft and detector. These algorithms demonstrate that AI can reduce the unrejected instrumental background by up to 41.5 per cent compared with traditional filtering methods. Alongside AI algorithms to reduce the instrumental background, next-generation event reconstruction methods, based upon fitting physically-motivated Gaussian models of the charge clouds produced by events within the detector, promise increased accuracy and spectral resolution of the lowest energy photon events.
#### Tracing the Milky Way spiral arms with 26Al -- The role of nova systems in the 2D distribution of 26Al

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars are one of the most important and investigated astrophysical production sites of $^{26}$Al, a short-lived radioisotope with $\sim$ 1 Myr half-life. Its short lifetime prevents us from observing its complete chemical history, and only the $^{26}$Al that was recently produced by massive stars can be observed. Hence, it is considered a tracer of star formation rate (SFR). However, important contributions to $^{26}$Al comes from nova systems that pollute the interstellar medium with a large delay, thus partly erasing the correlation between $^{26}$Al and SFR. In this work we describe the 2D distribution of the mass of $^{26}$Al as well as that of massive stars and nova systems in the Milky Way, to investigate their relative contributions to the production of $^{26}$Al. We use a detailed 2D chemical evolution model where the SFR is azimuthally dependent and is required to reproduce the spiral arm pattern observed in the Milky Way. We test two different models, one where the $^{26}$Al comes from massive stars and novae, and one with massive stars only. We then compare the predictions to the $\sim$ 2 M$_{\odot}$ of $^{26}$Al mass observed by the surveys COMPTEL and INTEGRAL. The results show that novae do not trace SFR and, in the solar vicinity, they concentrate in its minima. The effect of novae on the map of the $^{26}$Al mass consists in damping the spiral pattern by a factor of five. Regarding the nucleosynthesis, we find that $\sim$75% of the $^{26}$Al is produced by novae and the $\sim$25% by massive stars. We conclude that novae cannot be neglected as $^{26}$Al producers since the observations can only be reproduced by including their contribution. Moreover, we suggest that bulge novae should eject around six times more material than the disc ones to well reproduce the observed mass of $^{26}$Al.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot, \logT\ $\sim$ 7.5, gas was recently discovered in the Milky Way in extragalactic sightlines. In order to determine its location, here we present sightlines to Galactic X-ray binaries (XRBs) passing through the Interstellar Medium (ISM). In this pilot study we investigate absorption features of \SXVI, \SiXIV, and \NeX\ in the spectra of three XRBs, namely 4U 1735-44, 4U 1820-30, and Cyg X-2, using Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating archival observations. We do not detect any of these lines. {We determine the 2$\sigma$ upper limit for the equivalent widths of the undetected absorption lines and the column densities of the corresponding ions.} We note that the 2$\sigma$ upper limits for \SXVI\ \Ka\ and \SiXIV\ \Ka\ are an order of magnitude smaller than those previously detected in the extragalactic sightlines. Our finding suggests that if any gas at \logT\ $>7$ is present in the Galactic ISM, it is unlikely to be ubiquitous. This is an important result because it implies that \SXVI, \SiXIV\ {and \NeX\ }absorption detected in extragalactic sightlines is not from the ISM, but is likely from a hot gas phase in the extraplanar region beyond the ISM or in the extended CGM.

 - **Abstract**
 The interpretation of gamma-ray emission originating from the solar disk ($0.5^\circ$ in angular size) as due to the interaction of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) with the solar atmosphere has remained a central challenge in solar physics. After the seminal work by Seckel, Stanev, and Gaisser (SSG91) based on GCRs magnetic mirroring, discrepancies between models and observations persist, indicating the need for a novel approach. The present work focuses on exploring the impact of a closed magnetic field geometry in the low photosphere on the observed gamma-ray flux. We track numerically with the PLUTO code the trajectories of test-particle protons within a static $\sim 20$ Mm scale height magnetic arcade adjacent to jets. By making use of numerical vertical density profiles we inject particles at distinct chromospheric/photospheric altitudes, mimicking the migration of GCRs from neighboring flux tubes into closed arcades. Remarkably, our model reproduces a flat gamma-ray spectrum below $\sim 33$ GeV, a nearly-isotropic emission at $\sim 10$ GeV, both consistent with Fermi-LAT observations, and a near-limb emission at $\sim 1$ TeV. Our model can also reproduce the flux-drop detected by HAWC ($\sim 1$ TeV). Finally, we argue that the spectral dip observed at $\sim$ 40 GeV may result from the flux suppression at low energy due to the cross-field diffusion, which would produce a cutoff. These findings underscore the pivotal role of closed magnetic field structures in shaping the solar disk gamma-ray emission.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar scintillation can be used to measure small scale structure in the Galaxy, but little is known about the specific interstellar medium features that cause scintillation. We searched for interstellar medium counterparts to all scintillation screens for which absolute distances and scattering orientations have been measured - a sample of 12 pulsars and 22 screens. For one pulsar, PSR J0737-3039A, we re-analyze its scintillation screen and find evidence for a highly anisotropic screen. Among the screens, we found that eight are located inside of the Local Bubble, and a further six are less than 100 pc farther than its inner edge. Comparisons with tracers of ionized and magnetized media did not find any new associations. Instead, for seven of the pulsars analyzed, aligned HI filaments are seen for at least one of their screens, for a total of 12 out of 22 screens. This result seems unlikely to be due to chance: comparing with random trials, we estimate a likelihood of finding 12 or more screens with aligned emission by chance of only 0.004%. Estimating the significance of the amount of aligned emission (in standard deviations over the mean), the probability of finding as much observed aligned emission by chance is larger, at 1.7%, but still indicative of a real correlation. Since HI filaments are preferentially associated with cold neutral gas, and thus unlikely to cause scintillation, this may indicate both the filaments and the screens are aligned preferentially by the same mechanisms such as magnetic fields or shocks.
#### ACA CO(J=2-1) Mapping of the Nearest Spiral Galaxy M33. II. Exploring the Evolution of Giant Molecular Clouds

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs), the main sites of high-mass star formation, is an essential process to unravel the galaxy evolution. Using a GMC catalogue of M33 from ALMA-ACA survey, we classified 848 GMCs into three types based on the association with HII regions and their H$\alpha$ luminosities $\textit{L}$(H$\alpha$): Type I is associated with no HII regions; Type II with HII regions of $\textit{L}$(H$\alpha$) $<$ 10$^{37.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$; and Type III with HII regions of $\textit{L}$(H$\alpha$) $\geqq$ 10$^{37.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$. These criteria yield 224 Type I GMCs, 473 Type II GMCs, and 151 Type III GMCs. GMCs show changes in their physical properties according to the types; mass, radius, velocity dispersion, and $^{13}$CO detection rate of GMCs systematically increase from Type I to Type III, and additionally, Type III GMCs are closest to virial equilibrium. Type III GMCs show the highest spatial correlation with clusters younger than 10 Myr, Type II GMCs moderate correlation, and Type I GMCs are almost uncorrelated. We interpret that these types indicate an evolutionary sequence from Type I to Type II, and then to Type III with timescales of 4 Myr, 13 Myr, and 5 Myr, respectively, indicating the GMC lifetime of 22 Myr by assuming that Type II GMC has the same timescale as the Large Magellanic Cloud. The evolved GMCs concentrate on the spiral arms, while the younger GMCs are apart from the arm both to the leading and trailing sides. This indicated that GMCs collide with each other by the spiral potential, leading to the compression of GMCs and the triggering of high-mass star formation, which may support the dynamic spiral model. Overall, we suggest that the GMC evolution concept helps illuminate the galaxy evolution, including the spiral arm formation.
#### Discovery of a Damped Ly$\alpha$ Absorber in the Circumnuclear Zone of the FeLoBAL Quasar SDSS J083942.11+380526.3

 - **Abstract**
 SDSS J083942.11+380526.3 ($z=2.315$) is a FeLoBAL quasar that exhibits visible Balmer absorption lines (H$\alpha$), implying a significant $n=2$ population. The quasar also shows an array of absorption lines, including \oi, \niii, \feii, \mgii, \aliii\, to \civ\ and \nv. The high-ionization absorption lines such as \civ\ and \siiv\ are revealed by slightly blueshifted BAL troughs. The resonance doublets such as \mgii\ and \aliii\ are saturated but did not reached zero intensity which indicates that the BLR is partially covered. Overall, however, the absorption is predominantly from low-ionization \feii\ lines, emitted from ground and excited states up to at least 3.814 eV. This implies that the absorbing gas spans the hydrogen ionization front and extends into the partially ionized zone where neutral hydrogen is certainly present. Notably, the hydrogen line spectrum of the quasar shows no signature of expected Ly$\alpha$ absorption. Instead, the line spectrum shows an unusual Ly$\alpha$ emission characterized by a fully filled emission line spectrum which is a composite of a strong narrow core superposed on a weak broad base. Taking into account the effect of partial covering to BLR, we have extracted a strong DLA trough in Ly$\alpha$ emission region. To fit the spectrum, we performed photoionized model calculations and compared them to the observations. We found that photoionization modeling using CLOUDY can successfully reproduce the main characteristics of the quasar spectrum, and the predicted neutral hydrogen column density arising from the clouds responsible for the low-ionization absorption provides a good match to the extracted DLA trough. This indicates that both the DLA and the low-ionization absorption arise from the same medium that is roughly collocated with the dusty torus.

 - **Abstract**
 [Abridged] AGB stars are significant contributors to the metal enrichment of the interstellar medium. In this paper, we adapted models from advanced RHD simulations as input for radiative transfer software to create synthetic observables. A major goal is to describe an AGB star's non-sphericity and to simulate its effects on the surrounding dusty envelope. We developed tools to translate models of an AGB star and its dust-driven wind from simulations with CO5BOLD into the format used by RADMC-3D. We preserved the asymmetric shape of the star by including it as a `dust species' and by using temperature data computed in CO5BOLD. Circumstellar dust is included using Mg2SiO4 opacity data with spatially dependent grain sizes. We compared images and SEDs created with RADMC-3D of a model with similar output made with a spherically symmetric star. Our CO5BOLD model features substantial and clumpy dust formation just above 3.4 au from the grid centre, and large-scale structures due to giant convection cells are visible on the stellar surface. With the properties of VLTI as a basis, we have created simple synthetic observables. Such optical interferometers should be able to detect these dust clouds. We find that it is important to include asymmetric stellar models since they even affect the SEDs. Effects on flux levels can be linked to the clumpiness of the circumstellar dust and the angle-dependent illumination resulting from temperature variations on the stellar surface causes shifts in the wavelengths of the flux maximum. The methods presented here are an important step towards producing realistic synthetic observables and testing predictions of advanced 3D RHD models. Taking the angle-dependence of SEDs as a proxy for temporal variations in unresolved data, we conclude that not all variability observed in AGB stars should be interpreted as global changes in the sense of spherical models.
#### Climate Change in Hell: Long-Term Variation in Transits of the Evaporating Planet K2-22b

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Rocky planets on ultra-short period orbits can have surface magma oceans and rock-vapour atmospheres in which dust can condense. Observations of that dust can inform about the composition surface conditions on these objects. Aims: We constrain the properties and long-term (decade) behaviour of the transiting dust cloud from the "evaporating" planet K2-22b. Methods: We observed K2-22b around 40 predicted transits with MuSCAT ground-based multi-optical channel imagers, and complemented these data with long-term monitoring by the ground-based ATLAS (2018-2024) and space-based TESS (2021-2023) surveys. Results: We detected signals during 7 transits, none of which showed significant wavelength dependence. The expected number of MuSCAT-detected transits is >=22, indicating a decline in mean transit depth since the K2 discovery observations in 2014. Conclusions: Lack of significant wavelength dependence indicates that dust grains are large or the cloud is optically thick. Long-term trends of depth could be due to a magnetic cycle on the host star or overturn of the planet's dayside surface magma ocean. The possibility that K2-22b is disappearing altogether is ruled out by the stability of the transit ephemeris against non-gravitational forces, which constrains the mass to be at least comparable to Ceres.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the effects of cosmic ray interactions with the Kinetic Inductance Detector (KID) based focal plane array for the Terahertz Intensity Mapper (TIM). TIM is a NASA-funded balloon-borne experiment designed to probe the peak of the star formation in the Universe. It employs two spectroscopic bands, each equipped with a focal plane of four $\sim\,$900-pixel, KID-based array chips. Measurements of an 864-pixel TIM array shows 791 resonators in a 0.5$\,$GHz bandwidth. We discuss challenges with resonator calibration caused by this high multiplexing density. We robustly identify the physical positions of 788 (99.6$\,$%) detectors using a custom LED-based identification scheme. Using this information we show that cosmic ray events occur at a rate of 2.1$\,\mathrm{events/min/cm^2}$ in our array. 66$\,$% of the events affect a single pixel, and another 33$\,$% affect $<\,$5 KIDs per event spread over a 0.66$\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ region (2 pixel pitches in radius). We observe a total cosmic ray dead fraction of 0.0011$\,$%, and predict that the maximum possible in-flight dead fraction is $\sim\,$0.165$\,$%, which demonstrates our design will be robust against these high-energy events.
