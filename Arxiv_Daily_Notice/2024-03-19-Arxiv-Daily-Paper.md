#### Stellar Mergers or Truly Young? Intermediate-Age Stars on Highly-Radial  Orbits in the Milky Way's Stellar Halo

 - **Abstract**
 Reconstructing the mass assembly history of the Milky Way relies on obtaining detailed measurements of the properties of many stars in the Galaxy, especially in the stellar halo. One of the most constraining quantities is stellar age, as it can shed light on the accretion time and quenching of star formation in merging satellites. However, obtaining reliable age estimates for large samples of halo stars is difficult. We report published ages of 120 subgiant halo stars with highly-radial orbits that likely belong to the debris of the $Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage$ (GES) galaxy. The majority of these halo stars are old, with an age distribution characterized by a median of 11.6~Gyr and 16$^{\rm th}$(84$^{\rm th}$) percentile of 10.5~(12.7)~Gyr. However, the distribution is skewed, with a tail of younger stars that span ages down to $\sim6$-$9$ Gyr. All highly-radial halo stars have chemical and kinematic/orbital quantities that associate them with the GES debris. Initial results suggest that these intermediate-age stars are not a product of mass transfer and/or stellar mergers, which can bias their age determination low. If this conclusion is upheld by upcoming spectro-photometric studies, then the presence of these stars will pose an important challenge for constraining the properties of the GES merger and the accretion history of the Galaxy.
#### Formation of Large Circumstellar Discs in Multi-scale, ideal-MHD  Simulations of Magnetically Critical Pre-stellar Cores

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of circumstellar discs is a critical step in the formation of stars and planets. Magnetic fields can strongly affect the evolution of angular momentum during prestellar core collapse, potentially leading to the failure of protostellar disc formation. This phenomenon, known as the magnetic braking catastrophe, has been observed in ideal-MHD simulations. In this work, we present results from ideal-MHD simulations of circumstellar disc formation from realistic initial conditions of strongly magnetised, massive cores with masses between $30 ~{\rm M}_\odot$ and $300 ~{\rm M}_\odot$ resolved by zooming into Giant Molecular Clouds with masses $\sim 10^4 \ {\rm M}_\odot$ and initial mass-to-flux ratios $0.6 \le \mu_0 \le 3$. Due to the large turbulence caused by the non-axisymmetric gravitational collapse of the gas, the dominant vertical support of discs is turbulent motion, while magnetic and turbulent pressures contribute equally in the outer toroid. The magnetic field topology is extremely turbulent and incoherent, reducing the effect of magnetic braking by roughly one order of magnitude and leading to the formation of large Keplerian discs even in magnetically critical or near-critical cores. Only cores in GMCs with $\mu_0 < 1$ fail to form discs. Instead, they collapse into a sheet-like structure and produce numerous low-mass stars. We also discuss a universal $B-\rho$ relation valid over a large range of scales from the GMC to massive cores, irrespective of the GMC magnetisation. This study differs from the vast literature on this topic which typically focus on smaller mass discs with idealised initial and boundary conditions, therefore providing insights into the initial conditions of massive prestellar core collapse and disc formation.
#### The Bright Rim Prominences according to 2.5D Radiative Transfer

 - **Abstract**
 Solar prominences observed close to the limb commonly include a bright feature that, from the perspective of the observer, runs along the interface between itself and the underlying chromosphere. Despite several idealised models being proposed to explain the underlying physics, a more general approach remains outstanding. In this manuscript we demonstrate as a proof-of-concept the first steps in applying the Lightweaver radiative transfer framework's 2.5D extension to a `toy' model prominence + VAL3C chromosphere, inspired by recent 1.5D experiments that demonstrated a significant radiative chromosphere--prominence interaction. We find the radiative connection to be significant enough to enhance both the electron number density within the chromosphere, as well as its emergent intensity across a range of spectral lines in the vicinity of the filament absorption signature. Inclining the viewing angle from the vertical, we find these enhancements to become increasingly asymmetric and merge with a larger secondary enhancement sourced directly from the prominence underside. In wavelength, the enhancements are then found to be the largest in both magnitude and horizontal extent for the spectral line cores, decreasing into the line wings. Similar behaviour is found within new Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar Explorer (CHASE)/H$\alpha$ Imaging Spectrograph (HIS) observations, opening the door for subsequent statistical confirmations of the theoretical basis we develop here.
#### Predicting the Scaling Relations between the Dark Matter Halo Mass and  Observables from Generalised Profiles II: Intracluster Gas Emission

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the connection between a cluster's structural configuration and observable measures of its gas emission that can be obtained in X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) surveys. We present an analytic model for the intracluster gas density profile: parameterised by the dark matter halo's inner logarithmic density slope, $\alpha$, the concentration, $c$, the gas profile's inner logarithmic density slope, $\varepsilon$, the dilution, $d$, and the gas fraction, $\eta$, normalised to cosmological content. We predict four probes of the gas emission: the emission-weighted, $T_\mathrm{X}$, and mean gas mass-weighted, $T_\mathrm{m_g}$, temperatures, and the spherically, $Y_\mathrm{sph}$, and cylindrically, $Y_\mathrm{cyl}$, integrated Compton parameters. Over a parameter space of clusters, we constrain the X-ray temperature scaling relations, $M_{200} - T_\mathrm{X}$ and $M_{500} - T_\mathrm{X}$, within $57.3\%$ and $41.6\%$, and $M_{200} - T_\mathrm{m_g}$ and $M_{500} - T_\mathrm{m_g}$, within $25.7\%$ and $7.0\%$, all respectively. When excising the cluster's core, the $M_{200} - T_\mathrm{X}$ and $M_{500} - T_\mathrm{X}$ relations are further constrained, to within $31.3\%$ and $17.1\%$, respectively. Similarly, we constrain the SZ scaling relations, $M_{200} - Y_\mathrm{sph}$ and $M_{500} - Y_\mathrm{sph}$, within $31.1\%$ and $17.7\%$, and $M_{200} - Y_\mathrm{cyl}$ and $M_{500} - Y_\mathrm{cyl}$, within $25.2\%$ and $22.0\%$, all respectively. The temperature observable $T_\mathrm{m_g}$ places the strongest constraint on the halo mass, whilst $T_\mathrm{X}$ is more sensitive to the parameter space. The SZ constraints are sensitive to the gas fraction, whilst insensitive to the form of the gas profile itself. In all cases, the halo mass is recovered with an uncertainty that suggests the cluster's structural profiles only contribute a minor uncertainty in its scaling relations.
#### Revealing mysteries in gamma-ray bursts: the role of gluon condensation

 - **Abstract**
 We use a special gluon distribution in the nucleon, which was predicted by a QCD evolution equation to consistently explain several intriguing phenomena associated with gamma-ray bursts. They are the GeV-TeV spectra of GRB 221009A, the remarkably symmetrical explosion cloud in kilonova AT2017gfo, and the absence of a very high-energy gamma-ray signature in GRB 170817A. We find that these occurrences can be attributed to the gluon condensation within nucleons, i.e., a significant number of soft gluons within nucleons are condensed at a critical momentum, resulting in the emergence of a steep and high peak in the gluon distributions. Through this profound connection between microscopic and macroscopic phenomena, we have not only expanded the applications of the hadronic scenario in cosmic gamma-ray emissions but also presented new evidence for the existence of gluon condensation.

 - **Abstract**
 Intervening metal absorbers in quasar spectra at $z > 6$ can be used as probes to study the chemical enrichment of the Universe during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). This work presents the comoving line densities ($dn/dX$) of low ionisation absorbers, namely, Mg II (2796\r{A}), C II (1334\r{A}) and O I (1302\r{A}) across $2 <z < 6$ using the E-XQR-30 metal absorber catalog prepared from 42 XSHOOTER quasar spectra at $5.8 < z < 6.6$. Here, we analyse 280 Mg II ($1.9 < z < 6.4$), 22 C II ($5.2 < z < 6.4$) and 10 O I ($5.3 < z < 6.4$) intervening absorbers, thereby building up on previous studies with improved sensitivity of 50% completeness at an equivalent width of $W > 0.03$\r{A}. For the first time, we present the comoving line densities of 131 weak ($W < 0.3$\r{A}) intervening Mg II absorbers at $1.9 < z < 6.4$ which exhibit constant evolution with redshift similar to medium ($0.3 < W < 1.0$\r{A}) absorbers. However, the cosmic mass density of Mg II - dominated by strong Mg II systems - traces the evolution of global star formation history from redshift 1.9 to 5.5. E-XQR-30 also increases the absorption path length by a factor of 50% for C II and O I whose line densities show a rising trend towards $z > 5$, in agreement with previous works. In the context of a decline in metal enrichment of the Universe at $z > 5$, the overall evolution in the incidence rates of absorption systems can be explained by a weak - possibly soft fluctuating - UV background. Our results, thereby, provide evidence for a late reionization continuing to occur in metal-enriched and therefore, biased regions in the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Abell 3667 is a near-by (z=0.056) merging cluster with the most prominent cold front and a pair of two bright radio relics. Assuming a face-to-face merger scenario, the origin of the cold front is often considered to be a remnant core of the cluster stripped of its surrounding ICM. Sarazin et al. (2016) proposed an offset merger scenario in which the sub-cluster cores rotate after the first core-crossing. To distinguish between these scenarios, we revisited the ICM distribution and measured the line-of-sight bulk ICM velocity using a calibration technique proposed by Sanders et al. (2020). In the unsharp masked image, we identified several ICM features, some of which we detected for the first time. There is an enhancement of the X-ray surface brightness extending from the 1st BCG to the cold front, which is named the "BCG-E tail". The notable feature is the "RG1 vortex", which is a clockwise vortex-like enhancement with a radius of about 250 kpc connecting the 1st BCG to the radio galaxy (RG1). It is particularly enhanced near the north of the 1st BCG, which is named the "BCG-N tail". The thermodynamic map shows that the ICM in the RG1 vortex has a relatively high abundance of 0.5-0.6 solar compared to the surrounding regions. The ICM of the BCG-E tail also has high abundance, and low pseudo-entropy, and can be interpreted as the remnant of the ICM of the cluster core. Including its arc-like shape, the RG1 vortex supports the idea that the ICM around the cluster center is rotating, which is natural in an offset merger scenario. The results of the line-of-sight bulk ICM velocity measurement show that the ICM around the BCG-N tail is redshifted with a velocity difference of 940$\pm$440 km s$^{-1}$ compared to the optical redshift of the 1st BCG. Other symptoms of diversity in the line-of-sight velocity of the ICM were also obtained and discussed in the context of the offset merger.
#### Virial Black Hole Masses for AGNs behind the Magellanic Clouds

 - **Abstract**
 We use the spectroscopic data collected by the Magellanic Quasars Survey (MQS) as well as the photometric V- and I-band data from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) to measure the physical parameters for active galactic nuclei (AGNs) located behind the Magellanic Clouds. The flux-uncalibrated MQS spectra were obtained with the 4-m Anglo-Australian Telescope and the AAOmega spectroscope (R=1300) in a typical ~1.5-hour visit. They span a spectral range of 3700-8500 Angstroms and have S/N ratios in a range of 3-300. We report the discovery and observational properties of 161 AGNs in this footprint, which expands the total number of spectroscopically confirmed AGNs by MQS to 919. After converting the OGLE mean magnitudes to the monochromatic luminosities at 5100 Angstroms, 3000 Angstroms, and 1350 Angstroms, we reliably measured the black hole masses for 165 out of 919 AGNs. The remaining physical parameters we provide are the bolometric luminosities and the Eddington ratios. A fraction of these AGNs have been observed by the OGLE survey since 1997 (all of them since 2001), enabling studies of correlations between their variability and physical parameters.
#### Constraining Protoplanetary Disk Winds from Forbidden Line Profiles with  Simulation-based Inference

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary disks are the sites of vigorous hydrodynamic processes, such as accretion and outflows, and ultimately establish the conditions for the formation of planets. The properties of disk outflows are often inferred through analysis of forbidden emission lines. These lines contain multiple overlapping components, tracing different emission regions with different processes that excite them: a high-velocity component (tracing a jet), a broad low-velocity component (tracing inner disk wind), and a narrow low-velocity component (tracing outer disk wind). They are also heavily contaminated by background spectral features. All of these challenges call into question the traditional approach of fitting Gaussian components to the line profiles, and cloud the physical interpretation of those components. We introduce a novel statistical technique to analyze emission lines in protoplanetary disks. Simulation-Based Inference is a computationally efficient machine learning technique that produces posterior distributions of the parameters (e.g. magnetic field, radiation sources, geometry) of a representative wind model when given a spectrum, without any prior assumption about line shapes (e.g.symmetry). In this pathfinder study, we demonstrate that this technique indeed accurately recovers the parameters from simulated spectra without noise and background. A following work will deal with the analysis of observed spectra.
#### Spectroscopic Observations of the Solar Corona during the 2017 August 21  Total Solar Eclipse: Comparison of Spectral Line Widths and Doppler Shifts  Between Open and Closed Magnetic Structures

 - **Abstract**
 The spectroscopic observations presented here were acquired during the 2017 August 21 total solar eclipse with a three-channel partially multiplexed imaging spectrometer (3PAMIS) operating at extremely high orders ($>$ 50). The 4 $R_\odot$ extent of the slit in the North-South direction scanned the corona starting from the central meridian out to approximately 1.0 $R_\odot$ off the east limb throughout totality. The line widths and Doppler shifts of the Fe X (637.4 nm) and Fe XIV (530.3 nm) emission lines, characteristic of $1.1 \times 10^6$ K and $1.8 \times 10^6$ K electron temperatures respectively, varied across the different coronal structures intercepted by the slit. Fe XIV was the dominant emission in the closed fields of an active region and the base of a streamer, with relatively constant 20 - 30 km s$^{-1}$ line widths independent of the height. In contrast, Fe X emission exhibited broader ($>40 $km s$^{-1}$) line widths in open fields which increased with height, in particular in the polar coronal hole. Inferences of line widths and Doppler shifts were consistent with extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations from Hinode/EIS, as well as with the near-infrared Fe XIII 1074 nm line observed by CoMP. The differences in the spectral line widths between distinct coronal structures are interpreted as an indication of the predominance of wave heating in open structures versus localized heating in closed structures. This study underscores the unparalleled advantages and the enormous potential of TSE spectroscopy in measuring line widths simultaneously in open and closed fields at high altitudes, with minimal exposure times, stray light levels, and instrumental widths.
#### Comparative study of the kinetic properties of proton and alpha beams in  the Alfvénic wind observed by SWA-PAS onboard Solar Orbiter

 - **Abstract**
 The problems of heating and acceleration of solar wind particles are of significant and enduring interest in astrophysics. The interactions between waves and particles are crucial in determining the distributions of proton and alpha particles, resulting in non-Maxwellian characteristics including temperature anisotropies and particle beams. These processes can be better understood as long as the beam can be separated from the core for the two major components of the solar wind. We utilized an alternative numerical approach that leverages the clustering technique employed in Machine Learning to differentiate the primary populations within the velocity distribution, rather than employing the conventional biMaxwellian fitting method. Separation of the core and beam revealed new features for protons and alphas. We estimated that the total temperature of the two beams was slightly higher than that of their respective cores, and the temperature anisotropy for the cores and beams was larger than 1. We concluded that the temperature ratio between alphas and protons largely over 4 is due to the presence of a massive alpha beam, which is approximately 50% of the alpha core. We provided evidence that the alpha core and beam populations are sensitive to Alfv\'enic fluctuations and the surfing effect found in the literature can be recovered only when considering the core and beam as a single population. Several similarities between proton and alpha beams would suggest a common and local generation mechanism not shared with the alpha core, which may not have necessarily been accelerated and heated locally.
