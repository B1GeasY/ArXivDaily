 - **Abstract**
 The transport of energy through convection is important during many stages of stellar evolution, and is best studied in our Sun or giant evolved stars. Features that are attributed to convection are found on the surface of massive red supergiant stars. Also for lower mass evolved stars, indications of convection are found, but convective timescales and sizes remain poorly constrained. Models indicate that convective motions are crucial for the production of strong winds that return the products of stellar nucleosynthesis into the interstellar medium. Here we report a series of reconstructed interferometric images of the surface of the evolved giant star R Doradus. The images reveal a stellar disc with prominent small scale features that provide the structure and motions of convection on the stellar surface. We find that the dominant structure size of the features on the stellar disc is $0.72\pm0.05$ astronomical units (au). We measure the velocity of the surface motions to vary between $-18$ and $+20$ km s$^{-1}$, which means the convective timescale is approximately one month. This indicates a possible difference between the convection properties of low-mass and high-mass evolved stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Our solar system's path has recently been shown to potentially intersect dense interstellar clouds 2 and 7 million years ago: the Local Lynx of Cold Cloud and the edge of the Local Bubble. These clouds compressed the heliosphere, directly exposing Earth to the interstellar medium. Previous studies that examined climate effects of these encounters argued for an induced ice age due to the formation of global noctilucent clouds (NLCs). Here, we revisit such studies with a modern 2D atmospheric chemistry model using parameters of global heliospheric magnetohydrodynamic models as input. We show that NLCs remain confined to polar latitudes and short seasonal lifetimes during these dense cloud crossings lasting $\sim10^5$ years. Polar mesospheric ozone becomes significantly depleted, but the total ozone column broadly increases. Furthermore, we show that the densest NLCs lessen the amount of sunlight reaching the surface instantaneously by up to 7% while halving outgoing longwave radiation.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the serendipitous discovery of a bow-shock nebula around the cataclysmic variable (CV) SY Cancri. In addition, SY Cnc lies near the edge of a faint Halpha-emitting nebula with a diameter of about 15'. The orientation of the bow shock is consistent with the direction of SY Cnc's proper motion. Nebulae are extremely rare around CVs, apart from those known to have undergone classical-nova (CN) outbursts; bow shocks and off-center nebulae are even more unusual. Nevertheless, the properties of SY Cnc and its nebulosity are strikingly similar to those of V341 Ara, another CV that is also associated with a bow shock and is likewise off-center with respect to its faint Halpha nebula. Both stars are binaries with optically thick accretion disks, belonging to the classes of Z Cam CVs or nova-like variables. We discuss three scenarios to explain the properties of the nebulae. They may have resulted from chance encounters with interstellar gas clouds, with the stars leaving in their wakes material that is recombining after being photoionized by UV radiation from the CVs. Alternatively, the large nebulae could be ejecta from unobserved CN outbursts in the recent past, which have been decelerated through collisions with the interstellar medium (ISM), while the stars continue to snowplow through the gas. Or the faint Halpha nebulae may be ambient ISM that was shock-ionized by a CN outburst in the past and is now recombining.
#### The only inflated brown dwarf in an eclipsing white dwarf-brown dwarf binary: WD1032+011B

 - **Abstract**
 Due to their short orbital periods and relatively high flux ratios, irradiated brown dwarfs in binaries with white dwarfs offer better opportunities to study irradiated atmospheres than hot Jupiters, which have lower planet-to-star flux ratios. WD1032+011 is an eclipsing, tidally locked white dwarf-brown dwarf binary with a 9950 K white dwarf orbited by a 69.7 M$_{Jup}$ brown dwarf in a 0.09 day orbit. We present time-resolved Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 spectrophotometric data of WD1032+011. We isolate the phase-dependent spectra of WD1032+011B, finding a 210 K difference in brightness temperature between the dayside and nightside. The spectral type of the brown dwarf is identified as L1 peculiar, with atmospheric retrievals and comparison to field brown dwarfs showing evidence for a cloud-free atmosphere. The retrieved temperature of the dayside is $1748^{+66}_{-67}$ K, with a nightside temperature of $1555^{+76}_{-62}$ K, showing an irradiation-driven temperature contrast coupled with inefficient heat redistribution from the dayside to the nightside. The brown dwarf radius is inflated, likely due to the constant irradiation from the white dwarf, making it the only known inflated brown dwarf in an eclipsing white dwarf-brown dwarf binary.
#### Kink instability of flux ropes in partially-ionised plasmas

 - **Abstract**
 In the solar atmosphere, flux ropes are subject to current driven instabilities that are crucial in driving plasma eruptions, ejections and heating. A typical ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) instability developing in flux ropes is the helical kink, which twists the flux rope axis. The growth of this instability can trigger magnetic reconnection, which can explain the formation of chromospheric jets and spicules, but its development has never been investigated in a partially-ionised plasma (PIP). Here we study the kink instability in PIP to understand how it develops in the solar chromosphere, where it is affected by charge-neutral interactions. Partial ionisation speeds up the onset of the non-linear phase of the instability, as the plasma $\beta$ of the isolated plasma is smaller than the total plasma $\beta$ of the bulk. The distribution of the released magnetic energy changes in fully and partially-ionised plasmas, with a larger increase of internal energy associated to the PIP cases. The temperature in PIP increases faster also due to heating terms from the two-fluid dynamics. PIP effects trigger the kink instability on shorter time scales, which is reflected in a more explosive chromospheric flux rope dynamics. These results are crucial to understand the dynamics of small-scale chromospheric structures - mini-filament eruptions - that this far have been largely neglected but could significantly contribute to chromospheric heating and jet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The compact object with a mass of $2.50-2.67~M_\odot$ observed by LIGO Scientific and Virgo collaborations in GW190814, as well as the recent report of a light compact object with a mass and radius of $M=0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}M_{\odot}$ and $R=10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347, have posed a great challenge to the investigations into the supranuclear matter. In the inner core region of the neutron star, the strangeness degrees of freedom, such as the hyperons, can be present, which is also named as a hyperonic star. In this work, the neutron star consisting of nucleons and leptons, and the hyperonic star including the hyperons will be studied in the framework of the density-dependent relativistic mean-field (DDRMF) model. Some popular DDRMF parameterizations will be adopted to investigate the properties of nuclear matter and the mass, radius, tidal deformability, and other properties of neutron star and hyperonic stars. We find that the maximum masses of neutron star calculated by DD-MEX, DD-MEX1, DD-MEX2, DD-MEXY and DD-LZ1 sets can be around $2.5-2.6~M_\odot$ with quite stiff equations of state (EOSs) generated by their strong repulsive contributions from vector potentials at high densities. Moreover, by investigating the influence of the crust EOS and core EOS on the neutron stars, we find that the observational data from HESS J1731-347 suggest the requirement of a crust EOS with a higher $L$ parameter and a core EOS with a lower $L$ parameter, and the $M-R$ relations from the constructed EOSs can also be consistent with the observables of PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0030+0451 from NICER and the GW170817 event. With the inclusion of hyperons, the hyperonic star matter becomes softer compared to the neutron star matter. But the massive hyperonic star can also be obtained with DDRMF parameter sets if the vector coupling constants are strong.
#### Galactic Distribution of Supernovae and OB Associations

 - **Abstract**
 We update and extend a previous model by Higdon and Lingenfelter for the longitudinal profile of the N\,II intensity in the Galactic plane. The model is based on four logarithmic spiral arms, to which features like the Local Arm and local sources are added. Connecting then the N\,II to the H\,II emission, we use this model to determine the average spatial distribution of OBassociations in the Milky Way. Combined with a stellar mass and cluster distribution function, the model predicts the average spatial and temporal distribution of core-collapse supernovae in the Milky Way. In addition to this average population, we account for supernovae from observed OB associations, providing thereby a more accurate description of the nearby Galaxy. The complete model is made publicly available in the python code SNOB.
#### A new analytic approach to infer the cosmic-ray ionization rate in hot molecular cores from HCO$^+$, N$_2$H$^+$, and CO observations

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic-ray ionization rate ($\zeta_2$) is one of the key parameters in star formation, since it regulates the chemical and dynamical evolution of molecular clouds by ionizing molecules and determining the coupling between the magnetic field and gas. However, measurements of $\zeta_2$ in dense clouds (e.g., $n_{\rm H} \geq 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$) are difficult and sensitive to the model assumptions. The aim is to find a convenient analytic approach that can be used in high-mass star-forming regions (HMSFRs), especially for warm gas environments such as hot molecular cores (HMCs). We propose a new analytic approach to calculate $\zeta_2$ through HCO$^+$, N$_2$H$^+$, and CO measurements. Our method gives a good approximation, to within $50$\%, of $\zeta_2$ in dense and warm gas (e.g., $n_{\rm H} \geq 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$, $T = 50, 100$ K) for $A_{\rm V} \geq 4$ mag and $t \geq 2\times10^4$ yr at Solar metallicity. The analytic approach gives better results for higher densities. However, it starts to underestimate the CRIR at low metallicity ($Z = 0.1Z_\odot$) and high CRIR ($\zeta_2 \geq 3\times10^{-15}$ s$^{-1}$). By applying our method to the OMC-2 FIR4 envelope and the L1157-B1 shock region, we find $\zeta_2$ values of $(1.0\pm0.3)\times10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$ and $(2.2\pm0.4)\times10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$, consistent with those previously reported. We calculate $\zeta_2$ toward a total of 82 samples in HMSFRs, finding that the average value of $\zeta_2$ toward all HMC samples ($\zeta_2$ = (7.4$\pm$5.0)$\times$10$^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$) is more than an order of magnitude higher than the theoretical prediction of cosmic-ray attenuation models, favoring the scenario that locally accelerated cosmic rays in embedded protostars should be responsible for the observed high $\zeta_2$.

 - **Abstract**
 Computational chemistry plays a relevant role in many astrochemical research fields, either by complementing experimental measurements or by deriving parameters difficult to be reproduced by laboratories. While the role of computational spectroscopy in assisting new observations in space is described, the core of the chapter is the investigation of the collisional radiative transfer and the bimolecular reactive processes occurring in the gas-phase conditions of the interstellar medium, using as a guide the contributions presented by the authors at the "Second Italian National Congress on Proto(-planetary) Astrochemistry", held in Trieste in September 2023. In particular, the need for accurate datasets of collisional coefficients to model molecular abundances will be discussed. Then, the role of quantum chemistry in the investigation of interstellar-relevant potential energy surfaces will be described, focusing on accurate thermodynamic quantities for the estimate of rate coefficients.
#### CHEMOUT: CHEMical complexity in star-forming regions of the OUTer Galaxy. IV. ALMA observations of organic species at Galactocentric radius ~23 kpc

 - **Abstract**
 Single-dish observations suggest that the abundances of organic species in star-forming regions of the outer Galaxy, characterised by sub-Solar metallicities, are comparable to those found in the local Galaxy. To understand this counter-intuitive result, and avoid misleading interpretation due to beam dilution effects at such large distances, spatially resolved molecular emission maps are needed to link correctly measured abundances and local physical properties. We observed several organic molecules with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array towards WB89-671, the source with the largest Galactocentric distance (23.4~kpc) of the project "CHEMical complexity in star-forming regions of the OUTer Galaxy" (CHEMOUT), at a resolution of 15000~au. We compared the observed molecular abundances with chemical model predictions. We detected emission of c-C3H2, C4H, CH3OH, H2CO, HCO, H13CO+, HCS+, CS, HN13C, and SO. The emission morphology is complex, extended, and different in each tracer. The most intense emission in H13CO+, H2CO and c-C3H2 arises from two millimeter continuum, infrared-bright cores. The most intense CH3OH and SO emission arises predominantly from the part of the filament with no continuum sources. The narrow linewidths across the filament indicate quiescent gas, despite the two embedded protostars. Derived molecular column densities are comparable with those in local star-forming regions, and suggest anti-correlation between hydrocarbons, ions, HCO, and H2CO on one side, and CH3OH and SO on the other. Static chemical models that best match the observed column densities favour low energetic conditions, expected at large Galactocentric radii, but carbon elemental abundances 3 times higher than that derived extrapolating the [C/H] Galactocentric gradient at 23~kpc. This would indicate a flatter [C/H] trend at large Galactocentric radii, in line with a flat abundance of organics.

 - **Abstract**
 Telescope missions are currently being designed which will make direct imaging of habitable exoplanets possible in the near future, and studies are needed to quantify the detectability of biosignature features in the planet's reflectance spectrum. We simulated the detectability of a NIR-absorbing surface biosignature feature with simulated observations of the nearby exoplanet Proxima Centauri b. We modeled a biosignature spectral feature with a reflectance spectrum based on an anoxygenic photosynthetic bacterial species that has strong absorption at 1 um, which could make it well suited for life on an M-dwarf hosted planet. We modeled the distribution of this organism across the planet's surface based on climate states from a 3D General Circulation Model (GCM), which were Archean and Proterozoic-like exo-Earth analogues. We included the GCM runs' prognostically simulated water clouds and added organic haze into the Archean-like atmospheres. We simulated observations of these Proxima Centauri b scenarios with the LUVOIR-A and B telescope concepts, with LUVOIR-B serving as a proxy to the planned Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). We calculated integration times necessary to detect the biosignature, and found that it would be detectable on Proxima Centauri b if the organism is moderately abundant (greater than a 1-4% global surface area coverage), as long as the atmosphere is transmitting in the wavelength range under consideration. Small amounts of methane, clouds, and haze do not greatly impede detectability. We found preliminary evidence that such a biosignature would be detectable on exoplanets within 15 pc, but further investigations are needed to corroborate this.
#### Size distribution of small grains in the inner zodiacal cloud

 - **Abstract**
 The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft has transited the inner-most regions of the zodiacal cloud and detects impacts to the spacecraft body via its electric field instrument. Multiple dust populations have been proposed to explain the PSP dust impact rates. PSP's unique orbit allows us to identify a region where the impact rates are likely dominated by $\alpha$-meteoroids, small zodiacal grains on approximately circular, bound orbits. From the distribution of voltage signals generated by dust impacts to PSP in this region, we find the cumulative mass index for grains with radii of $\sim$0.6-1.4 $\mu$m (masses of $3\times10^{-15}$ to $3\times10^{-14}$ kg) to be $\alpha = 1.1 \pm 0.3$ from 0.1-0.25 $R_\odot$. $\alpha$ increases toward the Sun, with even smaller fragments generated closer to the Sun. The derived size distribution is steeper than previously estimated, and in contrast to expectations we find most of the dust mass resides in the smallest fragments and not in large grains inside 0.15 au. As the inner-most regions of the zodiacal cloud are likely collisionally evolved, these results place new constraints how the solar system's zodiacal cloud and by extension astrophysical debris disks are partitioned in mass.
