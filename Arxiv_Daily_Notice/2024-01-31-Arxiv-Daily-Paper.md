 - **Abstract**
 Classical gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have two distinct emission episodes: prompt emission from ultra-relativistic ejecta and afterglow from shocked circumstellar material. While both components are extremely luminous in known GRBs, a variety of scenarios predict the existence of luminous afterglow emission with little or no associated high-energy prompt emission. We present AT 2019pim, the first secure example of this phenomenon to be identified. Serendipitously discovered during follow-up observations of a gravitational-wave trigger and located in a contemporaneous TESS sector, it is hallmarked by a fast-rising (t ~ 2 hr), luminous (M_UV,peak ~ -24.4 mag) optical transient with accompanying luminous X-ray and radio emission. No gamma-ray emission consistent with the time and location of the transient was detected by Fermi-GBM or by Konus, placing strong limits on an accompanying GRB. We investigate several independent observational aspects of the afterglow in the context of constraints on relativistic motion and find all of them are consistent with an initial Lorentz factor of Gamma_0 ~ 30-50, significantly lower than in any well-observed GRB and consistent with the theoretically-predicted "dirty fireball" scenario in which the high-energy prompt emission is stifled by pair production. However, we cannot rule out a structured jet model in which only the line-of-sight material was ejected at low-Gamma, off-axis from a classical high-Gamma jet core. This event represents a milestone in orphan afterglow searches, demonstrating that luminous afterglows with weak or no detectable gamma-ray radiation exist in nature and can be discovered by high-cadence optical surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new observations of the central 1 kpc of the M 82 starburst obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) near-infrared camera (NIRCam) instrument at a resolution ~0.05"-0.1" (~1-2 pc). The data comprises images in three mostly continuum filters (F140M, F250M, and F360M), and filters that contain [FeII] (F164N), H2 v=1-0 (F212N), and the 3.3 um PAH feature (F335M). We find prominent plumes of PAH emission extending outward from the central starburst region, together with a network of complex filamentary substructure and edge-brightened bubble-like features. The structure of the PAH emission closely resembles that of the ionized gas, as revealed in Paschen alpha and free-free radio emission. We discuss the origin of the structure, and suggest the PAHs are embedded in a combination of neutral, molecular, and photoionized gas.

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) as a standard candle is an ideal tool to measure cosmic distance and expansion history of the Universe. Here we investigate the SN Ia photometric measurement in the China Space Station Telescope Ultra Deep Field (CSST-UDF) survey, and study the constraint power on the cosmological parameters, such as the equation of state of dark energy. The CSST-UDF survey is expected to cover a 9 deg$^2$ sky area in two years with 60 exposures. The magnitude limit can reach $i\simeq26$ AB mag for 5$\sigma$ point source detection. We generate light curve mock data for SNe Ia and different types of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), based on the relevant SN SED templates, natural generation rates, luminosity functions, CSST instrumental design and survey strategy. After selecting high-quality data and fitting the light curves, we derive the light curve parameters and identify CCSNe as contamination, resulting in $\sim2200$ SNe with a $\sim7\%$ CCSN contamination rate. We adopt a calibration method similar to Chauvenet's criterion, and apply it to the distance modulus data to further reduce the contamination. We find that this method is effective and can suppress the contamination fraction to $\sim3.5\%$ with 2012 SNe Ia and 73 CCSNe. About 16\% of SNe Ia are at $z>1$ in the final CSST-UDF SN sample. By checking the cosmological constraints, the result derived from this calibrated SN sample is in good agreement with that using the pure SN Ia sample. The constraint accuracies on $\Omega_{\rm M}$, $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ and $w$ are about $10\%\sim20\%$, which is about two times better than the current SN surveys, and it could be further improved by a factor of $\sim$1.4 if including the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the CSST spectroscopic survey. This indicates that CSST can provide accurate measurements for the cosmic expansion history and the nature of dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 The eruption of solar filaments, also known as prominences appearing off-limb, is a common phenomenon in the solar atmosphere. It ejects massive plasma and high-energy particles into interplanetary space, disturbing the solar-terrestrial environment. It is vital to obtain the three-dimensional velocity fields of erupting filaments for space-weather predictions. We derive the three-dimensional kinematics of an off-limb prominence and an on-disk filament, respectively, using the full-disk spectral and imaging data detected by the Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar Explorer (CHASE). It is found that both the prominence and the filament experience a fast semicircle-shaped expansion at first. The prominence keeps propagating outward with an increasing velocity until escaping successfully, whereas the south leg of the prominence finally moves back to the Sun in a swirling manner. For the filament, the internal plasma falls back to the Sun associated with an anticlockwise rotation in the late ejection, matching the failed eruption without a coronal mass ejection. During the eruptions, both the prominence and the filament show material splitting along the line-of-sight direction, revealed by the bimodal H$\alpha$ spectral profiles. For the prominence, the splitting begins at the top and gradually spreads to almost the whole prominence with a fast blue-shift component and a slow red-shift component. The material splitting in the filament is more fragmental. As shown by the present results, the CHASE full-disk spectroscopic observations make it possible to systematically study the three-dimensional kinematics of solar filament eruptions.

 - **Abstract**
 Population III (pop III) stars were born in halos characterised by a pristine gas composition. In such a halo, once the gas density reaches n$_{\mathrm{H}} \sim$ 1 cm$^{-3}$, molecular cooling leads to the collapse of the gas and the birth of pop III stars. Halo properties, such as the chemical abundances, mass, and angular momentum can affect the collapse of the gas, thereby leading to the pop III initial mass function (IMF) of star formation. We want to study the properties of primordial halos and how halos that host early star formation differ from other types of halos. The aim of this study is to obtain a representative population of halos at a given redshift hosting a cold and massive gas cloud that enables the birth of the first stars. We investigated the growth of primordial halos in a $\Lambda$CDM Universe in a large cosmological simulation. We used the hydrodynamic code RAMSES and the chemical solver KROME to study halo formation with non-equilibrium thermochemistry. We then identified structures in the dark and baryonic matter fields, thereby linking the presence or absence of dense gas clouds to the mass and the physical properties of the hosting halos. In our simulations, the mass threshold for a halo for hosting a cold dense gas cloud is $\simeq 7 \times 10^5 M_{\odot}$ and the threshold in the H$_2$ mass fraction is found to be $\simeq 2 \times 10^{-4}$. This is in agreement with previous works. We find that the halo history and accretion rate play a minor role. Here, we present halos with higher HD abundances, which are shown to be colder, as the temperature in the range between $10^2 - 10^4 \, \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ depends on the HD abundance to a large extent. The higher fraction of HD is linked to the higher spin parameter that is seen for the dense gas.

 - **Abstract**
 Polar vortices are common in the atmospheres of rapidly rotating planets [1-4]. On Earth and Mars they are tied to the surface and their existence follows the seasonal insolation cycle [1-3]. Venus is a slowly rotating planet but it is also known to have vortices at both poles at the edge of a superrotating atmosphere [5-8]. However, their nature and long-term properties have not been constrained so far impeding precise modeling. Here we report cloud motions at two altitude levels (about 42 km and 63 km above the surface) using infrared images from the VIRTIS instrument onboard Venus Express that show that the south polar vortex is a permanent but erratic and unpredictable feature. We find that the centers of rotation of the vortex at these levels rarely coincide and both wander erratically around the pole with speeds of up to 16 m s-1. The cloud morphology and vorticity patches are uncorrelated and change continuously developing transient areas of small vertical motions. Venus south polar vortex is a continuously evolving structure immersed in a baroclinic environment laying at altitude levels that have variable vertical and meridional wind shears, extending at least 20 km in height through a quasi-convective turbulent region.

 - **Abstract**
 Intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs, $\sim 10^2-10^5M_{\odot}$) are often dubbed as the missing link between stellar mass ($\lesssim 10^2M_{\odot}$) and super-massive ($\gtrsim 10^{5-6} M_{\odot}$) black holes. Observational signatures of these can result from tidal disruption of white dwarfs (WDs), which would otherwise be captured as a whole by super-massive black holes. Recent observations indicate that IMBHs might be rapidly spinning, while it is also known that isolated white dwarfs might have large spins, with spin periods of the order of minutes. Here, we aim to understand the effects of ``coupling'' between black hole and stellar spin, focussing on the tidal disruption of spinning WDs in the background of spinning IMBHs. Using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, we perform a suite of numerical simulations of partial tidal disruptions, where spinning WDs are in eccentric orbits about spinning IMBHs. We take a hybrid approach, where we integrate the Kerr geodesic equations while being in a regime where we can treat the internal stellar fluid dynamics in the Newtonian limit. We find substantial effects of the ``coupling'' between the black hole spin and the spin of the white dwarf, although the pericenter distance of the white dwarf is taken to be large enough so that the Newtonian limit of its fluid dynamics is a robust approximation. In particular, the core mass, the bound tail mass, and the mass difference between the two tidal tails strongly depend on such ``coupled'' spin effects. However, the late time fallback rate of the debris behaves similar to the non-spinning cases. We also compute gravitational wave amplitudes and find that while the black hole spin influences the same, there is no evidence of influence of stellar spin on such amplitudes in our regime of interest.
#### Six years of Venus winds at the upper cloud level from UV, visible and  near infrared observations from VIRTIS on Venus Express

 - **Abstract**
 Venus Express provided a long-term monitoring of Venus atmosphere. Several works focused on the dynamics of the upper cloud visible on the day-side in ultraviolet images sensitive to the 65-70 km altitude and in the lower cloud level (50 km height) observable in the night-side of the planet in 1.74 microns. Here we use VIRTIS-M spectral images to study the upper cloud layer in ultraviolet (360-400 nm), visible (570-680 nm) and near infrared (900-955 nm) extending in time previous analysis of VIRTIS-M data. UV images show relatively well contrasted cloud features at the cloud top. Cloud features in the visible and near infrared images lie a few kilometers below the upper cloud top, have low contrast and are distinct to the features observed in the uv. Wind measurements were obtained over a six-year period using a semi-automatic cloud correlation algorithm. Results for the upper cloud confirm analysis based on images obtained by the Venus Monitoring Camera (Khatuntsev et al. 2013). At the cloud top the mean zonal and meridional winds vary with local time accelerating towards the local afternoon. The upper branch of the Hadley cell reaches maximum velocities at 45deg latitude and local times of 14-16h. The mean zonal winds in the uv cloud accelerated in the course of the 2006-2012 period 15 ms-1. The near infrared and visible images show a more constant circulation without time variability or longitudinal variations. The meridional circulation is absent in near infrared and visible images indicating thatthe Hadley-cell circulation in Venus atmosphere is shallow or the returning branch of the meridional circulation extends to levels below levels sensed in near infrared images. At the clod tops observed in UV images there are signatures of a long-term acceleration of the zonal winds when comparing winds from 2006-2008 to 2009-2012 with a mean acceleration of 17 ms-1 between both time periods

 - **Abstract**
 We have analyzed the total intensity, spectral index, linear polarization, and RM distributions at pc scale for the quasar 1604+159. The source was observed in 2002 and 2020 with the VLBA. Combining the MOJAVE results, we studied the evolution of the magnetic field. We detected a core-jet structure. The jet extends to a distance of ~25 mas. The jet shape varies slightly with time. We divided the source structure into the central region and the jet region. In the jet region, we find the polarized emission varies with time. The flatter spectral index values and EVPA direction indicate the possible existence of shocks, contributing to the variation. In the central region, the derived core shift index k_r values indicate that the core in 2002 is close to the equipartition case while deviating from it in 2020. The measured magnetic field strength in 2020 is two orders of magnitude lower than that in 2002. We detected transverse RM gradients, evidence of a helical magnetic field, in the core. At 15 GHz, in the place close to the jet base, the polarization direction changes significantly with time from perpendicular to parallel to the jet direction. The evolution of RM and magnetic field structure are potential reasons for the observed polarization change. The core |RM| in 2020 increases with frequency following a power law with index a = 2.7, suggesting a fast electron density fall-off in the medium with distance from the jet base.
#### Collapsing massive stars and their EM transients

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the fate of a collapsing stellar core, which is the final state of evolution of a massive, rotating star of a Wolf-Rayet type. Such stars explode as type I b/c supernovae, which have been observed in association with long gamma ray bursts (GRBs). The core of the star is potentially forming a black hole, which is embedded in a dense, rotating, and possibly highly magnetized envelope. We study the process of collapse using General Relativistic MHD simulations, and we account for the growth of the black hole mass and its spin, as well as related evolution of the spacetime metric. We find that some particular configurations of the initial black hole spin, the content of angular momentum in the stellar core, and the magnetic field configuration and its strength, are favored for producing a bright electromagnetic transient (i.e., a gamma ray burst). On the other hand, most of the typical configurations studied in our models do not lead to a transient electromagnetic explosion and will end up in a direct collapse, accompanied by some residual variability induced by changing accretion rate. We also study the role of self-gravity in the stellar core and quantify the relative strength of the interfacial instabilities, such as Self-Gravity Interfacial (SGI) instability and Rayleigh-Taylor (RT), which may account for the production of an inhomogeneous structure, including spikes and bubbles, through the inner radii of the collapsing core (inside $\sim 200~r_{g}$). %Furthermore, we investigate the axisymmetric modes of gravitational instability based on the generalized Toomre parameter. We find that in self-gravitating collapsars the RT modes cannot grow efficiently. We also conclude that transonic shocks are formed in the collapsing envelope, but they are weaker in magnetized stars.
#### Massive clumps in W43-main: Structure formation in an extensively  shocked molecular cloud

 - **Abstract**
 W43-main is a massive molecular complex located at the interaction of the Scutum arm and the Galactic bar undergoing starburst activities. We aim to investigate the gas dynamics, in particular, the prevailing shock signatures from the cloud to clump scale and assess the impact of shocks on the formation of dense gas and early-stage cores. We have carried out NOEMA and IRAM-30m observations at 3 mm with an angular resolution of $\sim$0.1 pc towards five massive clumps in W43 main. We use CH$_{3}$CCH and H$_{2}$CS lines to trace the extended gas temperature and CH$_{3}$OH lines to probe the volume density of the dense gas ($\gtrsim$10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$). The emission of SiO (2-1) is extensive across the region ($\sim$4 pc) and is mostly contained within a low-velocity regime, hinting at a large-scale origin of the shocks. The position-velocity maps of multiple tracers show systematic spatio-kinematic offsets supporting the cloud-cloud collision/merging scenario. We identify an additional extended velocity component in CCH emission, which coincides with one of the velocity components of the larger scale $^{13}$CO (2-1) emission, likely representing an outer, less dense gas layer in the cloud merging process. We find that the V-shaped, asymmetric SiO wings are tightly correlated with localised gas density enhancements, which is direct evidence of dense gas formation and accumulation in shocks. We resolve two categories of NH$_{2}$D cores: ones exhibiting only subsonic to transonic velocity dispersion, and the others with an additional supersonic velocity dispersion. The centroid velocities of the latter cores are correlated with the shock front seen by SiO. The kinematics of the $\sim$0.1 pc NH$_{2}$D cores are heavily imprinted by shock activities, and may represent a population of early-stage cores forming around the shock interface.
#### Study of X-ray emission from the S147 nebula by SRG/eROSITA:  supernova-in-the-cavity scenario

 - **Abstract**
 The Simeis~147 nebula (S147), particularly well known for a spectacular net of ${\rm H}_\alpha$-emitting filaments, is often considered one of the largest and oldest known supernova remnants in the Milky Way. Here, and in a companion paper, we present studies of X-ray emission from the S147 nebula using the data of SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey observations. In this paper, we argue that many inferred properties of the X-ray emitting gas are broadly consistent with a scenario of the supernova explosion in a low-density cavity, e.g. a wind-blown-bubble. This scenario assumes that a $\sim 20\,{\rm M_\odot}$ progenitor star has had small velocity with respect to the ambient ISM, so it stayed close to the center of a dense shell created during its Main Sequence evolution till the moment of the core-collapse explosion. The ejecta first propagate through the low-density cavity until they collide with the dense shell, and only then the reverse shock goes deeper into the ejecta and powers the observed X-ray emission of the nebula. The part of the remnant inside the dense shell remains non-radiative till now and, plausibly, in a state with $T_e<T_i$ and Non-Equilibrium Ionization (NEI). On the contrary, the forward shock becomes radiative immediately after entering the dense shell, and, being subject to instabilities, creates a characteristic "foamy" appearance of the nebula in ${\rm H}_\alpha$ and radio emission.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed study of the hydrogen density distribution in the local interstellar medium (ISM) using the X-ray absorption technique. Hydrogen column densities were precisely measured by fitting X-ray spectra from coronal sources observed during the initial {\it eROSITA} all-sky survey (eRASS1). Accurate distance measurements were obtained through cross-matching Galactic sources with the {\it Gaia} third data release (DR3). Despite the absence of a discernible correlation between column densities and distances or Galactic longitude, a robust correlation with Galactic latitude was identified. This suggests a decrease in ISM material density along the vertical direction away from the Galactic plane. To further investigate, we employed multiple density laws to fit the measured column densities, revealing constraints on height scale values ($8 < h_{z} < 30$~pc). Unfortunately, radial scales and central density remain unconstrained due to the scarcity of sources near the Galactic center. Subsequently, a 3D density map of the ISM was computed using a Gaussian processing approach, inferring hydrogen density distribution from hydrogen column densities. The results unveiled the presence of multiple beams and clouds of various sizes, indicative of small-scale structures. Large density regions were identified at approximately 100~pc, consistent with findings in dust reddening studies, potentially associated with the Galactic Perseus arm. Moreover, high-density regions were pinpointed in proximity to the Orion star-forming region and the Chamaeleon molecular complex, enriching our understanding of the intricate structure of the local interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 We study variability through simultaneous optical and X-ray observations for the first time in a statistical sample of 256 M dwarfs. Such observations are required to constrain the flare frequency and energetics and to understand the physics of flares. Using light curves from extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board the Russian Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma mission (SRG) and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we identify 256 M dwarfs with simultaneous detections. The 25 brightest or most variable in X-rays are selected. Stellar parameters are obtained from Gaia and 2MASS, while X-ray fluxes are derived from eROSITA count rates. Proximity (<100 pc), fast rotation (P_rot < 9 d), and high flare frequency characterize our sample. Optical and X-ray duty cycles correlate positively, with faster rotators exhibiting more variability. Stars with frequent X-ray flares often coincide with optical flares. Analyzing individual X-ray flares is hindered by eROSITA's low cadence, mitigated by leveraging TESS optical flares and solar flare knowledge. An exponential fit to 21 X-ray light curves post-optical flares reveals a correlation between X-ray and optical flare energies. Despite uncertainties due to poor eROSITA sampling, our study underscores the significance of simultaneous all-sky surveys in diverse wavelengths for unprecedented insights into stellar variability.

 - **Abstract**
 A dozen of patches of polarized radio emission spanning tens of degrees in the form of coherent and stationary loops are observed at radio frequencies across the sky. Their origin is usually associated to nearby shocks, possibly arising from close supernovae explosions. The origin of the radio Loop XII remains so far unknown. We report an anti-correlation of the radio polarized emission of loop XII with a large patch of soft X-ray emission found with SRG/eROSITA in excess of the background surface brightness, in the same region. The soft X-ray seemingly coherent patch in excess of the background emission, which we dub as the Goat Horn complex, extends over a remarkable area of $\sim 1000$ deg$^2$ and includes an arc-shaped enhancement potentially tracing a cold front. An anti-correlation of the X-ray intensity with the temperature of the plasma responsible for the X-ray emission is also observed. The X-ray bright arc seems to anticipate the radio loop XII by some degrees on the sky. This behavior can be recast in terms of a correlation between X-ray surface brightness and radio depolarization. We explore and discuss different possible scenarios for the source of the diffuse emission in the Goat Horn complex: a large supernova remnant; an outflow from active star formation regions in nearby Galactic spiral arms; a hot atmosphere around the Large Magellanic Cloud. In order to probe these scenarios further, a more detailed characterization on the velocity of the hot gas is required.

 Context. During four all-sky surveys (eRASS1--4), eROSITA, the soft X-ray instrument aboard Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) detected a new supersoft X-ray source, eRASSU J060839.5-704014, in the direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Methods. We arranged follow-up observations in the X-ray and optical wavelengths and further searched in archival observations to reveal the nature of the object. Results. We discover pulsations at ~374 s with a pulse profile consistent with 100% modulation. We identify two other periodicities in the eROSITA data, which we establish as aliases due to the sampling of the eROSITA light curve. We identify a multi-wavelength counterpart to the X-ray source in UVW1 and g, r, i, and z images obtained by the optical/UV monitor on XMM-Newton and the Dark Energy Camera at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. The timing and spectral characteristics of the source are consistent with a double degenerate ultra-compact binary system in the foreground of the LMC. eRASSU J060839.5-704014 belongs to a rare class of AM CVns, which are important to study in the context of progenitors of SN Ia and for persistent gravitational wave detection. Conclusions. We identify eRASSU J060839.5-704014 as a new double degenerate ultra-compact binary located in the foreground of the LMC.

 Context. Cataclysmic variables with degenerate donors which have evolved past the period minimum, also known as period-bouncers, are predicted to make up a great portion of the cataclysmic variable population, between 40 and 70 percent. However, either due to shortcomings in the models or due to the intrinsic faintness of these strongly evolved systems, only a few have been confidently identified so far. Aims. We have compiled a multi-wavelength catalog of period-bouncers and cataclysmic variables around the period minimum from the literature in order to provide an in-depth characterization of the elusive subclass of period-bounce CVs that will help in the identification of new candidates. Methods. In this study we combine published or archival multi-wavelength data with new X-ray observations from the all-sky surveys carried out with the extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) onboard the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma spacecraft (SRG). Our catalog comprises 192 cataclysmic variables around the period minimum that were chosen as likely period bounce candidates based on reported short orbital periods and low donor mass. This sample helped us establish specific selection parameters that have been used to compile a scorecard which rates a systems likelihood of being a period-bouncer. Results. Our scorecard correctly assigns high scores to the already confirmed period-bouncers in our literature catalog and it identifies 80 additional strong period-bounce candidates present in the literature that have not been classified as such. We established two selection cuts based on the X-ray-to-optical flux ratio and the typical X-ray luminosity observed from the 8 already confirmed period-bouncers with eROSITA data. These X-ray selection cuts led to the categorization of 5 systems as new period-bouncers, increasing their population number to 22 systems.

 The study of the entire population of SNRs in a galaxy helps us to understand the underlying stellar populations, the environments, in which the SNRs are evolving, and the stellar feedback on the ISM. The all-sky survey carried out by the extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (Spektr-RG, SRG) has provided us with spatially and spectrally resolved X-ray data of the entire Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and its immediate surroundings in the soft X-ray band down to 0.2 keV. We performed a multiwavelength analysis of previously known SNR candidates and newly detected SNRs and SNR candidates. We applied the Gaussian gradient magnitude (GGM) filter to the eROSITA images of the LMC to highlight the edges of the shocked gas in order to find new SNRs. We compared the X-ray images with those of their optical and radio counterparts to investigate the true nature of the extended emission. We used the Magellanic Cloud Emission Line Survey (MCELS) for the optical data. For the radio comparison, we used data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) survey of the LMC. Using the VISTA survey of the Magellanic Clouds (VMC) we have investigated the possible progenitors of the new SNRs and SNR candidates in our sample. We present the most updated catalogue of SNRs in the LMC. The eROSITA data have allowed us to confirm two of the previous SNR candidates and discover 16 new extended sources. We confirm 3 of them as new SNRs, while we propose the remaining 13 as new X-ray SNR candidates. We also present the first analysis of the follow-up XMM-Newton observation of MCSNR J0456-6533 discovered with eROSITA. Among the new candidates, we propose J0614-7251 (4eRASSU J061438.1-725112) as the first X-ray SNR candidate in the outskirts of the LMC.

 - **Abstract**
 A thorough inspection of known Galactic Supernova Remnants (SNRs) along the Galactic plane with SRG/eROSITA yielded the detection of the X-ray counterpart of the SNR G279.0+01.1. The SNR is located just 1.5 deg above the Galactic plane. Its X-ray emission emerges as an incomplete, partial shell of $\sim$3 deg angular extension. It is strongly correlated to the fragmented shell-type morphology of its radio continuum emission. The X-ray spatial morphology of the SNR seems to be linked to the presence of dust clouds in the surroundings. The majority of its X-ray emission is soft (exhibiting strong O, Ne and Mg lines), and occurs in a narrow range of energies between 0.3 and 1.5 keV. Above 2.0 keV the remnant remains undetected. The remnant's X-ray spectrum is of purely thermal nature. Constraining the X-ray absorption column to values which are consistent with optical extinction data from the remnant's location favours non-equilibrium over equilibrium models. A non-equilibrium two-temperature plasma model of $\mathrm{kT}\sim0.3$~keV and $\mathrm{kT}\sim0.6$~keV, and an absorption column density of $\mathrm{N_{H}}\sim0.3~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ describes the spectrum of the entire remnant well. Significant temperature variations across the remnant have been detected. Employing 14.5 years of Fermi-LAT data, we carried out a comprehensive study of the extended GeV source 4FGL J1000.0-5312e. By refining and properly modeling the GeV excess originating from the location of the remnant, we conclude that the emission is likely related to the remnant itself rather than being co-located by chance. We also discuss implications of the new X-ray data to the estimates of the distance and age of the remnant.
