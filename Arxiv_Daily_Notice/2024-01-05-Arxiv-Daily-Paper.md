#### Chaos in Inhomogeneous Neutrino Fast Flavor Instability

 - **Abstract**
 In dense neutrino gases, the neutrino-neutrino coherent forward scattering gives rise to a complex flavor oscillation phenomenon not fully incorporated in simulations of neutron star mergers (NSM) and core collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Moreover, it has been proposed to be chaotic, potentially limiting our ability to predict neutrino flavor transformations in simulations. To address this issue, we explore how small flavor perturbations evolve within a narrow centimeter-scale region inside a NSM and a toy neutrino distribution. Our findings reveal that paths in the flavor state space of solutions with similar initial conditions diverge exponentially, exhibiting chaos. This inherent chaos makes the microscopic scales of neutrino flavor transformations unpredictable. However, the domain-averaged neutrino density matrix remains relatively stable, with chaos minimally affecting it. This particular property suggests that domain-averaged quantities remain reliable despite the exponential amplification of errors.

 - **Abstract**
 The AO327 drift survey for radio pulsars and transients used the Arecibo telescope from 2010 until its collapse in 2020. AO327 collected ~3100 hours of data at 327 MHz with a time resolution of 82 us and frequency resolution of 24 kHz. While the main motivation for such surveys is the discovery of new pulsars and new, even unforeseen, types of radio transients, they also serendipitously collect a wealth of data on known pulsars. We present an electronic catalog of data and data products on 206 pulsars whose periodic emission was detected by AO327 and are listed in the ATNF catalog of all published pulsars. The AO327 data products include dedispersed time series at full time resolution, average ("folded") pulse profiles, Gaussian pulse profile templates, and an absolute phase reference that allows phase-aligning the AO327 pulse profiles in a physically meaningful manner with profiles from data taken with other instruments. We also provide machine-readable tables with uncalibrated flux measurements at 327 MHz and pulse widths at 50% and 10% of the pulse peak determined from the fitted Gaussian profile templates. The AO327 catalog data set can be used in applications like population analysis of radio pulsars, pulse profile evolution studies in time and frequency, cone and core emission of the pulsar beam, scintillation, pulse intensity distributions, and others. It also constitutes a ready-made resource for teaching signal processing and pulsar astronomy techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 As a potential candidate for the late-time accelerating expansion of the Universe, the Chaplygin gas and its generalized models have significant implications to modern cosmology. In this work we investigate the effects of dark energy on the internal structure of a neutron star composed of two phases, which leads us to wonder: Do stable neutron stars have a dark-energy core? To address this question, we focus on the radial stability of stellar configurations composed by a dark-energy core -- described by a Chaplygin-type equation of state (EoS) -- and an ordinary-matter external layer which is described by a polytropic EoS. We examine the impact of the rate of energy densities at the phase-splitting surface, defined as $\alpha= \rho_{\rm dis}^-/\rho_{\rm dis}^+$, on the radius, total gravitational mass and oscillation spectrum. The resulting mass-radius diagrams are notably different from dark energy stars without a common-matter crust. Specifically, it is found that both the mass and the radius of the maximum-mass configuration decrease as $\alpha$ becomes smaller. Furthermore, our theoretical predictions for mass-radius relations consistently describe the observational measurements of different massive millisecond pulsars as well as the central compact object within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347. The analysis of the normal oscillation modes reveals that there are two regions of instability on the $M(\rho_c)$ curve when $\alpha$ is small enough indicating that the usual stability criterion $dM/d\rho_c>0$ still holds for rapid phase transitions. However, this is no longer true for the case of slow transitions.

 - **Abstract**
 The US National Gemini Office (US NGO), part of the Community Science and Data Center (CSDC) at NSF's NOIRLab, has completed a project to upgrade the IRAF-based Gemini reduction software to provide a fully supported system capable of running natively on modern hardware. This work includes 64-bit platform ports of the GEMINI package and dependency tasks (e.g. from the STSDAS external package), upgrades to the core IRAF system and all other external packages to fix any platform and licensing problems, and the establishment of fully supported Help Desk and distribution systems for the user community. Early results show a 10-20X speedup of execution times using the native 64-bit software compared to the virtualized 32-bit solutions now in use. Results are even better on new Apple M1/M2 platforms where the additional overhead of Intel CPU emulation can be eliminated. Timing comparisons, science verification testing, and release plans are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 We present our sixth set of results from our mid-infrared imaging survey of Milky Way Giant HII regions with our detailed analysis of NGC 3603, the most luminous GHII region in the Galaxy. We used imaging data from the FORCAST instrument on the Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) at 20 and 37 microns which mapped the central ~8.5'x8.5' infrared-emitting area of NGC 3603 at a spatial resolution of <~3". Utilizing these SOFIA data in conjunction with multi-wavelength observations from the near-infrared to radio, including Spitzer-IRAC and Herschel-PACS archival data, we investigate the physical nature of individual infrared sources and sub-components within NGC 3603. For individual compact sources we used the multi-wavelength photometry data to construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and fit them with massive young stellar object (MYSO) SED models, and find 14 sources that are likely to be MYSOs. We also detect dust emission from the 3 massive proplyd candidates, as well as from the disk and outflow of the evolved blue supergiant, Sher 25. Utilizing multi-wavelength data, we derived luminosity-to-mass ratio and virial parameters for the star-forming clumps within NGC 3603, estimating their relative ages and finding that NGC 3603 is an older GHII region overall, compared to our previously studied GHII regions. We discuss how NGC 3603, which we categorize as a 'cavity-type' GHII region, exhibits a more modest number of MYSOs and molecular clumps when compared to the 'distributed-type' GHII regions that share similar Lyman continuum photon rates.

 - **Abstract**
 In this research, we investigate the structural evolution of the cosmic web, employing advanced methodologies from Topological Data Analysis. Our approach involves leveraging $Persistence$ $Signals$, an innovative method from recent literature that facilitates the embedding of persistence diagrams into vector spaces by re-conceptualizing them as signals in $\mathbb R^2_+$. Utilizing this methodology, we analyze three quintessential cosmic structures: clusters, filaments, and voids. A central discovery is the correlation between $Persistence$ $Energy$ and redshift values, linking persistent homology with cosmic evolution and providing insights into the dynamics of cosmic structures.

 - **Abstract**
 Utilizing astrometric parameters sourced from \textit{Gaia} Data Release 3 and radial velocities obtained from various spectroscopic surveys, we identify 519 high-velocity stars (HiVels) with a total velocity in the Galactocentric restframe greater than 70\% of their local escape velocity under the {\tt\string Gala} {\tt\string MilkyWayPotential}. Our analysis reveals that the majority of these HiVels are metal-poor late-type giants, and we show 9 HiVels that are unbound candidates to the Galaxy with escape probabilities of 50\%. To investigate the origins of these HiVels, we classify them into four categories and consider the impact of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) potential on their backward-integration trajectories. Specifically, we find that one of the HiVels can track back to the Galactic Center, and three HiVels may originate from the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph). Furthermore, some HiVels appear to be ejected from the Galactic disk, while others formed within the Milky Way or have an extragalactic origin. Given that the LMC has a significant impact on the orbits of Sgr dSph, we examine the reported HiVels that originate from the Sgr dSph, with a few of them passing within the half-light radius of the Sgr dSph.
#### Dust and Volatiles in the Disintegrating Comet C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS)

 - **Abstract**
 C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) is an Oort cloud comet with an orbital period of $\sim$5895$\,{\rm yr}$. Starting in March 2020, its nucleus underwent disintegration. In order to investigate the gas and dust properties of C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) during its disintegration, we obtained long-slit spectra at 3600--8700$\,{\rm\mathring{A}}$ and $BVRI$ multi-band images with the Xinglong 2.16-Meter Telescope in April 2020. Our observations revealed that C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) exhibited strong emission bands of CN, C$_2$, C$_3$, and NH$_2$ which are superimposed on a dust scattering continuum, typical of cometary spectra in the optical. The production rates of CN, C$_2$, and C$_3$ derived using the Haser model and the corresponding C$_2$/CN and C$_3$/CN ratios suggest that C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) is a ``typical'' Oort cloud comet under the A'Hearn classification, although it appears less dusty as revealed by the $Af\rho$ quantities. Its dust-scattering reflectivity is slightly red, with a gradient of $\sim$5% per $10^3\,{\rm\mathring{A}}$. We model the reflectivity gradient in terms of porous dust and find that the red color is accounted for by porous dust.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a numerical study of the evolution of power-law tails (PLTs) in the (column-)density distributions ($N$-PDF, $\rho$-PDF) in contracting star-forming clumps in primordial gas, without and with some initial rotational and/or turbulent support. In all considered runs multiple PLTs emerge shortly after the formation of the first protostar. The first PLT (PLT 1) in the $\rho$-PDF is a stable feature with slope $q_1\simeq -1.3$ which corresponds -- under the condition of preserved spherical symmetry -- to the outer envelope of the protostellar object with density profile $\rho\propto l^{-2}$ in the classical Larson-Penston collapse model, where $l$ is the radius. The second PLT (PLT 2) in the $\rho$-PDF is stable in the pure-infall runs but fluctuates significantly in the runs with initial support against gravity as dozens of protostars form and their mutual tidal forces change the density structure. Its mean slope, $\langle q_2\rangle\simeq -2$, corresponds to a density profile of $\rho\propto l^{-3/2}$ which describes a core in free fall in the classical Larson-Penston collapse model or an attractor solution at scales with dominating protostellar gravity. PLT 1 and PLT 2 in the $N$-PDFs are generally consistent with the observational data of Galactic low-mass star-forming regions from {\it Herschel} data. In the runs with initial support against gravity a third PLT (PLT~3) in the $\rho$-PDFs appears simultaneously with or after the emergence of PLT 2. It is very shallow, with mean slope of $\langle q_3\rangle\simeq -1$, and is associated with the formation of thin protostellar accretion disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent astrophysical mass inferences of compact stars (CSs) HESS J1731-347 and PSR J0952-0607, with extremely small and large masses respectively, as well as the measurement of the neutron skin of Ca in the CREX experiment challenge and constrain the models of dense matter. In this work, we examine the concept of hybrid stars - objects containing quark cores surrounded by nucleonic envelopes - as models that account for these new data along with other (multimessenger) inferences. We employ a family of 81 nucleonic equations of state (EoSs) based on covariant density functional with variable skewness and slope of symmetry energy at saturation density and a constant speed-of-sound EoS for quark matter. For each nucleonic EoS, a family of hybrid star EoS is generated by varying the transition density from nucleonic to quark matter, the density jump at the transition, and the speed-of-sound. These models are tested against the data from GW170817 and J1731-347, which favor low-density soft EoS and PSR J0592-0607 and J0740+6620, which require high-density stiff EoS. We then examine the occurrence of twin configurations and quantify the ranges of masses and radii that they can possess. It is shown that including J1731-347 data favors EoS models which predict low-mass twin stars with masses $M \lesssim 1.3\,M_{\odot}$ that can be realized if the deconfinement transition density is low. If combined with a large speed-of-sound in quark matter such models allow for maximum masses of hybrid stars in the range $2.0$-$2.6\,M_{\odot}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. The initial stages of planet formation may start concurrently with the formation of a gas-dust protoplanetary disk. This makes the study of the earliest stages of protoplanetary disk formation crucially important. Here we focus on dust growth and pebble formation in a protoplanetary disk that is still accreting from a parental cloud core. Methods. We have developed an original three-dimensional numerical hydrodynamics code, which computes the collapse of rotating clouds and disk formation on nested meshes using a novel hybrid Coarray Fortran-OpenMP approach for distributed and shared memory parallelization. Dust dynamics and growth are also included in the simulations. Results. We found that the dust growth from $\sim 1~\mu$m to 1-10~mm already occurs in the initial few thousand years of disk evolution but the Stokes number hardly exceeds 0.1 because of higher disk densities and temperatures compared to the minimum mass Solar nebular. The ratio of the dust-to-gas vertical scale heights remains rather modest, 0.2--0.5, which may be explained by the perturbing action of spiral arms that develop in the disk soon after its formation. The dust-to-gas mass ratio in the disk midplane is highly nonhomogeneous throughout the disk extent and is in general enhanced by a factor of several compared to the fiducial 1:100 value. Low St hinders strong dust accumulation in the spiral arms compared to the rest of the disk and the nonsteady nature of the spirals is also an obstacle. The spatial distribution of pebbles in the disk midplane exhibits a highly nonhomogeneous and patchy character. The total mass of pebbles in the disk increases with time and reaches a few tens of Earth masses after a few tens of thousand years of disk evolution. Abridged.
#### Deconstructing Photospheric Spectral Lines in Solar and Stellar Flares

 - **Abstract**
 During solar flares, spectral lines formed in the photosphere have been shown to exhibit changes to their profiles despite the challenges of energy transfer to these depths. Recent work has shown that deep-forming spectral lines are subject to significant contributions from regions above the photosphere throughout the flaring period, resulting in a composite emergent intensity profile from multiple layers of the atmosphere. We employ radiative-hydrodynamic and radiative transfer calculations to simulate the response of the solar/stellar atmosphere to electron beam heating and synthesize spectral lines of Fe I to investigate the line-of-sight velocity fields information available from Doppler shifts of the emergent intensity profile. By utilizing the contribution function to deconstruct the line profile shape into its constituent sources, we show that variations in the line profiles are primarily caused by changes in the chromosphere. Up-flows in this region were found to create blueshifts or "false" redshifts in the line core dependent on the relative contribution of the chromosphere compared to the photosphere. In extreme solar and stellar flare scenarios featuring explosive chromospheric condensations, red-shifted transient components can dominate the temporal evolution of the profile shape, requiring a tertiary component consideration to fully characterize. We conclude that deep-forming lines require a multi-component understanding and treatment, with different regions of the spectral line being useful for probing individual regions of the atmosphere's velocity flows.
#### Hydrodynamic Simulations of Oxygen-Neon Classical Novae as Galactic  $^7$Li Producers and Potential Accretion Induced Collapse Progenitors

 - **Abstract**
 We report on studies of Classical Nova (CN) explosions where we follow the evolution of thermonuclear runaways (TNRs) on oxygen-neon (ONe) white dwarfs (WDs). Using NOVA, a one-dimensional hydrodynamic computer code, we accrete Solar matter until the TNR is ongoing and then switch to a mixed composition. This approach is guided by the results of multi-dimensional studies of TNRs in WDs which find that sufficient mixing with WD core material occurs after the TNR is well underway, and levels of enrichment of the CNONeMg elements are reached that agree with observations of CN ejecta abundances. Because the amount of accreted material is inversely proportional to the oxygen abundance, by first accreting Solar matter, the amount of accreted material is larger than in those simulations with an initially enriched composition. We vary the mass of the WD (from 0.6 Msun to 1.35 Msun) and the composition of the mixed materials. Our results show large enrichments of 7Be in the ejected gases implying that ONe CNe and CO CNe (Starrfield et al. 2020) may be responsible for a significant fraction (about 100 Msun) of the galactic 7Li ( about 1000 Msun). The production of 22Na and 26Al in CN explosions and the gamma-ray emission predicted by our simulations is discussed. The WDs in all our simulations eject less material than they accrete and we predict that the WD is growing in mass as a consequence of the CN outburst. ONe CNe, therefore, may be an important channel for accretion induced collapse (AIC) events.
#### Trigonometric parallax and proper motion of Sagittarius A* measured by  VERA using the new broad-band back-end system OCTAVE-DAS

 - **Abstract**
 We successfully measured the trigonometric parallax of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) to be $117\pm17$ micro-arcseconds ($\mu$as) using the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA) with the newly developed broad-band signal-processing system named OCTAVE-DAS. The measured parallax corresponds to a Galactocentric distance at the Sun of $R_0 = 8.5^{+1.5}_{-1.1}$ kpc. By combining the astrometric results with VERA and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) over a monitoring period of 25 years, the proper motion of Sgr A* is obtained to be $(\mu_\alpha, \mu_\delta) = (-3.133\pm0.003, -5.575\pm0.005)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ in equatorial coordinates, corresponding to $(\mu_l, \mu_b) = (-6.391\pm0.005, -0.230\pm0.004)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ in Galactic coordinates. This gives an angular orbital velocity of the Sun of $\Omega_\odot = 30.30 \pm 0.02$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. We find upper limits to the core wander, $\Delta \theta < 0.20$ mas (1.6 AU), peculiar motion, $\Delta \mu < 0.10$ mas yr$^{-1}$ (3.7 km s$^{-1}$), and acceleration, $a < 2.6$ $\mu$as yr$^{-2}$ (0.10 km s$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$) for Sgr A*. Thus, we obtained upper mass limits of $\approx$ 3 $\times$ 10$^{4}$$M_{\odot}$ and $\approx$ 3 $\times$ 10$^{3}$$M_{\odot}$ for the supposed intermediate-mass black holes at 0.1 and 0.01 pc from the Galactic center, respectively.
#### Exploring the dependence of chemical traits on metallicity: chemical  trends for red giant stars with asteroseismic ages

 - **Abstract**
 Given the massive spectroscopic surveys and the Gaia mission, the Milky Way has turned into a unique laboratory to be explored using abundance ratios that show a strong dependency with time. Within this framework, the data provided through asteroseismology serve as a valuable complement. Yet, it has been demonstrated that chemical traits can not be used as universal relations across the Galaxy. To complete this picture, it is important to investigate the dependence on metallicity of the chemical ratios employed for inferring stellar ages. We aim to explore different combinations of neutron-capture, odd-Z and $\alpha$ elements as a function of age, particularly focusing on their metallicity dependence for a sample of 74 giant field stars. Using UVES observations, we derive atmospheric parameters and high-precision line by line chemical abundances (<0.04 dex) for the entire set of spectra. Stellar ages are inferred from astereoseismic information. By fitting chemical-age trends for three different metallicity groups, we estimated their dependence on metallicity. We found that the stronger chemical-age relations ([Zr/$\alpha$]) are not necessarily the ratios with the smaller dependence on metallicity ([Ce/$\alpha$] and [Ce/Eu]). We confirm the [n-capture/$\alpha$]-age trends for evolved stars, wherein the most significant correlation is evident in stars with solar-metallicity, gradually diminishing in stars with lower iron content. The lack of homogeneity within the metallicity range highlights the intricate nature of our Galaxy's star formation history and yield production. Metallicity dependence in s-process element yields and the impact of radial stellar migration challenge the reliability of using chemical abundances alone to date stars. These discoveries raise doubts about universally valid chemical clocks applicable across the entire Galaxy and its diverse metallicity ranges.
#### Bright Supernova Precursors by Outbursts from Massive Stars with Compact  Object Companions

 - **Abstract**
 A fraction of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) with signs of interaction with a dense circumstellar matter are preceded by bright precursor emission. While the precursors are likely caused by a mass ejection before core-collapse, their mechanism to power energetic bursts, sometimes reaching $10^{48}$--$10^{49}\ {\rm erg}$ that are larger than the binding energies of red supergiant envelopes, is still under debate. Remarkably, such a huge energy-deposition should result in an almost complete envelope ejection and hence a strong sign of interaction, but the observed SNe with precursors show in fact typical properties among the interacting SNe. More generally, the observed luminosity of $10^{40-42}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ is shown to be challenging for a single SN progenitor. To resolve these tensions, we propose a scenario where the progenitor is in a binary system with a compact object (CO), and an outburst from the star leads to a super-Eddington accretion onto the CO. We show that for sufficiently short separations, outbursts with moderate initial kinetic energies of $10^{46}$--$10^{47}$ erg can be energized by the accreting CO so that their radiative output can be consistent with the observed precursors. We discuss the implications of our model in relation to CO binaries detectable with Gaia and gravitational wave detectors.
