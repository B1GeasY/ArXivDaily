#### Sequential formation of supermassive stars and heavy seed BHs through the interplay of cosmological cold accretion and stellar radiative feedback

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive stars (SMSs) and heavy seed black holes, as their remnants, are promising candidates for Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) progenitors, especially for ones observed in the early universe $ z\simeq 8.5-10$ by recent JWST observations. Expected cradles of SMSs are the atomic cooling halos ($M_{\rm halo}\simeq 10^7~{\rm M_\odot}$), where "cold accretion" emerges and possibly forms SMSs. We perform a suit of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations and investigate star formation after the emergence of cold accretion, solving radiative feedback from stars inside the halo. We follow the mass growth of the protostars for $\sim 3~{\rm Myr}$, resolving the gas inflow down to $\sim 0.1~{\rm pc}$ scales. We discover that, after cold accretion emerges, multiple SMSs of $m_\star \gtrsim 10^5{\rm M_\odot}$ form at the halo centre with the accretion rates maintained at $\dot{m}_\star \simeq 0.04~{\rm M_\odot}~{\rm yr^{-1}}$ for $\lesssim 3~{\rm Myr}$. Cold accretion supplies gas at a rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm gas}\gtrsim 0.01-0.1~{\rm M_\odot}~{\rm yr^{-1}}$ from outside the halo virial radius to the central gas disc. Gravitational torques from spiral arms transport gas further inward, which feeds the SMSs. Radiative feedback from stars suppresses H$_2$ cooling and disc fragmentation, while photoevaporation is prevented by a dense envelope, which attenuates ionising radiation. Our results suggest that cold accretion can bring efficient BH mass growth after seed formation in the later universe. Moreover, cold accretion and gas migration inside the central disc increase the mass concentration and provide a promising formation site for the extremely compact stellar clusters observed by JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 Mass segregation is seen in many star clusters, but whether massive stars form in the center of a cluster or migrate there dynamically is still debated. N-body simulations have shown that early dynamical mass segregation is possible when sub-clusters merge to form a dense core with a small crossing time. However, the effect of gas dynamics on both the formation and dynamics of the stars could inhibit the formation of the dense core. We aim to study the dynamical mass segregation of star cluster models that include gas dynamics and self-consistently form stars from the dense substructure in the gas. Our models use the Torch framework, which is based on AMUSE and includes stellar and magnetized gas dynamics, as well as stellar evolution and feedback from radiation, stellar winds, and supernovae. Our models consist of three star clusters forming from initial turbulent spherical clouds of mass $10^{4,5,6}\rm~M_\odot$ and radius $11.7\rm~pc$ that have final stellar masses of $3.6\times10^3\rm~M_\odot$, $6.5\times10^4\rm~M_\odot$, and $8.9\times10^5\rm~M_\odot$, respectively. There is no primordial mass segregation in the model by construction. All three clusters become dynamically mass segregated at early times via collapse confirming that this mechanism occurs within sub-clusters forming directly out of the dense substructure in the gas. The dynamics of the embedded gas and stellar feedback do not inhibit the collapse of the cluster. We find that each model cluster becomes mass segregated within $2~$Myr of the onset of star formation, reaching the levels observed in young clusters in the Milky Way. However, we note that the exact values are highly time-variable during these early phases of evolution. Massive stars that segregate to the center during core collapse are likely to be dynamically ejected, a process that can decrease the overall level of mass segregation again.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting mid-infrared (MIR) radiation has significant astronomical applications, although limited by unsatisfactory MIR detectors. Here we reported on the realization of a MIR up-conversion interferometer based on synthetic long base-line (SLBL) in the laboratory. The experimental system consisted of an interferometer and subsequent up-conversion detection part of mid-infrared signal, which streamlined the structure and enhanced the reliability of the system. By using a tungsten filament lamp as an imitated star, we not only achieved the single target angle resolution of 1.10 times 10^(-4) rad, but also obtained the field angle resolution of 3.0 times 10^(-4) rad of double star targets. The angular resolution is in inverse proportion to the length of baseline. The maximum length of simulated baseline in the laboratory is about 3cm. In a Keck Interferometer (KI) liked program, the base line can reach up to 85m leading to a corresponding angular resolution of 3.0 times 10^(-9) rad (about 1.8mas). The study will offer potential benefits in extending the usage of mid-infrared light in astronomical exploration.
#### Unveiling the central engine of core-collapse supernovae in the Local Universe: NS or BH?

 - **Abstract**
 The physical trigger powering supernovae following the core collapse of massive stars is believed to involve a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH), depending largely on progenitor mass. A potentially distinct signature is a long-duration gravitational wave (GW) burst from BH central engines by their ample energy reservoir $E_J$ in angular momentum, far more so than an NS can provide. A natural catalyst for this radiation is surrounding high-density matter in the form of a non-axisymmetric disk or torus. Here, we derive a detailed outlook on LVK probes of core-collapse supernovae CC-SNe during the present observational run O4 based on their event rate, an association with normal long GRBs and mass-scaling of GW170817B/GRB170817A. For BH central engines of mass $M$, GW170817B predicts a descending GW-chirp of energy ${\cal E}_{GW}\simeq 3.5\% M_\odot c^2 \left(M/M_0\right)$ at frequency $f_{GW}\lesssim 700\,{\rm Hz}\left(M_0/M\right)$, where $M_0\simeq 2.8\,M_\odot$. For a few tens of events per year well into the Local Universe within 50-100Mpc, probes at the detector-limited sensitivity are expected to break the degeneracy between their NS or BH central engines {by GW calorimetry.

 - **Abstract**
 The population of short-period giant exoplanets around M-dwarf stars is slowly rising. These planets present an extraordinary opportunity for atmospheric characterisation and defy our current understanding of planetary formation. Furthermore, clouds and hazes are ubiquitous in warm exoplanets but their behaviour is still poorly understood. We study the case of a standard warm Jupiter around a M-dwarf star to show the opportunity of this exoplanet population for atmospheric characterisation. We aim to derive the cloud, haze, and chemical budget of such planets using JWST. We leverage a 3D Global Climate Model, the generic PCM, to simulate the cloudy and cloud-free atmosphere of warm Jupiters around a M-dwarf. We then post-process our simulations to produce spectral phase curves and transit spectra as would be seen with JWST.We show that using the amplitude and offset of the spectral phase curves, we can directly infer the presence of clouds and hazes in the atmosphere of such giant planets. Chemical characterisation of multiple species is possible with an unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio, using the transit spectrum in one single visit. In such atmospheres, NH3 could be detected for the first time in a giant exoplanet. We make the case that these planets are key to understanding the cloud and haze budget in warm giants. Finally, such planets are targets of great interest for Ariel.
#### A Yebes W band Line Survey towards an Unshocked Molecular Cloud of Supernova Remnant 3C391: Evidence of Cosmic-Ray-Induced Chemistry

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays (CRs) have strong influences on the chemistry of dense molecular clouds (MCs). To study the detailed chemistry induced by CRs, we conducted a Yebes W band line survey towards an unshocked MC (which we named as 3C391:NML) associated with supernova remnant (SNR) 3C391. We detected emission lines of 18 molecular species in total and estimated their column densities with local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE analysis. Using the abundance ratio N(HCO+)/N(CO) and an upper limit of N(DCO+)/N(HCO+), we estimated the CR ionization rate of 3C391:NML is $\zeta\gtrsim 2.7\times 10^{-14}\rm \ s^{-1}$ with an analytic method. However, we caution on adopting this value because chemical equilibrium, which is a prerequisite of using the equations, is not necessarily reached in 3C391:NML. We observed lower N(HCO+)/N(HOC+), higher N(HCS+)/N(CS), and higher X($l$-C3H+) by an order of magnitude in 3C391:NML than the typical values in quiescent dense MCs. We found that an enhanced CR ionization rate (of order $\sim 10^{-15}$ or $\sim 10^{-14}\rm \ s^{-1}$) is needed to reproduce the observation with chemical model. This is higher than the values found in typical MCs by 2--3 orders of magnitude.

 - **Abstract**
 We present deep, wideband multifrequency radio observations (144 MHz$-$8 GHz) of the remarkable galaxy group NGC 741, which yield crucial insights into the interaction between the infalling head-tail radio galaxy (NGC 742) and the main group. Our new data provide an unprecedentedly detailed view of the NGC 741-742 system, including the shock cone, disrupted jets from NGC 742, the long ($\sim$ 255 kpc) braided southern radio tail, and eastern lobe-like structure, and reveal, for the first time, complex radio filaments throughout the tail and lobe, and a likely vortex ring behind the shock cone. The cone traces the bow shock caused by the supersonic ($\mathcal{M}\sim2$) interaction between the head-tail radio galaxy NGC 742 and the intragroup medium (IGrM) while the ring may have been formed by interaction between the NGC 742 shock and a previously existing lobe associated with NGC 741. This interaction plausibly compressed and re-accelerated the radio plasma. We estimate that shock-heating by NGC 742 has likely injected $\sim$2-5$\times$10$^{57}$ erg of thermal energy into the central 10 kpc cooling region of the IGrM, potentially affecting the cooling and feedback cycle of NGC 741. A comparison with Chandra X-ray images shows that some of the previously detected thermal filaments align with radio edges, suggesting compression of the IGrM as the relativistic plasma of the NGC 742 tail interacts with the surrounding medium. Our results highlight that multi-frequency observations are key to disentangling the complex, intertwined origins of the variety of radio features seen in the galaxy group NGC 741, and the need for simulations to reproduce all the detected features.
