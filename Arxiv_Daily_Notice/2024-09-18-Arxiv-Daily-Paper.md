#### S2-star dynamics probing the Galaxy core cluster

 - **Abstract**
 The star cluster surrounding the supermassive black hole in the center of Milky Way is probed using the data on the S2 star. The value of precession found at the physics-informed neural networks (PINN) analysis of the S2 data is used to consider the role of the scattering of S2 star on stars of the cluster, described by a random force given by the Holtsmark distribution. The critical value for the star density of the core cluster for which the observed precession value by PINN lies inside 70\% confidence interval (between 15\% and 85\% quantiles) around the median of precession due to scattering, is obtained as n_crit \approx 8.3 10^6 pc^-3, that is at higher star densities the perturbation of the orbit of S2 would exceed the observed one.

 - **Abstract**
 Type IIn supernovae (SNeIIn) are a highly heterogeneous subclass of core-collapse supernovae, spectroscopically characterized by signatures of interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). Here we systematically model the light curves of 142 archival SNeIIn using MOSFiT (the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients). We find that the observed and inferred properties of SNIIn are diverse, but there are some trends. The typical SN CSM is dense ($\sim$10$^{-12}$gcm$^{-3}$) with highly diverse CSM geometry, with a median CSM mass of $\sim$1M$_\odot$. The ejecta are typically massive ($\gtrsim10$M$_\odot$), suggesting massive progenitor systems. We find positive correlations between the CSM mass and the rise and fall times of SNeIIn. Furthermore there are positive correlations between the rise time and fall times and the $r$-band luminosity. We estimate the mass-loss rates of our sample (where spectroscopy is available) and find a high median mass-loss rate of $\sim$10$^{-2}$M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$, with a range between 10$^{-4}$--1M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$. These mass-loss rates are most similar to the mass loss from great eruptions of luminous blue variables, consistent with the direct progenitor detections in the literature. We also discuss the role that binary interactions may play, concluding that at least some of our SNeIIn may be from massive binary systems. Finally, we estimate a detection rate of 1.6$\times$10$^5$yr$^{-1}$ in the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.
#### Effects of secular growth and mergers on the evolution of metallicity gradients and azimuthal variations in a Milky Way-like galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the evolution of the radial profiles and the azimuthal variations of the stellar metallicities from the Vintergatan simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy. We find that negative gradients exist as soon as the disk settles at high redshift, and are maintained throughout the long term evolution of the galaxy, including during major merger events. The inside-out growth of the disk and an overall outward radial migration tend to flatten these gradients in time. Major merger events only have a moderate and short-lived imprint on the [Fe/H] distributions with almost no radial dependence. The reason lies in the timescale for enrichment in Fe being significantly longer than the duration of the starbursts episodes, themselves slower than dynamical mixing during typical interactions. It results that signatures of major mergers become undetectable in [Fe/H] only a few Myr after pericenter passages. We note that considering other tracers like the warm interstellar medium, or monitoring the evolution of the metallicity gradient as a single value instead of a radial full profile could lead to different interpretations, and warn against an oversimplification of this complex problem.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Computational astronomy has reached the stage where running a gravitational N-body simulation of a stellar system, such as a Milky Way star cluster, is computationally feasible, but a major limiting factor that remains is the ability to set up physically realistic initial conditions. Aims. We aim to obtain realistic initial conditions for N-body simulations by taking advantage of machine learning, with emphasis on reproducing small-scale interstellar distance distributions. Methods. The computational bottleneck for obtaining such distance distributions is the hydrodynamics of star formation, which ultimately determine the features of the stars, including positions, velocities, and masses. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a new method for sampling physically realistic initial conditions from a limited set of simulations using Gaussian processes. Results. We evaluated the resulting sets of initial conditions based on whether they meet tests for physical realism. We find that direct sampling based on the learned distribution of the star features fails to reproduce binary systems. Consequently, we show that physics-informed sampling algorithms solve this issue, as they are capable of generating realisations closer to reality.
#### The Sun's Birth Environment: Context for Meteoritics

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10638

 - **Abstract**
 Meteorites trace planet formation in the Sun's protoplanetary disk, but they also record the influence of the Sun's birth environment. Whether the Sun formed in a region like Taurus-Auriga with ~10^2 stars, or a region like the Carina Nebula with ~10^6 stars, matters for how large the Sun's disk was, for how long and from how far away it accreted gas from the molecular cloud, and how it acquired radionuclides like 26Al. To provide context for the interpretation of meteoritic data, we review what is known about the Sun's birth environment. Based on an inferred gas disk outer radius ~50-90 AU, radial transport in the disk, and the abundances of noble gases in Jupiter's atmosphere, the Sun's molecular cloud and protoplanetary disk were exposed to an ultraviolet flux G0 ~30-3000 during its birth and first ~10 Myr of evolution. Based on the orbits of Kuiper Belt objects, the Solar System was subsequently exposed to a stellar density ~100 Msol/pc^3 for ~100 Myr, strongly implying formation in a bound cluster. These facts suggest formation in a region like the outskirts of the Orion Nebula, perhaps 2 pc from the center. The protoplanetary disk might have accreted gas for many Myr, but a few x10^5 yr seems more likely. It probably inherited radionuclides from its molecular cloud, enriched by inputs from supernovae and especially Wolf-Rayet star winds, and acquired a typical amount of 26Al.
#### The Spin Zone: Synchronously and Asynchronously Rotating Exoplanets Have Spectral Differences in Transmission

 - **Abstract**
 New observational facilities are beginning to enable insights into the three-dimensional (3D) nature of exoplanets. Transmission spectroscopy is the most widely used method for characterizing transiting temperate exoplanet's atmospheres, but because it only provides a glimpse of the planet's limb and nightside for a typical orbit, its ability to probe 3D characteristics is still an active area of research. Here, we use the ROCKE-3D general circulation model to test the impact of rotation rate, a ``low-order'' 3D characteristic previously shown to drive differences in planetary phase curves, on the transmission spectrum of a representative super-Earth across temperate-to-warm instellations (S$_p$=0.8, 1, 1.25, 1.66, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 4.56 S$_\oplus$). We find that different rotation regimes do display differences in their transmission spectra, primarily driven by clouds and humidity, and that the differences shrink or disappear in hotter regimes where water clouds are unable to condense (though our simulations do not consider haze formation). The small size of the feature differences and potential for degeneracy with other properties, like differing water content or atmospheric structure, mean that we do not specifically claim to have identified a single transmission diagnostic for rotation rate, but our results can be used for holistic spectrum interpretation and sample creation, and suggest the need for more modelling in this area.
#### Impact of current uncertainties in the 12C+12C nuclear reaction rate on intermediate-mass stars and massive white dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 Recent determinations of the total rate of the 12C+12C nuclear reaction show non-negligible differences with the reference reaction rate commonly used in previous stellar simulations. In addition, the current uncertainties in determining each exit channel constitute one of the main uncertainties in shaping the inner structure of super asymptotic giant branch stars that could have a measurable impact on the properties of pulsating ultra-massive white dwarfs (WDs). We explore how new determinations of the nuclear reaction rate and its branching ratios affect the evolution of WD progenitors. We show that the current uncertainties in the branching ratios constitute the main uncertainty factor in determining the inner composition of ultra-massive WDs and their progenitors. We found that the use of extreme branching ratios leads to differences in the central abundances of 20Ne of at most 17%, which are translated into differences of at most 1.3 and 0.8% in the cooling times and size of the crystallized core. However, the impact on the pulsation properties is small, less than 1 s for the asymptotic period spacing. We found that the carbon burns partially in the interior of ultra-massive WD progenitors within a particular range of masses, leaving a hybrid CONe-core composition in their cores. The evolution of these new kinds of predicted objects differs substantially from the evolution of objects with pure CO cores. Differences in the size of the crystallized core and cooling times of up to 15 and 6%, respectively leading to distinct patterns in the period spacing distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations show that globular clusters might be among the best places to find millisecond pulsars. However, the globular cluster Terzan 6 seems to be an exception without any pulsar discovered, although its high stellar encounter rate suggests that it harbors dozens of them. We report the discovery of the first radio pulsar, PSR J1751-3116A, likely associated with Terzan 6 in a search of C-band (4-8 GHz) data from the Green Bank Telescope with a spin period of 5.33 ms and dispersion measure, DM$\simeq$383 ${\rm pc~cm^{-3}}$. The mean flux density of this pulsar is approximately 3 ${\rm \mu Jy}$. The DM agrees well with predictions from the Galactic free electron density model, assuming a distance of 6.7 kpc for Terzan 6. PSR J1751-3116A is likely an isolated millisecond pulsar, potentially formed through dynamical interactions, considering the core-collapsed classification and the exceptionally high stellar encounter rate of Terzan 6. This is the highest radio frequency observation that has led to the discovery of a pulsar in a globular cluster to date. While L-band (1-2 GHz) observations of this cluster are unlikely to yield significant returns due to propagation effects, we predict that further pulsar discoveries in Terzan 6 will be made by existing radio telescopes at higher frequencies.
#### Stable Case BB/BC Mass Transfer to Form GW190425-like Massive Binary Neutron Star Mergers

 - **Abstract**
 On April 25th, 2019, the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration discovered a Gravitational-wave (GW) signal from a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, i.e., GW190425. Due to the inferred large total mass, the origin of GW190425 remains unclear. We perform detailed stellar structure and binary evolution calculations that take into account mass-loss, internal differential rotation, and tidal interactions between a He-rich star and a NS companion. We explore the parameter space of the initial binary properties, including initial NS and He-rich masses and initial orbital period. We find that the immediate post-common-envelope progenitor system, consisting of a primary $\sim2.0\,M_\odot$ ($\sim1.7\,M_\odot$) NS and a secondary He-rich star with an initial mass of $\sim3.0-5.5\,M_\odot$ ($\sim5.5-6.0\,M_\odot$) in a close binary with an initial period of $\sim0.08-0.5\,{\rm{days}}$ ($\sim 0.08-0.4\,{\rm{days}}$), that experiences stable Case BB/BC mass transfer (MT) during binary evolution, can reproduce the formation of GW190425-like BNS events. Our studies reveal that the secondary He-rich star of the GW190425's progenitor before its core collapse can be efficiently spun up through tidal interaction, finally remaining as a NS with rotational energy even reaching $\sim10^{52}\,{\rm{erg}}$, which is always much higher than the neutrino-driven energy of the supernova (SN) explosion. If the newborn secondary NS is a magnetar, we expect that GW190425 can be the remnant of a magnetar-driven SN, e.g., a magnetar-driven ultra-stripped SN, a superluminous SN, or a broad-line Type Ic SN. Our results show that GW190425 could be formed through the isolated binary evolution, which involves a stable Case BB/BC MT just after the common envelope phase. On top of that, we show the He-rich star can be tidally spun up, potentially forming a spinning magnetized NS (magnetar) during the second SN explosion.

 - **Abstract**
 We present here results of numerical simulations of the formation and early evolution of rocky planets through pebble accretion, with an with an emphasis on hydrogen envelope longevity and the composition of the outgassed atmosphere. We model planets with a range in mass from 0.1 to 5 Earth masses that orbit between 0.7 and 1.7 AU. The composition of the outgassed atmosphere is calculated with the partial pressure of free oxygen fit to geophysical models of magma ocean self-oxidation. XUV radiation powered photoevaporation is considered as the main driver of atmospheric escape. We model planets that remain below the pebble isolation mass and hence accrete tenuous envelopes only. We consider slow, medium or fast initial stellar rotation for the temporal evolution of the XUV flux. The loss of the envelope is a key event that allows the magma ocean to crystallise and outgas its bulk volatiles. The atmospheric composition of the majority of our simulated planets is dominated by CO$_2$. Our planets accrete a total of 11.6 Earth oceans of water, the majority of which enters the core. The hydrospheres of planets lighter than the Earth reach several times the mass of the Earth's modern oceans, while the hydrospheres of planets ranging from 1 to 3.5 Earth masses are comparable to those of our planet. However, planets of 4-5 Earth masses have smaller hydrospheres due to trapping of volatiles in their massive mantles. Overall, our simulations demonstrate that hydrogen envelopes are easily lost from rocky planets and that this envelope loss triggers the most primordial partitioning of volatiles between the solid mantle and the atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 The exoplanet sub-Neptune population currently poses a conundrum. Are small-size planets volatile-rich cores without atmosphere, or are they rocky cores surrounded by H-He envelope? To test the different hypotheses from an observational point of view, a large sample of small-size planets with precise mass and radius measurements is the first necessary step. On top of that, much more information will likely be needed, including atmospheric characterisation and a demographic perspective on their bulk properties. We present the concept and strategy of THIRSTEE, a project which aims at shedding light on the composition of the sub-Neptune population across stellar types by increasing their number and improving the accuracy of bulk density measurements, as well as investigating their atmospheres and performing statistical, demographic analysis. We report the first results of the program, characterising a 2-planet system around the M dwarf TOI-406. We analyse TESS and ground-based photometry, together with ESPRESSO and NIRPS/HARPS RVs to derive the orbital parameters and investigate the internal composition of the 2 planets orbiting TOI-406, which have radii and masses of $R_b = 1.32 \pm 0.12 R_{\oplus}$, $M_b = 2.08_{-0.22}^{+0.23} M_{\oplus}$ and $R_c = 2.08_{-0.15}^{+0.16} R_{\oplus}$, $M_c = 6.57_{-0.90}^{+1.00} M_{\oplus}$, and periods of $3.3$ and $13.2$ days, respectively. Planet b is consistent with an Earth-like composition, while planet c is compatible with multiple internal composition models, including volatile-rich planets without H/He atmospheres. The 2 planets are located in 2 distinct regions in the mass-density diagram, supporting the existence of a density gap among small exoplanets around M dwarfs. With an equilibrium temperature of only 368 K, TOI-406 c stands up as a particularly interesting target for atmospheric characterisation with JWST in the low-temperature regime.
#### The Impact of Icy Cometary 'Impacts' on Exoplanetary Atmospheres I: Tidally-Locked Terrestrial Exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 Impacts by rocky and icy bodies are thought to have played a key role in shaping the composition of solar system objects, including the Earth's habitability. Hence, it is likely that they play a similar role in exoplanetary systems. We investigate how an icy cometary impact affects the atmospheric chemistry, climate, and composition of an Earth-like, tidally-locked, terrestrial exoplanet, a prime target in the search for a habitable exoplanet beyond our solar system. We couple a cometary impact model which includes thermal ablation and pressure driven breakup with the 3D Earth System Model WACCM6/CESM2, and use this model to investigate the effects of the water and thermal energy delivery associated with an $R=2.5$ km pure water ice cometary impact on an Earth-like atmosphere. We find that water is the primary driver of longer timescale changes to the atmospheric chemistry and composition by acting as a source of opacity, cloud ice, and atmospheric hydrogen/oxygen. The water opacity drives heating at $\sim5\times10^{-4}$ bar, and cooling below, due to a decreased flux reaching the surface. The increase in atmospheric hydrogen and oxygen also drives an increase in the abundance of hydrogen/oxygen rich molecules, with the exception of ozone, whose column density decreases by $\sim10\%$. These atmospheric changes are potentially observable for $\sim$ 1-2 years post-impact, particularly those associated with cloud ice scattering. They also persist, albeit at a much reduced level, to our quasi-steady-state, suggesting that sustained bombardment or multiple large impacts have the potential to shape the composition and habitability of terrestrial exoplanets.
#### Imaging fermionic dark matter cores at the center of galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Current images of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) candidates at the center of our Galaxy and M87 have opened an unprecedented era for studying strong gravity and the nature of relativistic sources. Very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) data show images consistent with a central SMBH within General Relativity (GR). However, it is essential to consider whether other well-motivated dark compact objects within GR could produce similar images. Recent studies have shown that dark matter (DM) halos modeled as self-gravitating systems of neutral fermions can harbor very dense fermionic cores at their centers, which can mimic the spacetime features of a black hole (BH). Such dense, horizonless DM cores can satisfy the observational constraints: they can be supermassive and compact and lack a hard surface. We investigate whether such cores can produce similar observational signatures to those of BHs when illuminated by an accretion disk. We compute images and spectra of the fermion cores with a general-relativistic ray tracing technique, assuming the radiation originates from standard $\alpha$ disks, which are self-consistently solved within the current DM framework. Our simulated images possess a central brightness depression surrounded by a ring-like feature, resembling what is expected in the BH scenario. For Milky Way-like halos, the central brightness depressions have diameters down to $\sim 35\, \mu$as as measured from a distance of approximately $8\,$kpc. Finally, we show that the DM cores do not possess photon rings, a key difference from the BH paradigm, which could help discriminate between the models.
#### Quartz Clouds in the Dayside Atmosphere of the Quintessential Hot Jupiter HD 189733 b

 - **Abstract**
 Recent mid-infrared observations with JWST/MIRI have resulted in the first direct detections of absorption features from silicate clouds in the transmission spectra of two transiting exoplanets, WASP-17 b and WASP-107 b. In this paper, we measure the mid-infrared ($5-12$ $\mu$m) dayside emission spectrum of the benchmark hot Jupiter HD 189733 b with MIRI LRS by combining data from two secondary eclipse observations. We confirm the previous detection of H$_2$O absorption at 6.5 $\mu$m from Spitzer/IRS and additionally detect H$_2$S as well as an absorption feature at 8.7 $\mu$m in both secondary eclipse observations. The excess absorption at 8.7 $\mu$m can be explained by the presence of small ($\sim$0.01 $\mu$m) grains of SiO$_2$[s] in the uppermost layers of HD 189733 b's dayside atmosphere. This is the first direct detection of silicate clouds in HD 189733 b's atmosphere, and the first detection of a distinct absorption feature from silicate clouds on the day side of any hot Jupiter. We find that models including SiO$_2$[s] are preferred by $6-7\sigma$ over clear models and those with other potential cloud species. The high altitude location of these silicate particles is best explained by formation in the hottest regions of HD 189733 b's dayside atmosphere near the substellar point. We additionally find that HD 189733 b's emission spectrum longward of 9 $\mu$m displays residual features not well captured by our current atmospheric models. When combined with other JWST observations of HD 189733 b's transmission and emission spectrum at shorter wavelengths, these observations will provide us with the most detailed picture to date of the atmospheric composition and cloud properties of this benchmark hot Jupiter.
