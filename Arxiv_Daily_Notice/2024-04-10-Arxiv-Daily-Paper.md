#### Planet Formation by Gas-Assisted Accretion of Small Solids
 - **Authors:** Gennaro D'Angelo, Peter Bodenheimer
 - **Subjects:** Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05906
 - **Abstract**
 We compute the accretion efficiency of small solids, with radii 1 cm $\le$ Rs $\le$ 10 m, on planets embedded in gaseous disks. Planets have masses 3 $\le$ Mp $\le$ 20 Earth masses (Me) and orbit within 10 AU of a solar-mass star. Disk thermodynamics is modeled via three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic calculations that typically resolve the planetary envelopes. Both icy and rocky solids are considered, explicitly modeling their thermodynamic evolution. Maximum efficiencies of 1 $\le$ Rs $\le$ 100 cm particles are generally $\lesssim$ 10%, whereas 10 m solids tend to accrete efficiently or be segregated beyond the planet's orbit. A simplified approach is applied to compute the accretion efficiency of small cores, with masses Mp $\le$ 1 Me and without envelopes, for which efficiencies are approximately proportional to Mp^(2/3). The mass flux of solids, estimated from unperturbed drag-induced drift velocities, provides typical accretion rates dMp/dt $\lesssim$ 1e-5 Mearth/yr. In representative disk models with an initial gas-to-dust mass ratio of 70-100 and total mass of 0.05-0.06 Msun, solids' accretion falls below 1e-6 Mearth/yr after 1-1.5 million years (Myr). The derived accretion rates, as functions of time and planet mass, are applied to formation calculations that compute dust opacity self-consistently with the delivery of solids to the envelope. Assuming dust-to-solid coagulation times of approximately 0.3 Myr and disk lifetimes of approximately 3.5 Myr, heavy-element inventories in the range 3-7 Me require that approximately 90-150 Me of solids cross the planet's orbit. The formation calculations encompass a variety of outcomes, from planets a few times the Earth mass, predominantly composed of heavy elements, to giant planets. Peak luminosities during the epoch of solids' accretion range from $\approx$ 1e-7 to $\approx$ 1e-6 times the solar luminosity.
#### Remnant masses from 1D+ core-collapse supernovae simulations: bimodal  neutron star mass distribution and black holes in the low-mass gap

 - **Abstract**
 The explosion of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is an extremely challenging problem, and there are still large uncertainties regarding which stars lead to successful explosions that leave behind a neutron star, and which ones will form a black hole instead. In this paper, we simulate 341 progenitors at three different metallicities using spherically symmetric simulations that include neutrino-driven convection via a mixing-length theory. We use these simulations to improve previously derived explosion criteria based on the density and entropy profiles of the pre-supernova progenitor. We also provide numerical fits to calculate the final mass of neutron stars based on either compactness, the location of the Si/Si-O interface, or the Chandrasekhar mass. The neutron star birth mass distribution derived from our 1D+ simulations is bimodal, contrary to what the most popular 1D CCSN simulations have shown so far. We compare the theoretically derived neutron star mass distributions with the observed ones and discuss potential implications for population synthesis studies. We also analyze the black hole mass distribution predicted by our simulations. To be consistent with current models of matter ejection in failed SNe, a large fraction of the envelope must be expelled, leading to small black holes in the low-mass gap. One black hole in this mass region has recently been observed in the GW230529 event by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. Our results naturally agree with this detection, which the most popular prescriptions for explodability and remnant masses are not able to reproduce. In general, we find that the explosion outcome and mass of the remnant strongly depend on the pre-collapse structure of the progenitor. However, their dependence on the initial mass of the star and the mass of the CO core is highly uncertain and non-linear.
#### On Variation of Light Curves and Broad Emission Lines for Periodic QSOs  from co-rotating Supermassive binary black holes in elliptical orbits

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05975
 - **Abstract**
 Context. Periodic QSOs are considered as candidates of supermassive binary black hole (BBH) systems in galactic centers. Further confirmation of these candidates may require different lines of observational evidences. Aims. Assuming the Doopler boosting scenario, in this paper we investigate the (coherent) variations of both broad emission lines (BELs) and continuum light curves for active BBH systems surrounding by a circumbinary broad line region (cBLR) and focus on their dependence on the eccentric orbital configuration. Methods. We calculate the variation of continuum light and the Doppler enhanced/weakened photoionization of each BLR cloud according to the motion of BBHs in elliptical orbits, and finally obtain the coherent variation of the continuum and BELs. Results. We find that both the amplitude and variation pattern of the continuum light curves and the evolution of the BEL profiles sensitively depend on the eccentric orbital configuration of BBH systems. If only the secondary BH is active, both the variation amplitudes of continuum light curves and BELs increase with increasing BBH inclination angles and orbital eccentricities, but decrease with increasing BBH mass ratio. If both BHs are active, the asymmetry in the ionization of BLR clouds at different areas caused by the Doppler boosting effect of the secondary BH is weakened due to that of the primary BH at the opposite direction, which leads to systematically smaller variation amplitudes of both continuum light curves and BELs than the cases with only secondary BH activated. Conclusions. The coherent variations of the BEL profiles with the continuum light for those periodic QSOs provide an important way to confirm the existence of BBHs in their center. Future joint analysis of the light curves and multi-epoch observed BEL profiles for periodic QSOs may lead to the identification of a number of BBH systems.
#### The Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time DP0.2 processing  campaign at CC-IN2P3

 - **Abstract**
 The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, currently in construction in Chile, will start performing the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) in 2025 for 10 years. Its 8.4-meter telescope will survey the southern sky in less than 4 nights in six optical bands, and repeatedly generate about 2 000 exposures per night, corresponding to a data volume of about 20 TiB every night. Three data facilities are preparing to contribute to the production of the annual data releases: the US Data Facility will process 35% of the raw data, the UK data facility will process 25% of the raw data and the French data facility, operated by CC-IN2P3, will locally process the remaining 40% of the raw data. In the context of the Data Preview 0.2 (DP0.2), the Data Release Production pipelines have been executed on the DC-2 simulated dataset (generated by the Dark Energy Science Collaboration, DESC). This dataset includes 20 000 simulated exposures, representing 300 square degrees of Rubin images with a typical depth of 5 years. DP0.2 ran at the Interim Data Facility (based on Google cloud), and the full exercise was independently replicated at CC-IN2P3. During this exercise, 3 PiB of data and more than 200 million files were produced. In this contribution we will present a detailed description of the system that we set up to perform this processing campaign using CC-IN2P3's computing and storage infrastructure. Several topics will be addressed: workflow generation and execution, batch job submission, memory and I/O requirements, etc. We will focus on the issues that arose during this campaign and how we addressed them and will present some perspectives after this exercise.
#### Dynamics of Star Cluster Formation: Mergers in Gas Rich Environments
 - **Authors:** Jeremy Karam, Alison Sills
 - **Subjects:** Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06348
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06348
 - **Abstract**
 We perform high resolution simulations of forming star clusters as they merge inside giant molecular clouds (GMCs) using hydrodynamics coupled to N-body dynamics to simultaneously model both the gas and stars. We zoom in to previously run GMC simulations and resolve clusters into their stellar and gas components while including the surrounding GMC environment. We find that GMC gas is important in facilitating the growth of clusters in their embedded phase by promoting cluster mergers. Mergers induce asymmetric expansion of the stellar component of the clusters in our simulations. As well, mergers induce angular momentum in the clusters' stellar and gas components. We find that mergers can lead to an increase in the amount of dense gas present in clusters if a background gas distribution is present. We predict that this can lead to new star formation that can change the overall distribution of cluster stars in velocity space. Our results suggest that subcluster mergers in the presence of background gas can imprint dynamical signatures that can be used to constrain cluster formation histories.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrino flavor transformation offers a window into the physics of various astrophysical environments, including our Sun and the more exotic environs of core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron-star mergers. Here, we apply an inference framework - specifically: statistical data assimilation (SDA) - to neutrino flavor evolution in the Sun. We take a model for solar neutrino flavor evolution, together with Earth-based neutrino measurements, to infer solar properties. Specifically, we ask what signature of the radially-varying solar electron number density $n_e(r)$ is contained within these Earth-based measurements. Currently, the best estimates of $n_e(r)$ come from the standard solar model. We seek to ascertain, through novel application of the SDA method, whether estimates of the same from neutrino data can serve as independent constraints.
#### Detection of Rydberg lines from the atmosphere of Betelgeuse
 - **Authors:** W. R. F. Dent, G. Harper, A. M. S. Richards, P. Kervella, L. D. Matthews

 - **Abstract**
 Emission lines from Rydberg transitions are detected for the first time from a region close to the surface of Betelgeuse. The H30${\alpha}$ line is observed at 231.905 GHz, with a FWHM ~42 km/s and extended wings. A second line at 232.025 GHz (FWHM ~21 km/s), is modeled as a combination of Rydberg transitions of abundant low First Ionization Potential metals. Both H30${\alpha}$ and the Rydberg combined line X30${\alpha}$ are fitted by Voigt profiles, and collisional broadening with electrons may be partly responsible for the Lorentzian contribution, indicating electron densities of a few 10$^8$cm$^{-3}$. X30${\alpha}$ is located in a relatively smooth ring at a projected radius of 0.9x the optical photospheric radius R$_*$, whereas H30${\alpha}$ is more clumpy, reaching a peak at ~1.4R$_*$. We use a semi-empirical thermodynamic atmospheric model of Betelgeuse to compute the 232 GHz (1.29mm) continuum and line profiles making simple assumptions. Photoionized abundant metals dominate the electron density and the predicted surface of continuum optical depth unity at 232 GHz occurs at ~1.3R$_*$, in good agreement with observations. Assuming a Saha-Boltzmann distribution for the level populations of Mg, Si, and Fe, the model predicts that the X30${\alpha}$ emission arises in a region of radially-increasing temperature and turbulence. Inclusion of ionized C and non-LTE effects could modify the integrated fluxes and location of emission. These simulations confirm the identity of the Rydberg transition lines observed towards Betelgeuse, and reveal that such diagnostics can improve future atmospheric models.
