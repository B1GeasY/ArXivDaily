 - **Abstract**
 The level of dust vertical settling and radial dust concentration in disks is of critical importance for understanding the efficiency of planet formation. We present the first uniform analysis of the vertical extent of millimeter dust for a representative sample of 33disks. We used radiative transfer modeling of archival high-angular-resolution (<=0.1") ALMA dust observations of inclined and ringed disks to estimate their vertical dust scale height, which was compared to estimated gas scale heights to characterize the level of vertical sedimentation. In all 23systems for which constraints could be obtained, we find that the outer parts of the disks are vertically settled. 5disks allow for the characterization of the dust scale height both within and outside approximately half the dust disk radius, showing a lower limit on their dust heights at smaller radii. This implies that the ratio between vertical turbulence and the Stokes number, $\alpha_z/\St$, decreases radially in these sources. For 21rings in 15disks, we also constrained the level of radial concentration of the dust, finding that about half of the rings are compatible with strong radial trapping. In most of these rings, vertical turbulence is found to be comparable to or weaker than radial turbulence, which is incompatible with the turbulence generated by the vertical shear instability at these locations. We further used our dust settling constraints to estimate the turbulence level under the assumption that the dust size is limited by fragmentation, finding typical upper limits around $\alpha_\text{frag}\leq10^{-3}$. In a few sources, we find that turbulence cannot be the main source of accretion. In the context of pebble accretion, we identify several disk regions that have upper limits on their dust concentration that would allow core formation to proceed efficiently, even at wide orbital distances outside of 50au.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Gemini/GHOST high-resolution spectra of five stars observed in two low surface brightness Milky Way satellites, Sagittarius II (Sgr2) and Aquarius II (Aqu2). For Aqu2, the velocities and metallicities of the two stars are consistent with membership in a dark matter-dominated ultra faint dwarf galaxy (UFD). The chemical abundance ratios suggest inefficient star formation from only one or a few supernovae (e.g., low Na, Sr, Ba), and enriched potassium (K) from super-AGB stars. For Sgr2, the velocity and metallicity dispersions of its members are not clearly resolved and our detailed chemical abundances show typical ratios for metal-poor stars, with low dispersions. There is only one exception - we report the discovery of an r-process enhanced star (Sgr2584, [Eu/Fe]= $+0.7 \pm 0.2 $; thus, an r-I star). As r-I stars are found in both UFDs (Tuc III, Tuc IV, Grus II) and globular clusters (M15 and M92), then this does not help to further classify the nature of Sgr2. Our exploration of Sgr2 demonstrates the difficulty in classifying some of the faintest (ambiguous) satellites. We advocate for additional diagnostics in analysing the ambiguous systems, such as exploring radial segregation (by mass and/or chemistry), N-body simulations, and the need for dark matter to survive Galactic tidal effects. The spectra analysed in this paper were taken as part of the GHOST commissioning observations, testing faint observation limits (G < 18.8) and the single and double IFU observing modes.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate neutrino transport is crucial for reliably modeling explosive astrophysical events like core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and neutron star mergers (NSMs). However, in these extremely neutrino-dense systems, flavor oscillations exhibit challenging nonlinear effects rooted in neutrino-neutrino forward scattering. Evidence is quickly accumulating that these collective phenomena can substantially affect explosion dynamics, neutrino signals, nucleosynthesis, and kilonova light curves. We review the progress made so far on the difficult and conceptually deep question of how to correctly include this physics in simulations of CCSNe and NSMs. Our aim is to take a broad view of where the problem stands, and so provide a critical assessment of where it is headed.

 - **Abstract**
 Widespread galactic winds emanate from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), with the 30 Doradus starburst region generating the fastest and most concentrated gas flows. We report on the gas distribution, kinematics, and ionization conditions of the near-side outflow along 8 down-the-barrel sightlines using UV absorption-line observations from the HST's ULLYSES program for this region along with H I 21-cm observations from the GASS and GASKAP surveys. We find that within 1.7 degrees from the center of 30 Doradus, the wind reaches maximum speeds of $100-150\,\text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ from the LMC's disk. The total integrated column densities of low-ions (O I, Si II, and Fe II) in the blueshifted wind, up to $v_{\rm LSR}=150\,\text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}$, are highest near the center and decline radially outward. We estimate an outflow mass of $M_{\rm outflow,\,Si II}\approx(5.7-8.6)\,\times 10^{5} M_{\odot}$, outflow rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm outflow}\gtrsim0.02 M_{\odot}\,\text{yr}^{-1}$, and mass loading factor of $\eta\gtrsim0.10$ within 0.52 degrees from the center of 30 Doradus. The observed ion ratios$-$together with photoionization modeling$-$reveal that this wind is roughly $40-97\%$ photoionized. The metallicities and dust depletion patterns of the high-velocity absorbers at $v_{\rm LSR}\approx+120\,\text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ can be explained by either a foreground Milky Way (MW) halo cloud or an outflow from the LMC. For the high-ions, Si IV and C IV are broader and kinematically offset from the low-ions, suggesting turbulent mixing layers (TMLs) existing in the wind. Finally, our hydrodynamical simulations of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) and MW system suggest that the Magellanic Corona can protect the LMC winds from the ram-pressure forces exerted by the MW's halo.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a novel mechanism for angular momentum (AM) exchange between the crust and core of a neutron star (NS) via the gyromagnetic effect. Using extended hydrodynamics, we model the star by incorporating macroscopic AM and microscopic AM originating from neutron orbital and spin AM. We reveal that macroscopic dynamics in the crust can inform microscopic AM in the core leading to neutron spin polarization, and offer alternative scenario of (anti-)glitches. This work highlights the overlooked multi-scale AM interconversions in NS physics, paving the way for gyromagnetic astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 We present for the first time an analysis of high-frequency gravitational wave (GW) emission from proto-neutron stars (PNS) in core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) that combines spatial decomposition and modal decomposition to both source and characterize the emission. Our analysis is based on three-dimensional CCSN simulations initiated from two progenitors with differing mass and metallicity. We spatially decompose GW strains into five regions and show they are initially largest in the PNS surface layers from accretion and later largest from the Ledoux convective and convective overshoot regions within the PNS. We compute the fractional GW luminosity and observe that the majority of the luminosity moves from the same outer layers to deep within the PNS at comparable times. Using a self-consistent perturbative analysis, we investigate the evolution of the oscillation modes of the PNS. We find that the frequency of the evolving high-frequency component of the GW signal is well matched to the ${}^2g_2$-mode, the ${}^2g_1$-mode, and the ${}^2f$-mode over time. We show that the ${}^2g$-modes emit most of their power in GWs initially from the PNS surface region, but within a few 100 ms after bounce, it is the convective overshoot region of the PNS that emits the most GW power for the ${}^2g_1$-mode. Eventually, the ${}^2f$-mode is the dominant mode producing GWs, and they are emitted primarily from the convective overshoot region. Thus, with three interconnected analyses, we show that, while the GW emission is global, stemming from multiple regions in and around the PNS, we are able to source the dominant contributions to it. We find that high-frequency GW emission from the PNS in CCSNe is more complex than assessed by other methods, and dependent, first emitted mainly by ${}^2g$-modes driven by accretion onto the PNS and later emitted by the ${}^2f$-mode driven by sustained Ledoux convection.

 Stars form from dense cores in turbulent molecular clouds. According to the standard scenario of star formation, dense cores are created by cloud fragmentation. However, the physical mechanisms driving this process are still not fully understood from an observational standpoint. However, the physical mechanisms driving this process are still not fully understood from an observational standpoint. Our goal is to investigate the process of cloud fragmentation using observational data from nearby clouds. Specifically, we aim to examine the role of self-gravity and turbulence, both of which are key to the dynamical evolution of clouds. We applied astrodendro to the Herschel H2 column density maps to identify dense cores and determine their mass and separation in two nearby low-mass clouds: the Polaris Flare and Lupus I clouds. We then compared the observed core masses and separations with predictions from models of gravitational and turbulent fragmentation. For turbulent fragmentation, the key scales are the cloud sonic scale and its corresponding mass. The average core masses are estimated to be 0.242 Msun for Lupus I and 0.276 Msun for the Polaris Flare. The core separations peak at 0.1 - 0.2 pc in both clouds. These separations are significantly smaller than the Jeans length but agree well with the cloud sonic scale. Additionally, the density probability distribution functions of the dense cores follow log-normal distributions, which is consistent with the predictions of turbulent fragmentation. These findings suggest that the primary process driving core formation in the observed low-mass star-forming regions is not gravitational fragmentation but rather turbulent fragmentation. We found no evidence that filament fragmentation plays a significant role in the formation of dense cores.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Acetone (CH3COCH3) is a carbonyl-bearing complex organic molecule, yet interstellar observations of acetone remain limited. Studying the formation and distribution of CH3COCH3 in the interstellar medium can provide valuable insights into prebiotic chemistry and the evolution of interstellar molecules. Aims. We explore the spatial distribution of CH3COCH3 and its correlation with the O-bearing molecules acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) and methanol (CH3OH), as well as the N-bearing molecule ethyl cyanide (C2H5CN), in massive protostellar clumps. Methods. We observed 11 massive protostellar clumps using ALMA at 345 GHz, with an angular resolution of 0.7''-1.0''. Spectral line transitions were identified using the eXtended CASA Line Analysis Software Suite. We constructed integrated intensity maps of CH3COCH3, CH3CHO, CH3OH, and C2H5CN and derived their rotation temperatures, column densities, and abundances under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium. Results. CH3COCH3 is detected in 16 line-rich cores from 9 massive protostellar clumps: 12 high-mass cores, 3 intermediate-mass cores, and 1 low-mass core. CH3CHO and CH3OH are also detected in all 16 cores, while C2H5CN is detected in 15. The integrated intensity maps reveal similar spatial distributions for CH3COCH3, CH3CHO, CH3OH, and C2H5CN. The line emission peaks of all four molecules coincide with the continuum emission peaks in regions without ultracompact HII regions. Significant correlations are observed in the abundances of these molecules, which also exhibit similar average temperatures. Conclusions. Our observational results, supported by chemical models, suggest that CH3COCH3, CH3CHO, and CH3OH originate from the same gas. The observed temperatures and abundances of CH3COCH3 are consistent with model predictions involving grain surface chemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot cores, as a stage of massive star formation, exhibit abundant line emissions of COMs. We present a deep line survey of two isomers of C$_2$H$_6$O: ethanol (C$_2$H$_5$OH; EA), and dimethyl ether (CH$_3$OCH$_3$; DE) as well as their possible precursor CH$_3$OH towards 60 hot cores by using the ALMA 3 mm line observations. EA is detected in 40 hot cores and DE is detected in 59 hot cores. Of these, EA and DE are simultaneously detected in 39 hot cores. We calculate rotation temperatures and column densities of EA and DE by using the XCLASS software. The average rotation temperature of EA is higher than that of DE, whereas the average column density of EA is lower than that of DE. Combined with previous studies of hot cores and hot corinos, we find strong column density correlations among EA and DE ($\rho$ = 0.92), EA and CH$_3$OH ($\rho$ = 0.82), as well as DE and CH$_3$OH ($\rho$ = 0.80). The column density ratios of EA/DE versus the column densities of CH$_3$OH remain nearly constant with values within ~ 1 order of magnitude. These strong correlations and the stable ratios, suggest that EA, DE, and CH$_3$OH could be chemically linked, with CH$_3$OH potentially serving as a precursor for EA and DE. Compared with chemical models, the three different warm-up timescale models result in the systematic overproduction of EA and the systematic underproduction of DE. Therefore, our large sample observations can provide crucial constraints on chemical models.
#### X-ray and radio data obtained by XMM-Newton and VLA constrain the stellar wind of the magnetic quasi-Wolf-Rayet star in HD45166

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, a powerful magnetic field was discovered in the hot helium star classified as a quasi-Wolf-Rayet star of ~2Msun, member of the HD45166 system. Upon its explosion as a core-collapse supernova, it is expected to produce a strongly magnetic neutron star, a magnetar. Among the key parameters governing the pre-supernova evolution is the amount of mass lost via stellar wind. However, the magnetic nature of this helium star is expected to affect its stellar wind making the estimation of the wind parameters uncertain. We report the first observations of HD45166 in X-rays with the XMM-Newton telescope and in radio with the VLA interferometer array. By placing the observation results in a theoretical framework, we aim to provide a reliable estimate of the wind strength of the magnetic qWR star. The X-ray properties are explained in the framework of the MCWS scenario, and the semi-analytic XADM model is applied to reproduce the X-ray emission. The thermal radio emission of the wind and its absorption effect on possible gyro-synchrotron emission from the underlying dipolar magnetosphere, sampled in 3D, are computed by integrating the radiative transfer equation. We did not detect radio emissions, this enabled us to set sensitive upper limits on the radio luminosity. The magnetic qWR star is a slow rotator, comparison with models reveals that the possible acceleration mechanisms occurring within its dynamical magnetosphere are not as efficient as in fast-rotating magnetic ApBp-type stars. In contrast, the system is detected in X-rays with log(L_X/L_bol)~ -5.6. Using suitable models, we constrain the mass lost from this magnetic quasi-Wolf-Rayet star as dot{M}~3e-10 Msun/yr. This novel empirical estimate of the mass-loss rate in a ~2Msun helium star confirms that it maintains super-Chandrasekhar mass till collapse and can produce a magnetar as its final evolutionary product.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Several new phenomena have been surrounding the area of study of the repeating thermonuclear explosions called novae. For example, recurrent novae have been proven to be efficient cosmic ray hadronic accelerators thanks to the recent observations of RS Ophiuchi by different gamma-ray instruments. Novae have also demonstrated to have the ability to carve large cavities into the Interstellar Medium with parallelisms with the remnants of supernovae. We aim at calculating what is the effect of novae in their surrounding media and to which distances these effects dominate over the average quantities that are measured in the ISM. We calculate the filling factor of novae and their contribution to cosmic ray fluxes using cosmic ray propagation codes. To limit what is the atomic density of the Interstellar Medium (ISM) surrounding the region around RS Oph, we use Fermi-LAT observations of the region. The filling factor of novae in the Galaxy is not significant under all assumptions done in the paper. They do not dominate over the local cosmic ray fluxes, even at the lowest energies, for distances larger than a few parsec. The particle density of the ISM surrounding them is, however, very much modified, lowering it more than one order of magnitude with respect to galactic averages, confirming estimates done using other observatories. As a conclusion, even though at global galactic distances, novae do not seem to be dominating cosmic ray transport, they have the power to modify the conditions of their surrounding ISM over parsec distances.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents the first comprehensive Bayesian inference of neutron star matter, incorporating $\Delta$-resonances alongside hyperons and nucleons within a density-dependent relativistic hadron (DDRH) framework. Using constraints from nuclear saturation properties, chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT), NICER radius measurements, and tidal deformability data from GW170817, we systematically explore the impact of $\Delta$-resonances on the equation of state (EoS) of dense matter and neutron star observables. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of $\Delta$-baryons softens the EoS at low densities while maintaining sufficient stiffness at high densities to support $2M_{\odot}$ neutron stars. This naturally reconciles neutron star radius constraints with the recent observation of the low-mass compact object in HESS J1731-347 while simultaneously exhibiting excellent agreement with GW170817 tidal deformability constraints, reinforcing the astrophysical viability of $\Delta$-admixed neutron stars. Additionally, $\Delta$-resonances are found to populate the outer layers of the neutron star core, which may have implications for neutron star mergers and their cooling. Furthermore, we show that the presence of $\Delta$-baryons might significantly influence neutron star cooling via the direct Urca process. We also investigate quasi-normal $f$-mode oscillations within a fully general relativistic framework, revealing strong correlations between the $f$-mode frequency, neutron star compactness, and tidal deformability. With the inclusion of $\Delta$-resonances and adherence to astrophysical constraints, we obtain $f_{1.4} = 1.97^{+0.17}_{-0.22}$ kHz and the damping time $\tau_{f_{1.4}} = 0.19^{+0.05}_{-0.03}$ s at the $1\sigma$ confidence level.

 - **Abstract**
 Ca {\sc i} 4227 Å\, line is a strong resonance line formed in the Solar chromosphere. At the limb, it produces the largest scattering polarization signal. So far, modeling the linear polarization in this line has been limited to the use of one-dimensional semi-empirical models of the solar atmosphere. In this paper, we use three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical models of the solar atmosphere as well as 1.5D radiative transfer to understand the formation of linear polarization profiles due to resonance scattering in this line at a near limb position. Using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical models of the solar atmosphere, in this paper, we perform 1.5D radiative transfer calculations to understand the formation of linear polarization profiles due to resonance scattering in this line at a near limb position. We focus on studying the sensitivity of the resonance scattering polarization to the temperature and the density structures in the atmosphere. We do not include the effects of magnetic and velocity fields in this study. We use clustering analysis to identify linear polarization profiles with similar shape and group them accordingly for our study. We analyze the structure of the linear polarization profiles across 14 clusters, each representing different realizations of the solar atmosphere. Using source function ratio plots at various wing and core wavelength positions, we provide a qualitative explanation of linear polarization profiles in these clusters.
#### TESS and HARPS-N unveil two planets transiting TOI-1453. A super-Earth and one of the lowest mass sub-Neptunes

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the validation and characterisation of two transiting planets around TOI-1453, a K-dwarf star in the TESS northern continuous viewing zone. In addition to the TESS data, we used ground-based photometric, spectroscopic, and high-resolution imaging follow-up observations to validate the two planets. We obtained 100 HARPS-N high-resolution spectra over two seasons and used them together with the TESS light curve to constrain the mass, radius, and orbit of each planet. TOI-1453 b is a super-Earth with an orbital period of $P_b$=4.314 days, a radius of $R_b$=1.17$\pm$0.06$R_{\oplus}$, and a mass lower than 2.32$M_{\oplus}$ (99$\%$). TOI-1453 c is a sub-Neptune with a period of $P_c$=6.589 days, radius of $R_c$=2.22$\pm$0.09$R_{\oplus}$, and mass of $M_c$=2.95$\pm$0.84$M_{\oplus}$. The two planets orbit TOI-1453 with a period ratio close to 3/2, although they are not in a mean motion resonance (MMR) state. We did not detect any transit timing variations in our attempt to further constrain the planet masses. TOI-1453 c has a very low bulk density and is one of the least massive sub-Neptunes discovered to date. It is compatible with having either a water-rich composition or a rocky core surrounded by a thick H/He atmosphere. However, we set constraints on the water mass fraction in the envelope according to either a water-rich or water-poor formation scenario. The star TOI-1453 belongs to the Galactic thin disc based on Gaia kinematics and has a sub-solar metallicity. This system is orbited by a fainter stellar companion at a projected distance of about 150 AU, classifying TOI-1453 b and c of S-type planets. These various planetary and stellar characteristics make TOI-1453 a valuable system for understanding the origin of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we examine the neutrino signals from 24 initially non-rotating, three-dimensional core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations carried to late times. We find that not only does the neutrino luminosity signal encode information about each stage of the CCSN process, but that the monotonic dependence of the luminosity peak height with compactness enables one to infer the progenitor core structure from the neutrino signal. We highlight a systematic relationship between the luminosity peak height with its timing. Additionally, we emphasize that the total energy radiated in neutrinos is monotonic with progenitor compactness, and that the mean neutrino energy contains a unique spiral SASI signature for nonexploding, BH-forming models. We also find that neutrino emissions are not isotropic and that the anisotropy increases roughly with progenitor compactness. To assess the detectability of these neutrino signal features, we provide examples of the event rates for our models for the JUNO, DUNE, SK, and IceCube detectors using the SNEWPY software, and find that many of the trends in the luminosity signal can be detectable across several detectors and oscillation models. Finally, we discuss correlations between the radiated neutrino energy and the evolution of the gravitational-wave f-mode.
