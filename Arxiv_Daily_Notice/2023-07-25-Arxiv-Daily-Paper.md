 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-massive white dwarf stars are currently being discovered at a considerable rate, thanks to surveys such as the {\it Gaia} space mission. These dense and compact stellar remnants likely play a major role in type Ia supernova explosions. It is possible to probe the interiors of ultra-massive white dwarfs through asteroseismology. In the case of the most massive white dwarfs, General Relativity could affect their structure and pulsations substantially. In this work, we present results of relativistic pulsation calculations employing relativistic ultra-massive ONe-core white dwarf models with hydrogen-rich atmospheres and masses ranging from $1.29$ to $1.369 M_{\odot}$ with the aim of assessing the impact of General Relativity on the adiabatic gravity ($g$)-mode period spectrum of very-high mass ZZ Ceti stars. Employing the relativistic Cowling approximation for the pulsation analysis, we find that the critical buoyancy (Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a) and acoustic (Lamb) frequencies are larger for the relativistic case, compared to the Newtonian case, due to the relativistic white dwarf models having smaller radii and higher gravities for a fixed stellar mass. In addition, the $g$-mode periods are shorter in the relativistic case than in the Newtonian computations, with relative differences of up to $\sim 50$ \% for the highest-mass models ($1.369 M_{\odot}$) and for effective temperatures typical of the ZZ Ceti instability strip. Hence, the effects of General Relativity on the structure, evolution, and pulsations of white dwarfs with masses larger than $\sim 1.29 M_{\odot}$ cannot be ignored in the asteroseismological analysis of ultra-massive ZZ Ceti stars.

 - **Abstract**
 When cool clouds are ram-pressure accelerated by a hot supersonic galactic wind, some of the clouds may be shredded by hydrodynamical instabilities and incorporated into the hot flow. Recent one-dimensional steady-state calculations show how cool cloud entrainment directly affects the bulk thermodynamics, kinematics, and observational characteristics of the hot gas. In particular, mass-loading decelerates the hot flow and changes its entropy. Here, we investigate the stability of planar and spherical mass-loaded hot supersonic flows using both perturbation analysis and three-dimensional time-dependent radiative hydrodynamical simulations. We show that mass-loading is stable over a broad range of parameters and that the 1D time-steady analytic solutions exactly reproduce the 3D time-dependent calculations, provided that the flow does not decelerate sufficiently to become subsonic. For higher values of the mass-loading, the flow develops a sonic point and becomes thermally unstable, rapidly cooling and forming elongated dense cometary filaments. We explore the mass-loading parameters required to reach a sonic point and the radiative formation of these filaments. For certain approximations, we can derive simple analytic criteria. In general a mass-loading rate similar to the initial mass outflow rate is required. In this sense, the destruction of small cool clouds by a hot flow may ultimately spontaneously generate fast cool filaments, as observed in starburst superwinds. Lastly, we find that the kinematics of filaments is sensitive to the slope of the mass-loading function. Filaments move faster than the surrounding wind if mass-loading is over long distances whereas filaments move slower than their surroundings if mass-loading is abrupt.
#### Frequencies analysis of the hybrid delta Sct-gamma Dor star  CoRoT-102314644

 - **Abstract**
 Observations from space missions have allowed significant progress in many scientific domains due to the absence of atmospheric noise contributions and having uninterrupted data sets. In the context of asteroseismology, this has been extremely beneficial because many oscillation frequencies with small amplitudes, not observable from the ground, can be detected. One example of this success is the large number of hybrid delta Sct-gamma Dor stars discovered. These stars have radial and non-radial p- and g-modes simultaneously excited to an observable level allowing us to probe both the external and near-to-core layers of the star. We analyse the light curve of hybrid delta Sct-gamma Dor star CoRoT ID 102314644 and characterise its frequency spectrum. We detected 29 gamma Dor type frequencies in the range [0.32-3.66] cycles per day (c/d) and a series of 6 equidistant periods with a mean period spacing of DeltaPi=1612 s. In the delta Sct domain we found 38 frequencies in the range 8.63-24.73 c/d and a quintuplet centred on the frequency p_1=11.39 c/d and derived a possible rotational period of 3.06 d. The frequency analysis of this object suggests the presence of spots at the stellar surface, nevertheless we could not dismiss the possibility of a binary system. The initial modelling of the frequency data along with external constraints has allowed us to refine its astrophysical parameters giving a mass of approximately 1.75 solar masses, a radius of 2.48 solar radii and an age of 1241 Myr. The observed period spacing, a p-mode quintuplet, the possible rotation period and the analysis of the individual frequencies provide important input constraints for the understanding of different transport phenomena in A-F-type stars.[abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 The fragmentation of gas to form stars in molecular clouds is intrinsically linked to the turbulence within them. These internal motions are set at the birth of the cloud and may vary with galactic environment and as the cloud evolves. In this paper, we introduce a new suite of 15 high-resolution molecular cloud simulations using the moving mesh code AREPO, to investigate the role of different decaying turbulent modes (mixed, compressive and solenoidal) and Virial ratios on the evolution of a $10^4\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ molecular cloud. We find that diffuse regions maintain a strong relic of the initial turbulent mode, whereas the initial gravitational potential dominates dense regions. Solenoidal seeded models thus give rise to a diffuse cloud with filament-like morphology, and an excess of brown dwarf mass fragments. Compressive seeded models have an early onset of star-formation, cluster-like morphologies and a higher accretion rate, along with overbound clouds, compared to other simulations. Filaments identified using DisPerSE, and analyzed through a new Python toolkit we develop and make publicly available with this work called FIESTA, show no clear trend in lengths, masses and densities between initial turbulent modes. Overbound clouds, however, produce more filaments and thus have more mass in filaments. The hubs formed by converging filaments are found to favour star-formation, with surprisingly similar mass distributions independent of the number of filaments connecting the hub.
#### Giant Impact Events for Protoplanets: Energetics of Atmospheric Erosion  by Head-on Collision

 - **Abstract**
 Numerous exoplanets with masses ranging from Earth to Neptune and radii larger than Earth have been found through observations. These planets possess atmospheres that range in mass fractions from 1% to 30%, reflecting the diversity of atmospheric mass fractions. Such diversities are supposed to be caused by differences in the formation processes or evolution. Here we consider head-on giant impacts onto planets causing atmosphere losses in the later stage of their formation. We perform smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations to study the impact-induced atmosphere loss of young super-Earths with 10%-30% initial atmospheric mass fractions. We find that the kinetic energy of the escaping atmosphere is almost proportional to the sum of the kinetic impact energy and self-gravitational energy released from the merged core. We derive the relationship between the kinetic impact energy and the escaping atmosphere mass. The giant impact events for planets of comparable masses are required in the final stage of the popular scenario of rocky planet formation. We show it results in a significant loss of the atmosphere, if the impact is a head-on collision with comparable masses. This latter fact provides a constraint on the formation scenario of rocky planets with substantial atmospheres.
