 - **Abstract**
 Obtaining reliable distance estimates to gas clouds within the Milky Way is challenging in the absence of certain tracers. The kinematic distance approach has been used as an alternative, derived from the assumption of circular trajectories around the Galactic centre. Consequently, significant errors are expected in regions where gas flow deviates from purely circular motions. We aim to quantify the systematic errors that arise from the kinematic distance method in the presence of a Galactic potential that is non-axisymmetric. We investigate how these errors differ in certain regions of the Galaxy and how they relate to the underlying dynamics. We perform 2D isothermal hydrodynamical simulation of the gas disk with the moving-mesh code Arepo, adding the capability of using an external potential provided by the Agama library for galactic dynamics. We introduce a new analytic potential of the Milky Way, taking elements from existing models and adjusting parameters to match recent observational constraints. We find significant errors in the kinematic distance estimate for gas close to the Sun, along sight lines towards the Galactic centre and anti-centre, and significant deviations associated with the Galactic bar. Kinematic distance errors are low within the spiral arms as gas resides close to local potential minima and the resulting line-of-sight velocity is close to what is expected for an axisymmetric potential. Interarm regions exhibit large deviations at any given Galactic radius. This is caused by the gas being sped up or slowed down as it travels into or out of the spiral arm. We are able to define 'zones of avoidance' in the lv-diagram, where the kinematic distance method is particularly unreliable and should only be used with caution. We report a power law relation between the kinematic distance error and the deviation of the project line-of-sight velocity from circular motion.
#### Discovery of widespread non-metastable ammonia masers in the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a search for ammonia maser emission in 119 Galactic high-mass star-forming regions (HMSFRs) known to host 22 GHz H$_2$O maser emission. Our survey has led to the discovery of non-metastable NH$_3$ inversion line masers toward 14 of these sources. This doubles the number of known non-metastable ammonia masers in our Galaxy, including nine new very high excitation ($J,K$)~=~(9,6) maser sources. These maser lines, including NH$_3$ (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,8), (10,8), and (11,9), arise from energy levels of 342 K, 513 K, 465 K, 606 K, 834 K, 1090 K, 942 K, 1226 K, and 1449 K above the ground state. Additionally, we tentatively report a new metastable NH$_3$ (3,3) maser in G048.49 and an NH$_3$ (7,7) maser in G029.95. Our observations reveal that all of the newly detected NH$_3$ maser lines exhibit either blueshifted or redshifted velocities with respect to the source systemic velocities. Among the non-metastable ammonia maser lines, larger velocity distributions, offset from the source systemic velocities, are found in the ortho-NH$_3$ ($K=3n$) than in the para-NH$_3$ ($K\neq3n$) transitions.

 - **Abstract**
 Only indirect evidence of the role of magnetic braking in regulating gravitational collapse and the formation of circumstellar disks was found from observational work, such as compact disk sizes and the launching of high-velocity collimated protostellar jets. More direct tests of the magnetic braking shaping the angular momentum (AM) of the gas in Class 0 protostars are crucially needed. In the present work we have used non-ideal MHD models of protostellar collapse and synthetic observations of molecular gas spectral emission that we analyze to test whether possible kinematic signatures of the magnetic braking in the gas velocity field can be captured from maps of the molecular gas emission in protostellar envelopes. By comparing the 3D Specific AM of models with varying turbulent energy and magnetization, we show that, in the numerical models of protostellar evolution explored, the increase in magnetization and its consequences on the spatial redistribution of SAM modifies the shapes of the radial profiles of SAM. We show that widely used observational methods fail to quantitatively capture the magnitude of SAM of the gas in protostellar envelopes, and that no method allows to measure the differences in radial evolution of SAM due to different magnetization at all envelope radii. This is especially true in the more magnetized cases. However, our analysis suggests that the detection of symmetric patterns and organized velocity fields, in the moment-1 maps of the molecular line emission as well as monotonous radial profiles of the SAM showing a power-law decline, should be suggestive of a less magnetized scenario. Protostellar cores where efficient magnetic braking is at work are more likely to present a highly asymmetric velocity field, and more prone to show complex radial profiles of their specific angular momentum measured in the equatorial plane.
#### Planck data revisited: low-noise synchrotron polarisation maps from the  WMAP and Planck space missions

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of cosmic microwave background polarisation, essential for probing a potential phase of inflation in the early universe, suffer from contamination by polarised emission from the Galactic interstellar medium. This work combines existing observations from the WMAP and Planck space missions to make a low-noise map of polarised synchrotron emission that can be used to clean forthcoming CMB observations. We combine WMAP K, Ka and Q maps with Planck LFI 30~GHz and 44~GHz maps using weights that near-optimally combine the observations as a function of sky direction, angular scale, and polarisation orientation. We publish well-characterised maps of synchrotron Q and U Stokes parameters at nu = 30GHz and 1 degree angular resolution. A statistical description of uncertainties is provided with Monte-Carlo simulations of additive and multiplicative errors. Our maps are the most sensitive full-sky maps of synchrotron polarisation to date, and are made available to the scientific community on a dedicated web site.
#### Cepheids with giant companions: A new, abundant source of Cepheid  astrophysics

 - **Abstract**
 We present a progress report of our project aiming to increase the number of known Cepheids in double-lined binary (SB2) systems from six to 100 or more. This will allow us, among other goals, to accurately measure masses for a large sample of Cepheids. Currently, only six accurate Cepheid masses are available, which hinders our understanding of their physical properties and renders the Cepheid mass--luminosity relation poorly constrained. At the same time, Cepheids are widely used for essential measurements (e.g., extragalactic distances, the Hubble constant). To examine Cepheid period--luminosity relations, we selected as binary candidates Cepheids that are too bright for their periods. To date, we have confirmed 56 SB2 systems, including the detection of significant orbital motions of the components for 32. We identified systems with orbital periods up to five times shorter than the shortest reported period to date, as well as systems with mass ratios significantly different from unity (suggesting past merger events). Both features are essential to understand how multiplicity affects the formation and destruction of Cepheid progenitors and what effect this has on global Cepheid properties. We also present eight new systems composed of two Cepheids (only one such system was known before). Among confirmed SB2 Cepheids, there are also several wide-orbit systems. In the future, these may facilitate independent accurate geometric distance measurements to the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 At present, there is no doubt that relativistic jets observed in active galactic nuclei pass from highly magnetized to weakly magnetized stage, which is observed as a break in the dependence on their width $d_{\rm jet}(z)$ on the distance $z$ to the central engine. In this paper, we discuss the possibility of observing another break, which should be located at shorter distances. The position of this break can be associated with the region of formation of the dense central core near the jet axis which was predicted both analytically and numerically more than a decade ago, but has not yet received sufficient attention. In this case, the observed width should be determined by the dense core, and not by the total transverse size of the jet. The calculations carried out in this paper, which took into account both the transverse electromagnetic structure of the jet and the change in the spectrum of emitting particles along its axis, indeed showed such behaviour. We also found the evidence of the predicted break in the jet expansion profile using stacked 15 GHz VLBA image of M87 radio jet and constrain the light cylinder radius.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Fully fledged penumbrae have been widely studied both observationally and theoretically. Yet the relatively fast process of penumbra formation has not been studied closely with high spatial resolution. Aims. We investigate the stages previous to and during the formation of penumbral filaments in a developing sunspot. Methods. We analysed Milne-Eddington inversions from spectro-polarimetric data of the leading sunspot of NOAA 11024 during the development of its penumbra. We focused on selected areas of this protospot in which segments of penumbra develop. Results. We find that few types of distinctive flow patterns develop at the protospot limb and centre sides previous to penumbra formation. The flow in the centre side is often characterised by a persistent (>20 min) inflow-outflow pattern extending radially over 4 arcsec at the direct periphery of the protospot umbra. This inflow-outflow system often correlates with elongated granules, as seen in continuum intensity maps, and is also coupled with magnetic bipolar patches at its edges, as seen in magnetograms. The field is close to horizontal between the bipolar patches, which is indicative of its possible loop configuration. All of these aspects are analogous to observations of magnetic flux emergence. In the protospot limb side, however, we observed a mostly regular pattern associated with small granules located near the protospot intensity boundary. Locally, an inflow develops adjacent to an existing penumbral segment, and this inflow is correlated with a single bright penumbral filament that is brighter than filaments containing the Evershed flow. All investigated areas at the centre and limb side eventually develop penumbral filaments with an actual Evershed flow that starts at the umbral boundary and grows outwards radially as the penumbral filaments become longer in time
#### Fermi and eROSITA Bubbles as Persistent Structures of The Milky Way  Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 The Fermi and eROSITA bubbles, large diffuse structures in our Galaxy, can be the by-products of the steady star formation activity. To simultaneously explain the star formation history of the Milky Way and the metallicity of $\sim$ Z$_\odot$ at the Galactic disk, a steady Galactic wind driven by cosmic-rays is required. For tenuous gases with a density of $\lesssim$10$^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$, the cosmic-ray heating dominates over radiative cooling, and the gas can maintain the virial temperature of $\sim$0.3 keV ideal for escape from the Galactic system as the wind. A part of the wind falls back onto the disk like a galactic fountain flow. We model the wind dynamics according to the Galactic evolution scenario and find that the scale height and surface brightness of the X-ray and the hadronic gamma-ray emissions from such fountain flow region can be consistent with the observed properties of the Fermi and eROSITA bubbles. This implies that the bubbles are persistent structures of the Milky Way existing over (at least) the last $\sim$1 Gyr, rather than evanescent structures formed by non-trivial, $\sim$10 Myr past Galactic Center transient activities.
#### On the properties of free floating planets originating in circumbinary  planetary systems

 - **Abstract**
 Free-floating planets are a new class of planets recently discovered. These planets don't orbit within stellar systems, instead living a nomadic life within the galaxy. How such objects formed remains elusive. Numerous works have explored mechanisms to form such objects, but have not yet provided predictions on their distributions that could differentiate between formation mechanisms. In this work we form these objects within circumbinary systems, where these planets are readily formed and ejected through interactions with the central binary stars. We find significant differences between planets ejected through planet-planet interactions and those by the binary stars. The main differences that arise are in the distributions of excess velocity, where binary stars eject planets with faster velocities. These differences should be observable amongst known free-floating planets in nearby star-forming regions. We predict that targeted observations of directly imaged free-floating planets in these regions should be able to determine their preferred formation pathway, either by planet formation in single or multiple stellar systems, or through processes akin to star formation. Additionally the mass distributions of free-floating planets can yield important insights into the underlying planet populations. We find that for planets more massive than 20 $\rm M_{\oplus}$, their frequencies are similar to those planets remaining bound and orbiting near the central binaries. This similarity allows for effective and informative comparisons between mass distributions from microlensing surveys, to those of transit and radial velocities. Ultimately, by observing the velocity dispersion and mass distribution of free-floating planets, it will be possible to effectively compare with predictions from planet formation models, and to further understand the formation and evolution of these exotic worlds.
#### Long gamma-ray burst light curves as the result of a common stochastic  pulse-avalanche process

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The complexity and variety exhibited by the light curves of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) enclose a wealth of information that still awaits being fully deciphered. Despite the tremendous advance in the knowledge of the energetics, structure, and composition of the relativistic jet that results from the core collapse of the progenitor star, the nature of the inner engine, how it powers the relativistic outflow, and the dissipation mechanisms remain open issues. Aims. A promising way to gain insights is describing GRB light curves as the result of a common stochastic process. In the Burst And Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) era, a stochastic pulse avalanche model was proposed and tested through the comparison of ensemble-average properties of simulated and real light curves. Here we aim to revive and further test this model. Methods. We apply it to two independent data sets, BATSE and Swift/BAT, through a machine learning approach: the model parameters are optimised using a genetic algorithm. Results. The average properties are successfully reproduced. Notwithstanding the different populations and passbands of both data sets, the corresponding optimal parameters are interestingly similar. In particular, for both sets the dynamics appears to be close to a critical state, which is key to reproduce the observed variety of time profiles. Conclusions. Our results propel the avalanche character in a critical regime as a key trait of the energy release in GRB engines, which underpins some kind of instability.
#### The relative prevalence of wave-packets and coherent structures in the  inertial and kinetic ranges of turbulence as seen by Solar Orbiter

 - **Abstract**
 The Solar Orbiter (SO) mission provides the opportunity to study the evolution of solar wind turbulence. We use SO observations of nine extended intervals of homogeneous turbulence to determine when turbulent magnetic field fluctuations may be characterized as: (i) wave-packets and (ii) coherent structures (CS). We perform the first systematic scale-by-scale decomposition of the magnetic field using two wavelets known to resolve wave-packets and discontinuities, the Daubechies 10 (Db10) and Haar respectively. The probability distributions (pdfs) of turbulent fluctuations on small scales exhibit stretched tails, becoming Gaussian at the outer scale of the cascade. Using quantile-quantile plots, we directly compare the wavelet fluctuations pdfs, revealing three distinct regimes of behaviour. Deep within the inertial range (IR) both decompositions give essentially the same fluctuation pdfs. Deep within the kinetic range (KR) the pdfs are distinct as the Haar wavelet fluctuations have larger variance and more extended tails. On intermediate scales, spanning the IR-KR break, the pdf is composed of two populations: a core of common functional form containing $\sim97\%$ of fluctuations, and tails which are more extended for Haar fluctuations than Db10 fluctuations. This establishes a crossover between wave-packet (core) and CS (tail) phenomenology in the IR and KR respectively. The range of scales where the pdfs are $2$-component is narrow at $0.9$ au ($4-16$ s) and broader ($0.5-8$ s) at $0.4$ au. As CS and wave-wave interactions are both candidates to mediate the turbulent cascade, these results offer new insights into the distinct physics of the IR and KR.
