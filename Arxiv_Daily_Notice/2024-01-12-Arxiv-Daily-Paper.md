#### Investigating Thermal Contrasts Between Jupiter's Belts, Zones, and  Polar Vortices with VLT/VISIR

 - **Abstract**
 Using images at multiple mid-infrared wavelengths, acquired in May 2018 using the VISIR instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT), we study Jupiter's pole-to-pole thermal, chemical and aerosol structure in the troposphere and stratosphere. We confirm that the pattern of cool and cloudy anticyclonic zones and warm cloud-free cyclonic belts persists throughout the mid-latitudes, up to the polar boundaries, and evidence a strong correlation with the vertical maximum windshear and the locations of Jupiter's zonal jets. At high latitudes, VISIR images reveal a large region of mid-infrared cooling poleward $\sim$64$^{\circ}$N and $\sim$67$^{\circ}$S extending from the upper troposphere to the stratosphere, co-located with the reflective aerosols observed by JunoCam, and suggesting that aerosols play a key role in the radiative cooling at the poles. Comparison of zonal-mean thermal properties and high-resolution visible imaging from Juno allows us to study the variability of atmospheric properties as a function of altitude and jet boundaries, particularly in the cold southern polar vortex. However, the southern stratospheric polar vortex is partly masked by a warm mid-infrared signature of the aurora. Co-located with the southern main auroral oval, this warming results from the auroral precipitation and/or joule heating which heat the atmosphere and thus cause a significant stratospheric emission. This high emission results from a large enhancement of both ethane and acetylene in the polar region, reinforcing the evidence of enhanced ion-related chemistry in Jupiter's auroral regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic electron density model NE2001 describes the multicomponent ionized structure of the Milky Way interstellar medium. NE2001 forward models the dispersion and scattering of compact radio sources, including pulsars, fast radio bursts, AGNs, and masers, and the model is routinely used to predict the distances of radio sources lacking independent distance measures. Here we present the open-source package NE2001p, a fully Python implementation of NE2001. The model parameters are identical to NE2001 but the computational architecture is optimized for Python, yielding small (<1%) numerical differences between NE2001p and the Fortran code. NE2001p can be used on the command-line and through Python scripts available on PyPI. Future package releases will include modular extensions aimed at providing short-term improvements to model accuracy, including a modified thick disk scale height and additional clumps and voids. This implementation of NE2001 is a springboard to a next-generation Galactic electron density model now in development.
#### Atmospheric properties of AF Lep b with forward modeling

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We aim to expand the atmospheric exploration of AF Lep b by modeling all available observations obtained with SPHERE at VLT (between 0.95-1.65, at 2.105, and 2.253 $\mu$m, and NIRC2 at Keck (at 3.8 $\mu$m) with self-consistent atmospheric models. Methods. To understand the physical properties of this exoplanet, we used ForMoSA. This forward-modeling code compares observations with grids of pre-computed synthetic atmospheric spectra using Bayesian inference methods. We used Exo-REM, an atmospheric radiative-convective equilibrium model, including the effects of non-equilibrium processes and clouds. Results. From the atmospheric modeling we derive solutions at a low effective temperature of ~750 K. Our analysis also favors a metal-rich atmosphere (>0.4) and solar to super-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio (~0.6). We tested the robustness of the estimated values for each parameter by cross-validating our models using the leave-one-out strategy, where all points are used iteratively as validation points. Our results indicate that the photometry point at 3.8 $\mu$m strongly drives the metal-rich and super-solar carbon-to-oxygen solutions. Conclusions. Our atmospheric forward-modeling analysis strongly supports the planetary nature of AF Lep b. Its spectral energy distribution is consistent with that of a young, cold, early-T super-Jovian planet. We recover physically consistent solutions for the surface gravity and radius, which allows us to reconcile atmospheric forward modeling with evolutionary models, in agreement with the previously published complementary analysis done by retrievals. Finally, we identified that future data at longer wavelengths are mandatory before concluding about the metal-rich nature of AF Lep b.
#### Dark matter decay in the Milky Way halo

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter may be detected in X-ray decay, including from the decay of the dark matter particles that make up the Milky Way (MW) halo. We use a range of density profiles to compute X-ray line intensity profiles, with a focus on the resonantly produced sterile neutrino dark matter candidate. Compared to the Navarro--Frenk--White density profile, we show that using an adiabatically contracted halo profile suppresses the line intensity in the halo outskirts and enhances it in the Galactic Centre (GC), although this enhancement is eliminated by the likely presence of a core within 3~kpc. Comparing our results to MW halo observations, other X-ray observations, and structure formation constraints implies a sterile neutrino mixing angle parameter $s_{11}\equiv\sin^{2}(2\theta)\times10^{11}\sim[3,4]$ (particle lifetime $\tau_{28}\equiv\tau/(10^{28}\mathrm{sec})\sim[1.0,1.3]$), which is nevertheless is strong tension with some reported non-detections. We make predictions for the likely decay flux that the XRISM satellite would measure in the GC, plus the Virgo and Perseus clusters, and outline further steps to determine whether the dark matter is indeed resonantly produced sterile neutrinos as detected in X-ray decay.
#### $Spitzer$-selected $z > 1.3$ protocluster candidates in the LSST Deep  Drilling Fields

 - **Abstract**
 We have identified 189 candidate $z > 1.3$ protoclusters and clusters in the LSST Deep Drilling Fields. This sample will enable the measurement of the metal enrichment and star formation history of clusters during their early assembly period through the direct measurement of the rate of supernovae identified through the LSST. The protocluster sample was selected from galaxy overdensities in a $Spitzer$/IRAC colour-selected sample using criteria that were optimised for protocluster purity using a realistic lightcone. Our tests reveal that $60-80\%$ of the identified candidates are likely to be genuine protoclusters or clusters, which is corroborated by a $\sim4\sigma$ stacked X-ray signal from these structures. We provide photometric redshift estimates for 47 candidates which exhibit strong peaks in the photo-$z$ distribution of their candidate members. However, the lack of a photo-$z$ peak does not mean a candidate is not genuine, since we find a stacked X-ray signal of similar significance from both the candidates that exhibit photo-$z$ peaks and those that do not. Tests on the lightcone reveal that our pursuit of a pure sample of protoclusters results in that sample being highly incomplete ($\sim4\%$) and heavily biased towards larger, richer, more massive, and more centrally concentrated protoclusters than the total protocluster population. Most ($\sim75\%$) of the selected protoclusters are likely to have a maximum collapsed halo mass of between $10^{13}-10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$, with only $\sim25\%$ likely to be collapsed clusters above $10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$. However, the aforementioned bias ensures our sample is $\sim50\%$ complete for structures that have already collapsed into clusters more massive than $10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$.
#### Effect of nuclear reactions rates and core boundary mixing on the  seismology of red clump stars

 - **Abstract**
 Modeling of the stars in the red clump (RC) is challenging, due to the uncertainties associated with the physical processes happening in their core and during the helium flash. By probing the internal stellar structure, asteroseismology allows us to constrain the core properties of RC stars and eventually improve our understanding of this evolutionary phase. In this work, we aim to quantify the impact on the seismic properties of the RC stars of the two main core modeling uncertainties: core boundary mixing, and helium burning nuclear reaction rates. Using the MESA stellar evolution code, we compute models with different core boundary mixing as well as different $3\alpha$ and carbon alpha (C-alpha) nuclear reaction rates. We investigate the impact of those parameters on the period spacing $\Delta \Pi$, which is a probe of the region around the core. We find that different core boundary mixing schemes yield significantly different period spacings, with differences of 30s between the maximal $\Delta \Pi$ value computed with semiconvection and maximal overshoot. We show that increasing the rate of the C-alpha reaction lengthens the core helium burning phase, which extends the range of $\Delta \Pi$ covered by the models during their evolution. This results in a difference of 10s between the models computed with a nominal rate and a rate multiplied by 2, which is larger than the observational uncertainties. The effect of changing the 3$\alpha$ reaction rate is comparatively small. In conclusion, the core boundary mixing is the main source of uncertainty regarding the seismic modeling of RC stars. Moreover, the effect of the C-alpha reaction rate is non-negligible, even if difficult to disentangle from the effect of the mixing. Such degeneracy could be raised in the future, thanks to new seismic data from the PLATO mission and theoretical constraints from numerical simulations.
#### Angular momentum transport near convective-core boundaries of Gamma  Doradus stars

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05543
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05543
 - **Abstract**
 Recent asteroseismic studies have revealed that the convective core of $\gamma$ Doradus stars rotates faster than their radiative interior. We study the development of differential rotation near the convective core to test angular momentum transport processes that are typically adopted in stellar evolution models. Models that only include the advection of angular momentum by meridional circulation and shear instabilities cannot reproduce current rotational constraints, irrespective of the initial conditions. The latest formulation of internal magnetic fields based on the Tayler instability is indeed able to reproduce the internal rotation rate of post-main sequence stars, however, it appears too efficient during the main sequence and has thus been disfavoured. A less efficient version of the same transport process can simultaneously reproduce the rotation rate of the convective core, the rotation rate in radiative regions as probed by gravity-modes, and the surface rotational velocities of $\gamma$ Doradus stars. Our work suggests that there are additional physical processes apart from internal magnetic fields at work in the stellar interiors of post-main sequence stars.
#### Free-floating "planets'' in the macrolensed quasar Q2237+0305

 - **Abstract**
 It has been claimed that the variability of field quasars resembles gravitational lensing by a large cosmological population of free-floating planets with mass of about 10 Earths. But Galactic photometric monitoring experiments, on the other hand, exclude a large population of such planetary-mass gravitational lenses. These apparently contradictory pieces of evidence can be reconciled if the objects under consideration have a mean column-density that lies between the critical column-densities for gravitational lensing in these two contexts. Dark matter in that form is known to be weakly collisional, so that a core develops in galaxy halo density profiles, and a preferred model has already been established. Here we consider what such a model implies for Q2237+0305, which is the best-studied example of a quasar that is strongly lensed by an intervening galaxy. We construct microlensing magnification maps appropriate to the four macro-images of the quasar -- all of which are seen through the bulge of the galaxy. Each of these maps exhibits a caustic network arising from the stars, plus many small, isolated caustics arising from the free-floating "planets" in the lens galaxy. The "planets" have little influence on the magnification histograms but a large effect on the statistics of the magnification gradients. We compare our predictions to the published OGLE photometry of Q2237+0305 and find that these data are consistent with the presence of the hypothetical "planets". However, the evidence is relatively weak because the OGLE dataset is not well suited to testing our predictions and requires low-pass filtering for this application. New data from a large, space-based telescope are desirable to address this issue.
#### Galactic-Seismology Substructures and Streams Hunter with LAMOST and  Gaia. I. Methodology and Local Halo Results

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel, deep-learning based method -- dubbed Galactic-Seismology Substructures and Streams Hunter, or GS$^{3}$ Hunter for short, to search for substructures and streams in stellar kinematics data. GS$^{3}$ Hunter relies on a combined application of Siamese Neural Networks to transform the phase space information and the K-means algorithm for the clustering. As a validation test, we apply GS$^{3}$ Hunter to a subset of the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) cosmological simulations. The stellar streams and substructures thus identified are in good agreement with corresponding results reported earlier by the FIRE team. In the same vein, we apply our method to a subset of local halo stars from the Gaia Early Data Release 3 and GALAH DR3 datasets, and recover several, previously known dynamical groups, such as Thamnos 1+2, Hot Thick Disk, ED-1, L-RL3, Helmi 1+2, and Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, Sequoia, VRM, Cronus, Nereus. Finally, we apply our method without fine-tuning to a subset of K-giant stars located in the inner halo region, obtained from the LAMOST Data Release 5 (DR5) dataset. We recover three, previously known structures (Sagittarius, Hercules-Aquila Cloud, and the Virgo Overdensity), but we also discover a number of new substructures. We anticipate that GS$^{3}$ Hunter will become a useful tool for the community dedicated to the search of stellar streams and structures in the Milky Way (MW) and the Local group, thus helping advance our understanding of the stellar inner and outer halos, and of the assembly and tidal stripping history in and around the MW.
#### New candidate hypervelocity red clump stars in the inner Galactic bulge

 - **Abstract**
 We search for high-velocity stars in the inner region of the Galactic bulge using a selected sample of red clump stars. Some of those stars might be considered hypervelocity stars (HVSs). Even though the HVSs ejection relies on an interaction with the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the centre of the Galaxy, there are no confirmed detections of HVSs in the inner region of our Galaxy. With the detection of HVSs, ejection mechanism models can be constrained by exploring the stellar dynamics in the Galactic centre through a recent stellar interaction with the SMBH. Based on a previously developed methodology by our group, we searched with a sample of preliminary data from version 2 of the Vista Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) Infrared Astrometric Catalogue (VIRAC2) and Gaia DR3 data, including accurate optical and NIR proper motions. This search resulted in a sample of 46 stars with transverse velocities larger than the local escape velocity within the Galactic bulge, of which 4 are prime candidate HVSs with high-proper motions consistent with being ejections from the Galactic centre. Adding to that, we studied a sample of reddened stars without a Gaia DR3 counterpart and found 481 stars with transverse velocities larger than the local escape velocity, from which 65 stars have proper motions pointing out of the Galactic centre and are candidate HVSs. In total, we found 69 candidate HVSs pointing away from the Galactic centre with transverse velocities larger than the local escape velocity.

 - **Abstract**
 We present low-frequency radio observations of the Galactic symbiotic recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi during its 2021 outburst. The observations were carried out with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) spanning a frequency range of 0.15$-$1.4 GHz during 23$-$287 days post the outburst. The average value of the optically thin spectral index is $\alpha \sim$ $-$0.4 ($F_{\nu} \propto \nu^\alpha$), indicating a non-thermal origin of the radio emission at the observed frequencies. The radio light curves are best represented by shock-driven synchrotron emission, initially absorbed by a clumpy ionized circumbinary medium. We estimate the mass-loss rate of the red giant companion star to be $\dot{M} \sim$ 7.5 $\times$ 10$^{-8}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for an assumed stellar wind velocity of 20 km/s. The 0.15--1.4 GHz radio light curves of the 2021 outburst are systematically brighter than those of the 2006 outburst. Considering similar shock properties between the two outbursts, this is indicative of a relatively higher particle number density in the synchrotron emitting plasma in the current outburst.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of significant neutrino flux from the inner Galactic plane by the IceCube detector has provided us valuable insights on the spectrum of cosmic rays in our Galaxy. This flux can be produced either by a population of Galactic point sources or by diffused emission from cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar medium or by a mixture of both. In this work, we compute diffused gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes produced by a population of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in our Galaxy, assuming different parametrizations of the Galactic diffused cosmic ray distribution. In particular, we take into account two main cases: (I) constant cosmic ray luminosity in our Galaxy, and (II) space-dependent cosmic ray luminosity based on the supernovae distribution in our Galaxy. For Case-I, we found that the neutrino flux from GMCs is a factor of $\sim 10$ below compared to $\pi^0$ and KRA$_\gamma$ best-fitted models of IceCube observations at $10^5$ GeV. Instead, for Case-II the model can explain up to $\sim 90 \%$ of the neutrino flux at that energy. Moreover, for this scenario IceCube detector could be able to detect neutrino events from the Galactic centre regions. We then calculated the gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes from individual GMCs and noticed that several current and future Cherenkov telescopes and neutrino observatories have the right sensitivities to study these objects. In particular, very neutrino-bright region such as Aquila Rift is favourable for detection by the IceCube-Gen2 observatory.
#### Probing diversity of type II supernovae with the Chinese Space Station  Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 Type II supernovae (SNe II), which show abundant hydrogen in their spectra, belong to a class of SNe with diverse observed properties. It is commonly accepted that SNe II are produced by core collapse and explosion of massive stars. However, the large photometric and spectroscopic diversity of SNe II, and the mechanisms responsible for these diversities, have not been thoroughly understood. In this review, we first briefly introduce the optical characteristics and possible progenitors of each subtype of SNe II. We then highlight the role of the Chinese Space Station Telescope in future SN studies. With a deep limiting magnitude, the main survey project could detect SN IIP-like objects as distant as $z\sim 1.2$, and obtain UV-optical follow-up for peculiar transients, especially those long-lived events. With a high resolution and a large field of view, the main survey camera is powerful in linking a nearby SN with its progenitor, while the integral field spectrograph is powerful in revealing the SN environment. All this information has the potential to help enrich our understanding of supernova physics.
#### A 3D Diffusive and Advective Model of Electron Transport Applied to the  Pulsar Wind Nebula HESS J1825-137

 - **Abstract**
 HESS J1825-137 is one of the most powerful and luminous TeV gamma-ray pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), making it an excellent laboratory to study particle transportation around pulsars. We present a model of the (diffusive and advective) transport and radiative losses of electrons from the pulsar PSRJ1826-1334 powering HESSJ1825-137 using interstellar medium gas (ISM) data, soft photon fields and a spatially varying magnetic field. We find that for the characteristic age of 21 kyr, PSR J1826-1334 is unable to meet the energy requirements to match the observed X-ray and gamma-ray emission. An older age of 40 kyr, together with an electron conversion efficiency of 0.14 and advective flow of $v = 0.002c$, can reproduce the observed multi-wavelengh emission towards HESS J1825-137. A turbulent ISM with magnetic field of $B = 20\,{\mu}G$ to $60\,{\mu}G$ to the north of HESS J1825-137 (as suggested by ISM observations) is required to prevent significant gamma-ray contamination towards the northern TeV source HESS J1826-130.

 - **Abstract**
 To probe the star formation process, we present an observational investigation of the Pillar IV and an ionized knot HH 216 in the Eagle Nebula (M16). Pillar IV is known to host a Class I protostar that drives a bipolar outflow. The outflow has produced the bow shock, HH 216, which is associated with the red-shifted outflow lobe. The James Webb Space Telescope's near- and mid-infrared images (resolution $\sim$0.07 arcsec - 0.7 arcsec) reveal the protostar as a single, isolated object (below 1000 AU). The outer boundary of Pillar IV is depicted with the 3.3 $\mu$m Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission. HH 216 is traced with the 4.05 $\mu$m Br$\alpha$ and the radio continuum emission, however it is undetected with 4.693 $\mu$m H$_{2}$ emission. HH 216 seems to be associated with both thermal and non-thermal radio emissions. High-resolution images reveal entangled ionized structures (below 3000 AU) of HH 216, which appear to be located toward termination shocks. New knots in 4.693 $\mu$m H$_{2}$ emission are detected, and are mainly found on Pillar IV's northern side. This particular result supports the previously proposed episodic accretion in the powering source of HH 216. One part of the ionized jet (extent $\sim$0.16 pc) is discovered on the southern side of the driving source. Using the $^{12}$CO($J$ = 1-0), $^{12}$CO($J$ = 3-2), and $^{13}$CO($J$ = 1-0) emission, observational signposts of Cloud-Cloud Collision (or interacting clouds) toward Pillar IV are investigated. Overall, our results suggest that the interaction of molecular cloud components around 23 and 26 km s$^{-1}$ might have influenced star formation activity in Pillar IV.
