 - **Abstract**
 We present a statistical characterization of circumstellar disk orientations toward 12 protostellar multiple systems in the Perseus molecular cloud using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at Band 6 (1.3 mm) with a resolution of 25 mas (8 au). This exquisite resolution enabled us to resolve the compact inner disk structures surrounding the components of each multiple system and to determine the projected 3-D orientation of the disks (position angle and inclination) to high precision. We performed a statistical analysis on the relative alignment of disk pairs to determine whether the disks are preferentially aligned or randomly distributed. We considered three subsamples of the observations selected by the companion separations, a <100 au, a >500 au, and a < 10,000 au. We found for the compact (< 100 au) subsample, the distribution of orientation angles is best described by an underlying distribution of preferentially aligned sources (within 30deg) but does not rule out distributions with 40% misaligned sources. The wide companion (>500 au) subsample appears to be consistent with a distribution of 40%-80% preferentially aligned sources. Similarly, the full sample of systems with companions (a< 10, 000 au) is most consistent with a fractional ratio of at most 80% preferentially aligned source and rules out purely randomly aligned distributions. Thus our results imply the compact sources (<100 au) and the wide companions (>500 au) are statistically different.
#### UOCS-XII. A study of open cluster NGC 6940 using UVIT/AstroSat: cluster  properties and exotic populations

 - **Abstract**
 We study an open cluster NGC 6940 using \textit{AstroSat}/UVIT data and other archival data. This is an intermediate age cluster ($\sim$ 1 Gyr), located at about 770 pc distance, harboring several exotic populations apart from normal single and binary stars. We identify members of this cluster using a machine learning algorithm, ML-MOC and identify 492 members, including 1 blue straggler star (BSS), 2 yellow straggler stars (YSS), 11 blue lurker (BL) candidates, and 2 red clump (RC) stars. The cluster shows the effect of mass segregation, with massive stars segregated the most into the cluster, followed by the equal-mass binary members and the single low mass stars. We report the presence of an extended main-sequence turn-off (eMSTO) feature in this cluster and suggest that the age spread may be a contributing factor behind it. However, the effect of stellar rotation, and the dust absorption needs to be examined more comprehensively with a larger fraction of MSTO stars. All the sixteen sources mentioned above have a counterpart in the UVIT/F169M filter. In order to characterize them, we construct multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 14 of these objects having no nearby sources within 3". The BSS is successfully fitted with a single-component SED. We find that three BLs, two YSS, and one RC star have UV excess greater than 50$\%$ and successfully fit two-component SEDs having hot companions. The parameters derived from the SEDs imply that the hot companions of BLs and the RC star are low-mass and normal-mass white dwarfs, whereas the hot companions of YSS are likely to be subdwarf B (sdB) stars. We suggest that at least 6 out of 14 stars ($\sim$42 $\%$) are formed via mass transfer and/or merger pathways.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary evolution theory predicts that the second common envelope (CE) ejection can produce low-mass (0.32-0.36 Msun) subdwarf B (sdB) stars inside ultrashort-orbital-period binary systems, as their helium cores are ignited under nondegenerate conditions. With the orbital decay driven by gravitational-wave (GW) radiation, the minimum orbital periods of detached sdB binaries could be as short as ~20 minutes. However, only four sdB binaries with orbital periods below an hour have been reported so far, while none of them has an orbital period approaching the above theoretical limit. Here we report the discovery of a 20.5-minute-orbital-period ellipsoidal binary, TMTS J052610.43+593445.1, in which the visible star is being tidally deformed by an invisible carbon-oxygen white dwarf (WD) companion. The visible component is inferred to be an sdB star with a mass of ~0.33 Msun, approaching that of helium-ignition limit, although a He-core WD cannot be completely ruled out. In particular, the radius of this low-mass sdB star is only 0.066 Rsun, about seven Earth radii, possibly representing the most compact nondegenerate star ever known. Such a system provides a key clue to map the binary evolution scheme from the second CE ejection to the formation of AM CVn stars having a helium-star donor, and it will also serve as a crucial verification binary of space-borne GW detectors in the future.
#### Multi-wavelength analysis of the SN-associated low-luminosity GRB  171205A

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-wavelength properties of the nearby Supernova(SN)-associated low-luminosity GRB 171205A are investigated in depth to constrain its physicalan origin synthetically. The pulse width is found to be correlated with energy with a power-law index of $-0.24\pm0.07 $, which is consistent with the indices of other SN/GRBs but larger than those of long GRBs. By analyzing the overall light curve of its prompt gamma-rays and X-ray plateaus simultaneously, we infer that the early X-rays together with the gamma-rays should reflect the activities of central engine while the late X-rays may be dominated by the interaction of external shocks with circumburst material. In addition, we find that the host radio flux and offset of GRB 171205A are similar to those of other nearby low-luminosity GRBs. We adopt 9 SN/GRBs with measured offset to build a relation between peak luminosity ($L_{\gamma,p}$) and spectral lag ($\tau$) as $L_{\gamma,p}\propto\tau^{-1.91\pm0.33}$. The peak luminosity and the projected physical offset of both 12 SN/GRBs and 10 KN/GRBs are found to be moderately correlated, suggesting their different progenitors. The multi-wavelength afterglow fitted with a top-hat jet model indicates that the jet half-opening angle and the viewing angle of GRB 171205A are $\thicksim$ 34.4 and 41.8 degrees, respectively, which implies that the off-axis emissions are dominated by the peripheral cocoon rather than the jet core.
