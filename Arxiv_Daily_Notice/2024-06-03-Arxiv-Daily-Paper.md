 - **Abstract**
 Large Language Models (LLMs) are shifting how scientific research is done. It is imperative to understand how researchers interact with these models and how scientific sub-communities like astronomy might benefit from them. However, there is currently no standard for evaluating the use of LLMs in astronomy. Therefore, we present the experimental design for an evaluation study on how astronomy researchers interact with LLMs. We deploy a Slack chatbot that can answer queries from users via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG); these responses are grounded in astronomy papers from arXiv. We record and anonymize user questions and chatbot answers, user upvotes and downvotes to LLM responses, user feedback to the LLM, and retrieved documents and similarity scores with the query. Our data collection method will enable future dynamic evaluations of LLM tools for astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic filaments are the main transport channels of matter in the Megaparsec universe, and represent the most prominent structural feature in the matter and galaxy distribution. Here we describe and define the physical and dynamical nature of cosmic filaments. It is based on the realization that the complex spatial pattern and connectivity of the cosmic web are already visible in the primordial random Gaussian density field, in the spatial pattern of the primordial tidal and deformation eigenvalue field. The filaments and other structural features in the cosmic web emerging from this are multistream features and structural singularities in phase-space. The caustic skeleton formalism allows a fully analytical classification, identification, and treatment of the nonlinear cosmic web. The caustic conditions yield the mathematical specification of weblike structures in terms of the primordial deformation tensor eigenvalue and eigenvector fields, in which filaments are identified -- in 2D -- with the so-called cusp caustics. These are centered around points that are maximally stretched as a result of the tidal force field. The resulting mathematical conditions represent a complete characterization of filaments in terms of their formation history, dynamics, and orientation. We illustrate the workings of the formalism on the basis of a set of constrained $N$-body simulations of protofilament realizations. These realizations are analyzed in terms of spatial structure, density profiles, and multistream structure and compared to simpler density or potential field saddle point specifications. The presented formalism, and its 3D generalization, will facilitate the mining of the rich cosmological information contained in the observed weblike galaxy distribution, and be of key significance for the analysis of cosmological surveys such as SDSS, DESI, and Euclid.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio observations from normal pulsars indicate that the coherent radio emission is excited by curvature radiation from charge bunches. In this review we provide a systematic description of the various observational constraints on the radio emission mechanism. We have discussed the presence of highly polarized time samples where the polarization position angle follow two orthogonal well defined tracks across the profile, that closely match the rotating vector model in an identical manner. The observations also show the presence of circular polarization, with both the right and left handed circular polarization seen across the profile. Other constraints on the emission mechanism is provided by the detailed measurements of the spectral index variation across the profile window, where the central part of the profile, corresponding to the core component, has a steeper spectrum than the surrounding cones. Finally, the detailed measurements of the subpulse drifting behaviour can be explained by considering the presence of non-dipolar field on the stellar surface and the formation of the Partially screened Gap (PSG) above the polar cap region. The PSG gives rise to a non-stationary plasma flow, that has a multi-component nature, consisting of highly energetic primary particles, secondary pair plasma and iron ions discharged from the surface, with large fragmentation resulting is dense plasma clouds and lower density inter-cloud regions. The physical properties of the outflowing plasma and the observational constraints lead us to consider coherent curvature radiation as the most viable explanation for the emission mechanism in normal pulsars, where propagation effects due to adiabatic walking and refraction are largely inconsequential.
#### Enhanced formation of interstellar complex organic molecules on carbon monoxide ice

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the role of carbon monoxide ice in the chemical evolution of prestellar cores using astrochemical rate equation models. We constrain the ratios of the binding energies on CO ice and H$_{2}$O ice for a series of adsorbates deemed important in diffusive chemistry on H$_{2}$O ices. We later include these ratios in our chemical reaction network model, where the binding and diffusion energies of icy species vary as a function of the surface composition. When the surface coverage of CO increases, the model shows an enhancement of O-bearing complex organic molecules, especially those formed from the intermediate products of CO hydrogenation (e.g. HCO) and CH$_{3}$/CH$_{2}$. Because the binding energy of CH$_{3}$/CH$_{2}$ is in the right range, its diffusion rate increases significantly with CO coverage. At $T>$14 K and with less influence, enhanced diffusion of HCO also contributes to the increase of the abundances of COM. We find, however, that chemistry is not always enhanced on CO ice and that the temperature and cosmic ray ionization rate of each astronomical object is crucial for this particular chemistry, revealing a highly non-trivial behavior that needs to be addressed on a per-case basis. Our results are highly relevant in the context of interstellar ice observations with JWST.
#### Unravelling the asphericities in the explosion and multi-faceted circumstellar matter of SN 2023ixf

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed investigation of photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric observations of the Type II SN 2023ixf. The early detection of highly-ionized flash features, rapid ascent in ultraviolet flux coupled with the blueward shift in near-ultraviolet colors and temperature provides compelling evidence for a delayed shock breakout from a confined dense circumstellar matter (CSM) enveloping the progenitor star. The temporal evolution of polarization in the SN 2023ixf phase revealed three distinct peaks in polarization evolution at 1.4 d, 6.4 d, and 79.2 d, indicating an asymmetric dense CSM, an aspherical shock front and clumpiness in the low-density extended CSM, and an aspherical inner ejecta/He-core. SN 2023ixf displayed two dominant axes, one along the CSM-outer ejecta and the other along the inner ejecta/He-core, showcasing the independent origin of asymmetry in the early and late evolution. The argument for an aspherical shock front is further strengthened by the presence of a high-velocity broad absorption feature in the blue wing of the Balmer features in addition to the P-Cygni absorption post 16 d. Hydrodynamical light curve modeling indicated a progenitor mass of 10 solar mass with a radius of 470 solar radius, explosion energy of 2e51 erg, and 0.06 solar mass of 56Ni. The modeling also indicated a two-zone CSM: a confined dense CSM extending up to 5e14 cm, with a mass-loss rate of 1e-2 solar mass per year, and an extended CSM spanning from 5e14 cm to 1e16 cm with a mass-loss rate of 1e-4 solar mass per year. The early nebular phase observations display an axisymmetric line profile of [OI] and red-ward attenuation of the emission of Halpha post 125 days, marking the onset of dust formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The Classical T Tauri Star (CTTS) stage is a critical phase of the star and planet formation process. In an effort to better understand the mass accretion process, which can dictate further stellar evolution and planet formation, a multi-epoch, multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic monitoring campaign of four CTTSs (TW Hya, RU Lup, BP Tau, and GM Aur) was carried out in 2021 and 2022/2023 as part of the Outflows and Disks Around Young Stars: Synergies for the Exploration of ULYSSES Spectra (ODYSSEUS) program. Here we focus on the HST UV spectra obtained by the HST Director's Discretionary Time UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) program. Using accretion shock modeling, we find that all targets exhibit accretion variability, varying from short increases in accretion rate by up to a factor of 3 within 48 hours, to longer decreases in accretion rate by a factor of 2.5 over the course of 1 year. This is despite the generally consistent accretion morphology within each target. Additionally, we test empirical relationships between accretion rate and UV luminosity and find stark differences, showing that these relationships should not be used to estimate the accretion rate for individual target. Our work reinforces that future multi-epoch and simultaneous multi-wavelength studies are critical in our understanding of the accretion process in low-mass star formation.
#### Boil-off of red supergiants: mass loss and type II-P supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 The mass loss mechanism of red supergiant stars is not well understood, even though it has crucial consequences for their stellar evolution and the appearance of supernovae that occur upon core-collapse. We argue that outgoing shock waves launched near the photosphere can support a dense chromosphere between the star's surface and the dust formation radius at several stellar radii. We derive analytic expressions for the time-averaged density profile of the chromosphere, and we use these to estimate mass loss rates due to winds launched by radiation pressure at the dust formation radius. These mass loss rates are similar to recent observations, possibly explaining the upward kink in mass loss rates of luminous red supergiants. Our models predict that low-mass red supergiants lose less mass than commonly assumed, while high-mass red supergiants lose more. The chromospheric mass of our models is $\sim$0.01 solar masses, most of which lies within a few stellar radii. This may explain the early light curves and spectra of type-II P supernovae without requiring extreme pre-supernova mass loss. We discuss implications for stellar evolution, type II-P supernovae, SN 2023ixf, and Betelgeuse.
