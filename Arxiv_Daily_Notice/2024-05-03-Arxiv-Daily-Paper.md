 - **Abstract**
 We present ionization structures of IC 2003, a planetary nebula with [WR] central star, using a 1-D dusty photo-ionization code: \textit{"CLOUDY 17.03"}. The photo-ionization model is constrained by archival UV emission line fluxes, medium-resolution optical spectroscopy, $IRAS$ $25 \mu m$ flux, absolute $H\beta$ flux, and the mean angular size of the nearly spherical optical nebula. To constrain the carbon abundance and the effect of photo-electric heating in the ionized gas, we used UV emission lines. We considered an amorphous carbon dust grain with MRN and KMH size distributions to address the importance of photo-electric heating in the ionized nebula. We show that KMH grain size distribution with quantum dust heating reproduces the observations quite well. We construct the ionization structures of different elements at their different ionization stages in the nebula. We derive the physical properties of the planetary nebula and its chemical composition, as well as the parameters of its central star. The estimated nebular dust-to-gas mass ratio is $2.37\times 10^{-3}$, and the enhanced photo-electric heating yielded by small dust grains is $9.4\%$ of the total heating. We considered the H-poor model atmosphere for the central star; the effective temperature of the central star is 177kK, the specific gravity log(g) is 6, and its luminosity ($L_*$) is 6425 $L_\odot$. The derived central star parameters plotted on stellar evolutionary tracks correspond to a central star mass of 0.636$M_\odot $ and to a progenitor mass of 3.26$M_\odot$.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a simple fit function, $L_{\nu_i}(t) = C\, t^{-\alpha}\, e^{-(t/\tau)^{n}}$, to parametrize the luminosities of neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors during the protoneutron star (PNS) cooling phase at post-bounce times $t \gtrsim 1$ s. This fit is based on results from a set of neutrino-hydrodynamics simulations of core-collapse supernovae in spherical symmetry. The simulations were performed with an energy-dependent transport for six neutrino species and took into account the effects of convection and muons in the dense and hot PNS interior. We provide values of the fit parameters $C$, $\alpha$, $\tau$, and $n$ for different neutron star masses and equations of state as well as correlations between these fit parameters. Our functional description is useful for analytic supernova modeling, for characterizing the neutrino light curves in large underground neutrino detectors, and as a tool to extract information from measured signals on the mass and equation of state of the PNS and on secondary signal components on top of the PNS's neutrino emission.
#### Mass segregation and velocity dispersion as evidence for a dark star  cluster

 - **Abstract**
 A dark star cluster (DSC) is a system in which the cluster potential is dominated by stellar remnants, such as black holes and neutron stars having larger masses than the long-lived low-mass stars. Due to mass segregation, these remnants are located in the central region of the cluster and form a dark core. We expect that at a few kpc from the Galactic centre, the efficient evaporation of the lower-mass stars caused by the strong tidal force exposes the dark core, because the dynamical properties of the DSC are dominated by the remnants. Due to the invisibility of the remnants, finding a DSC by observation is challenging. In this project, we use $N$-body simulations to obtain models of DSCs and try to discern observables that signify a DSC. We consider four observables: the mass spectrum, the observational mass density profile, the observational velocity dispersion profile and the mass segregation. The models show that a DSC typically exhibits two distinct characteristics: for a given mass in stars and a given half-light radius the expected velocity dispersion is underestimated when only visible stars are considered, and there is a lack of measurable mass segregation among the stars. These properties can be helpful for finding DSCs in observational data, such as the Gaia catalogue.

 - **Abstract**
 The GAMA J0913$-$0107 system is a rare conjunction of a submillimeter galaxy (SMG) at $z \approx 2.7$ and two background QSOs with projected separations $<$200 kpc. Previous high-resolution QSO absorption-line spectroscopy has revealed high H $\tiny{\rm I}$ column density, extremely metal-poor ($\sim 1\%$ solar) gas streams in the circumgalactic medium of the SMG. Here we present deep optical integral-field spectroscopy of the system with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). Reaching a $2\sigma$ surface brightness (SB) limit $\approx 10^{-19}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ with $\sim$2 hours of integration time, we detect a filamentary Ly$\alpha$ nebula stretching $\sim$180 kpc from the SMG intercepting both QSO sightlines. This Ly$\alpha$ filament may correspond to the same cool gas stream penetrating through the hot halo seen in the absorption. In contrast to Ly$\alpha$ nebulae around QSOs, there is no obvious local source for photoionization due to the massive dust content. While uncertain, we consider the possibility that the nebula is ionized by shocks induced by the infall, obscured star formation, and/or a boosted UV background. The SMG-QSOs conjunction multiplied the efficiency of the KCWI observations, allowing a direct comparison of Ly$\alpha$ nebulae in two distinct environments. We find that the nebula around the QSOs are much brighter and show steeper surface brightness profiles than the SMG nebula. This is consistent with the additional photoionization and Ly$\alpha$ scattering provided by the QSOs. While illustrating the challenges of detecting Ly$\alpha$ nebulae around SMGs, our work also demonstrates that important insights can be gained from comparative studies of high-$z$ Ly$\alpha$ nebulae.
#### A Low Temperature Kinetic Study of the C(3P) + CH3OCH3 Reaction. Rate  constants, H-atom Product Yields and Astrochemical Implications

 - **Abstract**
 Atomic carbon in its ground electronic state, C(3P), is expected to be present at high abundances during the evolution of dense molecular clouds. Consequently, its reactions with other interstellar species could have a strong influence on the chemical composition of these regions. Here, we report the results of an investigation of the reaction between C(3P) and dimethylether, CH3OCH3, which was recently detected in dark cloud TMC-1. Experiments were performed to study the kinetics of this reaction using a continuous supersonic flow reactor employing pulsed laser photolysis and pulsed laser induced fluorescence for atomic radical generation and detection respectively. Rate constants for this process were measured between 50 K and 296 K, while additional measurements of the product atomic hydrogen yields were also performed over the 75-296 K range. To better understand the experimental results, statistical rate theory was used to calculate rate constants over the same temperature range and to provide insight on the major product channels. These simulations, based on quantum chemical calculations of the ground triplet state of the C3H6O molecule, allowed us to obtain the most important features of the underlying potential energy surface. The measured rate constant increases as the temperature falls, reaching a value of k_(C+CH_3 OCH_3 )= 7.5 x 10-11 cm3 s-1 at 50 K, while the low measured H-atom yields support the theoretical prediction that the major reaction products are CH3 + CH3 + CO. The effects of this reaction on the abundances of interstellar CH3OCH3 and related species were tested using a gas-grain dense cloud model, employing an expression for the rate constant, k(T) = alpha(T/300)^beta, with alpha = 1.27 x 10-11 and beta = -1.01. These simulations predict that the C(3P) + CH3OCH3 reaction decreases gas-phase CH3OCH3 abundances by more than an order of magnitude at early times.
#### Probing the dynamical and kinematical structures of detached shells  around AGB stars

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We aim to resolve the spatial and kinematic sub-structures in five detached-shell sources to provide detailed constraints for hydrodynamic models that describe the formation and evolution of the shells. Methods. We use observations of the 12 CO (1-0) emission towards five carbon-AGB stars with ALMA. The data have angular resolutions of 0.3 arcsec to 1arcsec and a velocity resolution of 0.3 km/s . This enables us to quantify spatial and kinematic structures in the shells. Results. The observed emission is separated into two distinct components: a more coherent, bright outer shell and a more filamentary, fainter inner shell. The kinematic information shows that the inner sub-shells move at a higher velocity relative to the outer sub-shells. The observed sub-structures confirm the predictions from hydrodynamical models. However, the models do not predict a double-shell structure, and the CO emission likely only traces the inner and outer edges of the shell, implying a lack of CO in the middle layers of the detached shell. Previous estimates of the masses and temperatures are consistent with originating mainly from the brighter subshell, but the total shell masses are likely lower limits. Conclusions. The observed spatial and kinematical splittings of the shells appear consistent with results from hydrodynamical models, provided the CO emission does not trace the H2 density distribution in the shell but rather traces the edges of the shells. It is therefore not possible to constrain the total shell mass based on the CO observations alone. Complementary observations of, e.g., CI as a dissociation product of CO would be necessary to understand the distribution of CO compared to H2.

 - **Abstract**
 Wolf-Rayet stars in close binary systems can be tidally spun up by their companions, potentially leaving behind fast-spinning highly-magnetized neutron stars, known as ``magnetars", after core collapse. These newborn magnetars can transfer rotational energy into heating and accelerating the ejecta, producing hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). In this {\em{Letter}}, we propose that the magnetar wind of the newborn magnetar could significantly evaporate its companion star, typically a main-sequence or helium star, if the binary system is not disrupted by the SN kick. The subsequent heating and acceleration of the evaporated star material along with the SN ejecta by the magnetar wind can produce a post-peak bump in the SLSN lightcurve. Our model can reproduce the primary peaks and post-peak bumps of four example observed multiband SLSN lightcurves, revealing that the mass of the evaporated material could be $\sim0.4-0.6\,M_\odot$ if the material is hydrogen-rich. We suggest that the magnetar could induce strongly enhanced evaporation from its companion star near the pericenter if the orbit of the post-SN binary is highly eccentric, ultimately generating multiple post-peak bumps in the SLSN lightcurves. This ``magnetar-star binary engine" model offers a possible explanation for the evolution of polarization, along with the origin and velocity broadening of late-time hydrogen or helium broad spectral features observed in some bumpy SLSNe. The diversity in the lightcurves and spectra of SLSNe may be attributed to the wide variety of companion stars and post-SN binary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars rotate faster, on average, than lower mass stars. Stellar rotation triggers hydrodynamical instabilities which transport angular momentum and chemical species from the core to the surface. Models of high-mass stars that include these processes predict that chemical mixing is stronger at lower metallicity. We aim to test this prediction by comparing the surface abundances of massive stars at different metallicities. We performed a spectroscopic analysis of single O stars in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) based on the ULLYSES and XshootU surveys. We determined the fundamental parameters and helium, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen surface abundances of 17 LMC and 17 SMC non-supergiant O6-9.5 stars. We complemented these determinations by literature results for additional MCs and also Galactic stars to increase the sample size and metallicity coverage. We investigated the differences in the surface chemical enrichment at different metallicities and compared them with predictions of three sets of evolutionary models. Surface abundances are consistent with CNO-cycle nucleosynthesis. The maximum surface nitrogen enrichment is stronger in MC stars than in Galactic stars. Nitrogen enrichment is also observed in stars with higher surface gravities in the SMC than in the Galaxy. This trend is predicted by models that incorporate chemical transport caused by stellar rotation. The distributions of projected rotational velocities in our samples are likely biased towards slow rotators. A metallicity dependence of surface abundances is demonstrated. The analysis of larger samples with an unbiased distribution of projected rotational velocities is required to better constrain the treatment of chemical mixing and angular momentum transport in massive single and binary stars.
#### Convection and the Core $g$-mode in Proto-Compact Stars -- A detailed  analysis

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of the dynamics of proto-compact star (PCS) convection and the core ${}^2\!g_1$-mode in core-collapse supernovae based on general relativistic 2D and 3D neutrino hydrodynamics simulations. Based on 2D simulations, we derive a mode relation for the core $g$-mode frequency in terms of PCS and equation of state parameters, and discuss its limits of accuracy. This relation may prove useful for parameter inference from future supernova gravitational wave (GW) signals if the core $g$-mode or an emission gap at the avoided crossing with the fundamental mode can be detected. The current 3D simulation does not show GW emission from the core $g$-mode due to less power in high-frequency convective motions to excite the mode, however. Analysing the dynamics of PCS convection in 3D, we find that simple scaling laws for convective velocity from mixing-length theory (MLT) do not apply. Energy and lepton number transport is instead governed by a more complex balance between neutrino fluxes and turbulent fluxes that results in roughly uniform rates of change of entropy and lepton number in the PCS convection zone. Electron fraction and enthalpy contrasts in PCS convection are not well captured by the MLT gradient approximation. We find distinctly different spectra for the turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent fluctuations in the electron fraction, which scale approximately as $l^{-1}$ without a downturn at low $l$. We suggest that the different turbulence spectrum of the electron fraction is naturally expected for a passive scalar quantity.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron stars represent unique laboratories, offering insights into the physics of supranuclear-density matter and serving as potential hosts for dark matter. This study explores the impact of dark matter cores on rapidly rotating neutron stars through the two-fluid approximation, assuming minimal interaction between baryonic matter and dark matter. The investigation employs phenomenological models for fermionic and bosonic dark matter, revealing that universal relations governing mass and radius changes due to rotation remain largely unaffected in the presence of a dark matter core. Specifically, for a 5 % dark matter mass fraction, the percent deviations in total mass ($M_{tot}$), the baryonic equatorial radius ($R_{Be}$), and polar-to-equatorial baryonic radius ratio ($R_{ratioB}$) are within 3.9 %, 1.8 %, and 1.4 %, respectively. These findings suggest that the universal relations governing neutron star shape can be utilized to infer constraints on the properties of dark matter cores even in cases where the dark matter significantly softens the neutron star's equation of state.
