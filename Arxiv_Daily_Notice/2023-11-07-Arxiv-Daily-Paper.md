#### Including Neutrino-driven Convection into the Force Explosion Condition  to Predict Explodability of Multi-dimensional Core-collapse Supernovae (FEC+)

 - **Abstract**
 Most massive stars end their lives with core collapse. However, it is not clear which explode as a Core-collapse Supernova (CCSN), leaving behind a neutron star and which collapse to black hole, aborting the explosion. One path to predict explodability without expensive multi-dimensional simulations is to develop analytic explosion conditions. These analytic explosion conditions also provide a deeper understanding of the explosion mechanism and they provide some insight as to why some simulations explode and some do not. The analytic force explosion condition (FEC) reproduces the explosion conditions of spherically symmetric CCSN simulations. In this followup manuscript, we include the dominant multi-dimensional effect that aids explosion, neutrino driven convection, into the FEC. This generalized critical condition (FEC+) is suitable for multi-dimensional simulations and has potential to accurately predict explosion conditions of two- and three-dimensional CCSN simulations. We show that adding neutrino-driven convection reduces the critical condition by $\sim 30\%$, which is consistent with previous multi-dimensional simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first compelling evidence of shock-heated molecular clouds associated with the supernova remnant (SNR) N49 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Using $^{12}$CO($J$ = 2-1, 3-2) and $^{13}$CO($J$ = 2-1) line emission data taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array, we derived the H$_2$ number density and kinetic temperature of eight $^{13}$CO-detected clouds using the large velocity gradient approximation at a resolution of 3.5$''$ (~0.8 pc at the LMC distance). The physical properties of the clouds are divided into two categories: three of them near the shock front show the highest temperatures of ~50 K with densities of ~500-700 cm$^{-3}$, while other clouds slightly distant from the SNR have moderate temperatures of ~20 K with densities of ~800-1300 cm$^{-3}$. The former clouds were heated by supernova shocks, but the latter were dominantly affected by the cosmic-ray heating. These findings are consistent with the efficient production of X-ray recombining plasma in N49 due to thermal conduction between the cold clouds and hot plasma. We also find that the gas pressure is roughly constant except for the three shock-engulfed clouds inside or on the SNR shell, suggesting that almost no clouds have evaporated within the short SNR age of ~4800 yr. This result is compatible with the shock-interaction model with dense and clumpy clouds inside a low-density wind bubble.

 - **Abstract**
 In high-energy astrophysical processes involving compact objects, such as core-collapse supernovae or binary neutron star mergers, neutrinos play an important role in the synthesis of nuclides. Neutrinos in these environments can experience collective flavor oscillations driven by neutrino-neutrino interactions, including coherent forward scattering and incoherent (collisional) effects. Recently, there has been interest in exploring potential novel behaviors in collective oscillations of neutrinos by going beyond the one-particle effective or "mean-field" treatments. Here, we seek to explore implications of collective neutrino oscillations, in the mean-field treatment and beyond, for the nucleosynthesis yields in supernova environments with different astrophysical conditions and neutrino inputs. We find that collective oscillations can impact the operation of the {\nu}p-process and r-process nucleosynthesis in supernovae. The potential impact is particularly strong in high-entropy, proton-rich conditions, where we find that neutrino interactions can nudge an initial {\nu}p process neutron rich, resulting in a unique combination of proton-rich low-mass nuclei as well as neutron-rich high-mass nuclei. We describe this neutrino-induced neutron capture process as the "{\nu}i process". In addition, nontrivial quantum correlations among neutrinos, if present significantly, could lead to different nuclide yields compared to the corresponding mean-field oscillation treatments, by virtue of modifying the evolution of the relevant one-body neutrino observables.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years the focus of exoplanet research has shifted from the mere detection to detailed characterization. Precise measurements of the masses and radii of transiting planets have shown that some low-mass planets have extended atmospheres while others are bare rocks. Hybrid atmospheres consisting of a mixture of Hydrogen and large amount of heavy elements have also been detected. A key factor in explaining this diversity of planetary atmospheres is the erosion by the X-ray and EUV-radiation (XUV) from the host-star. The evaporation through XUV-radiation has already been measured for a few exoplanets.The apparent weakness of the CaIIHK and the MgIIhk emission cores has been interpreted as evidence for the evaporation of planetary atmospheres. The interpretation is that the evaporating material from the planet forms a thick torus which absorbs the C,IIHK and the MgIIhk lines from the host star. In this contribution a new way how to prove, or disprove this hypothesis by observations is proposed. It is furthermore shown that there are enough bright targets are already known that can be observed, and more will be found with the PLATO mission.

 - **Abstract**
 Measurement of the redshifted 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen from the Cosmic Dawn (CD) and Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) promises to unveil a wealth of information about the astrophysical processes during the first billion years of evolution of the universe. The AARTFAAC Cosmic Explorer (ACE) utilises the AARTFAAC wide-field imager of LOFAR to measure the power spectrum of the intensity fluctuations of the redshifted 21-cm signal from the CD at z~18. The RFI from various sources contaminates the observed data and it is crucial to exclude the RFI-affected data in the analysis for reliable detection. In this work, we investigate the impact of non-ground-based transient RFI using cross-power spectra and cross-coherence metrics to assess the correlation of RFI over time and investigate the level of impact of transient RFI on the ACE 21-cm power spectrum estimation. We detected moving sky-based transient RFI sources that cross the field of view within a few minutes and appear to be mainly from aeroplane communication beacons at the location of the LOFAR core in the 72-75 MHz band, by inspecting filtered images. This transient RFI is mostly uncorrelated over time and is only expected to dominate over the thermal noise for an extremely deep integration time of 3000 hours or more with a hypothetical instrument that is sky temperature dominated at 75 MHz. We find no visible correlation over different k-modes in Fourier space in the presence of noise for realistic thermal noise scenarios. We conclude that the sky-based transient RFI from aeroplanes, satellites and meteorites at present does not pose a significant concern for the ACE analyses at the current level of sensitivity and after integrating over the available 500 hours of observed data. However, it is crucial to mitigate or filter such transient RFI for more sensitive experiments aiming for significantly deeper integration.

 - **Abstract**
 Shocked winds of massive stars in young stellar clusters have been proposed as possible sites in which relativistic particles are accelerated. Electrons, accelerated in such an environment, are expected to efficiently comptonize optical radiation (from massive stars) and the infra-red radiation (re-scattered by the dust within the cluster) producing GeV-TeV gamma-rays. We investigate the time dependent process of acceleration, propagation and radiation of electrons in the stellar wind of the massive star $\Theta^1$ Ori C within the Trapezium cluster. This cluster is located within the nearby Orion Nebula (M 42). We show that the gamma-ray emission expected from the Trapezium cluster is consistent with the present observations of the Orion Molecular Cloud by the Fermi-LAT telescope provided that the efficiency of energy conversion from the stellar wind to relativistic electrons is very low, i.e. $\chi < 10^{-4}$. For such low efficiencies, the gamma-ray emission from electrons accelerated in the stellar wind of $\Theta^1$ Ori C can be only barely observed by the future Cherenkov telescopes, e.g. the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).
#### A WISPR of the Venus Surface: Analysis of the Venus Nightside Thermal  Emission at Optical Wavelengths

 - **Abstract**
 Parker Solar Probe (PSP) conducted several flybys of Venus while using Venus' gravity for orbital adjustments to enable its daring passes of the Sun. During these flybys, PSP turned to image the nightside of Venus using the Wide-field Imager for Solar PRobe (WISPR) optical telescopes, which unexpectedly observed Venus' surface through its thick and cloudy atmosphere in a theorized, but until-then unobserved near-visible spectral window below 0.8 $\mu$m. We use observations taken during PSP's fourth Venus gravity assist flyby to examine the origin of the Venus nightside flux and confirm the presence of this new atmospheric window through which to observe the surface geology of Venus. The WISPR images are well explained by emission from the hot Venus surface escaping through a new atmospheric window in the optical with an overlying emission component from the atmosphere at the limb that is consistent with O$_2$ nightglow. The surface thermal emission correlates strongly with surface elevation (via temperature) and emission angle. Tessera and plains units have distinct WISPR brightness values. Controlling for elevation, Ovda Regio tessera is brighter than Thetis Regio; likewise, the volcanic plains of Sogolon Planitia are brighter than the surrounding regional plains units. WISPR brightness at 0.8 $\mu$m is predicted to be positively correlated to FeO content in minerals; thus, the brighter units may have a different starting composition, be less weathered, or have larger particle sizes.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate knowledge of the interstellar medium (ISM) at high-Galactic latitudes is crucial for future cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization experiments due to extinction, albeit being low, being a foreground larger than the anticipated signal in these regions. We develop a Bayesian model to identify a region of the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram and an associated dataset suited to constrain the single-star extinction accurately at high-Galactic latitudes. Using photometry from Gaia, 2MASS and ALLWISE, parallax from Gaia and stellar parameters derived from the Gaia low-resolution BP/RP (XP) spectra as input data, we employ nested sampling to fit the model to the data and analyse samples from the extinction posterior. Charting low variations in extinction is complex due to both systematic errors and degeneracies between extinction and other stellar parameters. The systematics can be minimised by restricting our data to a region of the HR diagram where the stellar models are most accurate. Moreover, the degeneracies can be significantly reduced by including spectroscopic estimates of the effective temperature as data. We show that underestimating the measurement error on the data is detrimental to recovering an accurate extinction distribution. We demonstrate that a full posterior solution is necessary to understand the extinction parameter and find fine variation in the ISM. However, by only using the mean extinction and a prior assumption of spatial correlation, we can produce a dust map similar to other benchmark maps.

 - **Abstract**
 The universality or non-universality of the initial mass function (IMF) has significant implications for determining star formation rates and star formation histories from photometric properties of stellar populations. We reexamine whether the IMF is deficient in high-mass stars (top-light) in the low-density environment of the outer disk of M83 and constrain the shape of the IMF therein. Using archival Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) far ultraviolet (FUV) and near ultraviolet (NUV) data and new deep OmegaCAM narrowband H$\alpha$ imaging, we constructed a catalog of FUV-selected objects in the outer disk of M83. We counted H$\alpha$-bright clusters and clusters that are blue in FUV$-$NUV in the catalog, measured the maximum flux ratio $F_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}/f_{\lambda \mathrm{FUV}}$ among the clusters, and measured the total flux ratio $\Sigma F_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}/\Sigma f_{\lambda \mathrm{FUV}}$ over the catalog. We then compared these measurements to predictions from stellar population synthesis models made with a standard Salpeter IMF, truncated IMFs, and steep IMFs. We also investigated the effect of varying the assumed internal extinction on our results. We are not able to reproduce our observations with models using the standard Salpeter IMF or the truncated IMFs. It is only when assuming an average internal extinction of $0.10 < A_{\mathrm{V}} < 0.15$ in the outer disk stellar clusters that models with steep IMFs ($\alpha > 3.1$) simultaneously reproduce the observed cluster counts, the maximum observed $F_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}/f_{\lambda \mathrm{FUV}}$, and the observed $\Sigma F_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}/\Sigma f_{\lambda \mathrm{FUV}}$. Our results support a non-universal IMF that is deficient in high-mass stars in low-density environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations suggest the presence of clouds in exoplanet atmospheres but have also shown that certain chemical species in the upper atmosphere might not be in chemical equilibrium. The goal of this work is to calculate the two main cloud formation processes, nucleation and bulk growth, consistently from a non-equilibrium gas-phase. The aim is further to explore the interaction between a kinetic gas-phase and cloud micro-physics. The cloud formation is modeled using the moment method and kinetic nucleation which are coupled to a gas-phase kinetic rate network. Specifically, the formation of cloud condensation nuclei is derived from cluster rates that include the thermochemical data of (TiO$_2$)$_N$ from N = 1 to 15. The surface growth of 9 bulk Al/Fe/Mg/O/Si/S/Ti binding materials considers the respective gas-phase species through condensation and surface reactions as derived from kinetic disequilibrium. The effect of completeness of rate networks and the time evolution of the cloud particle formation is studied for an example exoplanet HD 209458 b. A consistent, fully time-dependent cloud formation model in chemical disequilibrium with respect to nucleation, bulk growth and the gas-phase is presented and first test cases are studied. This model shows that cloud formation in exoplanet atmospheres is a fast process. This confirms previous findings that the formation of cloud particles is a local process. Tests on selected locations within the atmosphere of the gas-giant HD 209458 b show that the cloud particle number density and volume reach constant values within 1s. The complex kinetic polymer nucleation of TiO$_2$ confirms results from classical nucleation models. The surface reactions of SiO[s] and SiO$_2$[s] can create a catalytic cycle that dissociates H$_2$ to 2 H, resulting in a reduction of the CH$_4$ number densities.
#### CHEOPS observations of KELT-20 b/MASCARA-2 b: an aligned orbit and signs  of variability from a reflective dayside

 - **Abstract**
 Occultations are windows of opportunity to indirectly peek into the dayside atmosphere of exoplanets. High-precision transit events provide information on the spin-orbit alignment of exoplanets around fast-rotating hosts. We aim to precisely measure the planetary radius and geometric albedo of the ultra-hot Jupiter (UHJ) KELT-20 b as well as the system's spin-orbit alignment. We obtained optical high-precision transits and occultations of KELT-20 b using CHEOPS observations in conjunction with the simultaneous TESS observations. We interpret the occultation measurements together with archival infrared observations to measure the planetary geometric albedo and dayside temperatures. We further use the host star's gravity-darkened nature to measure the system's obliquity. We present time-averaged precise occultation depth of 82(6) ppm measured with seven CHEOPS visits and 131(+8/-7) ppm from the analysis of all available TESS photometry. Using these measurements, we precisely constrain the geometric albedo of KELT-20 b to 0.26(0.04) and the brightness temperature of the dayside hemisphere to 2566(+77/-80) K. Assuming Lambertian scattering law, we constrain the Bond albedo to 0.36(+0.04/-0.05) along with a minimal heat transfer to the nightside. Furthermore, using five transit observations we provide stricter constraints of 3.9(1.1) degrees on the sky-projected obliquity of the system. The aligned orbit of KELT-20 b is in contrast to previous CHEOPS studies that have found strongly inclined orbits for planets orbiting other A-type stars. KELT-20 b's comparably high planetary geometric albedo corroborates a known trend of strongly irradiated planets being more reflective. Finally, we tentatively detect signs of temporal variability in the occultation depths, which might indicate variable cloud cover advecting onto the planetary dayside.
#### CO mapping of Cygnus-X -- volume density distribution

 - **Abstract**
 We present CO(2-1) and $^{13}$CO(2-1) maps of the Cygnus-X molecular cloud complex using the 10m Heinrich Hertz Submillimeter Telescope (SMT). The maps cover the southern portion of the complex which is strongly impacted by the feedback from the Cygnus OB2 association. Combining CO(1-0) and $^{13}$CO(1-0) maps from the Nobeyama 45m Cygnus-X CO Survey, we carry out a multi-transition molecular line analysis with RADEX and derive the volume density of velocity-coherent gas components. We select those components with a column density in the power-law tail part of the column density probability distribution function (N-PDF) and assemble their volume density into a volume density PDF ($\rho$-PDF). The $\rho$-PDF exhibits a power-law shape in the range of 10$^{4.5}$ cm$^{-3}$ $\lesssim n_{\rm H_2} \lesssim$ 10$^{5.5}$ cm$^{-3}$ with a fitted slope of $\alpha = -1.12 \pm 0.05$. The slope is shallower than what is predicted by simulations of rotationally supported structures or those undergoing gravitational collapse. Applying the same analysis to synthetic observations with feedback may help identify the cause of the shallow slope. The $\rho$-PDF provides another useful benchmark for testing models of molecular cloud formation and evolution.
