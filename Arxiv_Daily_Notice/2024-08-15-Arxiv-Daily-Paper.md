 - **Abstract**
 The radial velocity catalog from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) is unique in its simultaneously large volume and high precision as a result of its decade-long survey duration, multiplexing (600 fibers), and spectral resolution of $R \sim 22,500$. However, previous data reductions of APOGEE have not fully realized the potential radial velocity (RV) precision of the instrument. Here we present an RV catalog based on a new reduction of all 2.6 million visits of APOGEE DR17 and validate it against improved estimates for the theoretical RV performance. The core ideas of the new reduction are the simultaneous modeling of all components in the spectra, rather than a separate subtraction of point estimates for the sky, and a marginalization over stellar types, rather than a grid search for an optimum. We show that this catalog, when restricted to RVs measured with the same fiber, achieves noise-limited precision down to 30 m/s and delivers well-calibrated uncertainties. We also introduce a general method for calibrating fiber-to-fiber constant RV offsets and demonstrate its importance for high RV precision work in multi-fiber spectrographs. After calibration, we achieve 47 m/s RV precision on the combined catalog with RVs measured with different fibers. This degradation in precision relative to measurements with only a single fiber suggests that refining line spread function models should be a focus in SDSS-V to improve the fiber-unified RV catalog.

 - **Abstract**
 Distribution functions of collisionless systems are known to show non-thermal power law tails. Interestingly, collisionless plasmas in various physical scenarios, (e.g., the ion population of the solar wind) feature a $v^{-5}$ tail in the velocity ($v$) distribution, whose origin has been a long-standing mystery. We show this power law tail to be a natural outcome of the self-consistent collisionless relaxation of driven electrostatic plasmas. We perform a quasilinear analysis of the perturbed Vlasov-Poisson equations to show that the coarse-grained mean distribution function (DF), $f_0$, follows a quasilinear diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient $D(v)$ that depends on $v$ through the plasma dielectric constant. If the plasma is isotropically forced on scales much larger than the Debye length with a white noise-like electric field, then $D(v)\sim v^4$ for $\sigma<v<\omega_{\mathrm{P}}/k$, with $\sigma$ the thermal velocity, $\omega_{\mathrm{P}}$ the plasma frequency and $k$ the maximum wavenumber of the perturbation; the corresponding $f_0$, in the quasi-steady state, develops a $v^{-\left(d+2\right)}$ tail in $d$ dimensions ($v^{-5}$ tail in 3D), while the energy ($E$) distribution develops an $E^{-2}$ tail irrespective of the dimensionality of space. Any redness of the noise only alters the scaling in the high $v$ end. Non-resonant particles moving slower than the phase-velocity of the plasma waves ($\omega_{\mathrm{P}}/k$) experience a Debye-screened electric field, and significantly less (power law suppressed) acceleration than the near-resonant particles. Thus, a Maxwellian DF develops a power law tail. The Maxwellian core ($v<\sigma$) eventually also heats up, but over a much longer timescale than that over which the tail forms. We definitively show that self-consistency (ignored in test-particle treatments) is crucial for the development of the universal $v^{-5}$ tail.
#### Toward a Comprehensive Grid of Cepheid Models with MESA I. Uncertainties of the Evolutionary Tracks of Intermediate-Mass Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Helium-burning stars, in particular Cepheids, are especially difficult to model, as the choice of free parameters can greatly impact the shape of the blue loops - the part of the evolutionary track at which instability strip is crossed. Contemporary one-dimensional stellar evolution codes, like MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics), come with a large number of free parameters that allow to model the physical processes in stellar interiors under many assumptions. The uncertainties that arise from this freedom are rarely discussed in the literature despite their impact on the evolution of the model. We calculate a grid of evolutionary models with MESA, varying several controls, like solar mixture of heavy elements, mixing length theory prescription, nuclear reaction rates, scheme to determine convective boundaries, atmosphere model, temporal and spatial resolution, and quantify their impact on age and location of the evolutionary track on the HR diagram from the main sequence till the end of core-helium burning. Our investigation was conducted for a full range of masses and metallicities expected for classical Cepheids. The uncertainties are significant, especially during core-helium burning, reaching or exceeding the observational uncertainties of log Teff and log L for detached eclipsing binary systems. For models below 9 solar masses, thin convective shells develop and evolve erratically, not allowing the models to converge. A careful inspection of Kippenhahn diagrams and convergence study is advised for a given mass and metallicity, to assess how severe this problem is and to what extent it may affect the evolution.
#### SCOTCH Search for Clandestine Optically Thick Compact HII regions II

 - **Abstract**
 In this study we present 18 to 24 GHz and high angular resolution radio wavelength Australia Telescope Compact Array follow up observations towards a sample of 39 HC HII region candidates. These objects, taken from a sample hosting 6.7 GHz methanol masers, were chosen due to the compact and optically thick nature of their continuum emission. We have detected 27 compact radio sources and constructed their spectral energy distributions over the 5 to 24 GHz range to determine the young HII regions physical properties, i.e., diameter, electron density ne, emission measure, Lyman continuum flux NLy and turnover frequency. The flux measurements are fitted for 20 objects assuming an ionisation bounded HII region with uniform density model. For the remaining 7 objects that lack constraints spanning both their optically thick and thin regimes, we utilise relations from the literature to determine their physical properties. Comparing these determined parameters with those of known hypercompact and ultracompact HII regions, we have identified 13 HC HII regions, 6 intermediate objects that fall between HC HII and UC HII regions, 6 UC HII regions and one radio jet candidate which increases the known population of HC HII regions by 50 per cent. All the young and compact HII regions are embedded in dusty and dense clumps and 80 percent of the HC HII regions identified in this work are associated with various maser species. Four of our radio sources remain optically thick at 24 GHz, we consider these to be amongst the youngest HC HII regions.
#### The physical mechanism of the streaming instability

 - **Abstract**
 The main hurdle of planet formation theory is the metre-scale barrier. One of the most promising ways to overcome it is via the streaming instability (SI). Unfortunately, the mechanism responsible for the onset of this instability remains mysterious. It has recently been shown that the SI is a Resonant Drag Instability (RDI) involving inertial waves. We build on this insight and clarify the physical picture of how the SI develops, while bolstering this picture with transparent mathematics. Like all RDIs, the SI is built on a feedback loop: in the `forward action', an inertial wave concentrates dust into clumps; in the `backward reaction', those drifting dust clumps excite an inertial wave. Each process breaks into two mechanisms, a fast one and a slow one. At resonance, each forward mechanism can couple with a backward mechanism to close a feedback loop. Unfortunately, the fast-fast loop is stable, so the SI uses the fast-slow and slow-fast loops. Despite this last layer of complexity, we hope that our explanation will help understand how the SI works, in which conditions it can grow, how it manifests itself, and how it saturates.
#### Properties of sunspot light bridges on a geometric height scale

 - **Abstract**
 Investigating light bridges (LBs) helps us comprehend key aspects of sunspots. However, few studies have analyzed the properties of LBs in terms of the geometric height, which is a more realistic perspective given the corrugation of the solar atmosphere. We aim to shed light on LBs by studying the variation in their physical properties with geometric height. We used the SICON code to infer the physical quantities in terms of the optical depth and the Wilson depression values of three LBs hosted by a sunspot observed with Hinode/SP in the Fe I 630 nm pair lines. We also used SIR inversions to cross-check the height variation of the field inclination in the LBs. In both output sets, we performed linear interpolation to convert the physical parameters from optical depth into a geometric height scale in each pixel. We classified each LB as filamentary, grainy, or umbral. They appear as ridges that reach different maximum heights, with the umbral LB being the deepest. While the filamentary LB hosts a plasma inflow from the penumbra, the results for the grainy LB are compatible with an injection of hot plasma through convective cells of reduced field strength. Only a few positions reveal hints suggesting a cusp-like magnetic canopy. Moreover, strong gradients in the magnetic field strength and inclination usually exhibit enhanced electric currents, with the filamentary LB having remarkably strong currents that appear to be related to chromospheric events. The height stratification in filamentary and grainy LBs differ, indicating diverse mechanisms at work. Our results are in general incompatible with a magnetic canopy scenario, and further analysis is needed to confirm whether it exists along the entire LB or only at specific locations. Furthermore, this work assesses the usefulness of SICON when determining the height stratification of solar structures.
