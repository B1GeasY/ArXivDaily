 - **Abstract**
 Large spectroscopic surveys of individual massive stars, such as ULLYSES and XSHOOTU, provide observational data for hundreds of massive stars. Their analysis requires large numbers of synthetic spectra so that stellar parameters can be determined. In addition, libraries of massive stars' spectra are needed to produce population synthesis models able to reproduce the observed spectra of unresolved young stellar populations, such as those revealed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the early Universe. Our main goal is to provide an extensive library of synthetic spectra and spectral energy distributions of OB stars at metallicities of the Magellanic Clouds. This library will offer a wealth of spectrophotometric information, making it readily applicable to a variety of astrophysical problems. We used the CMFGEN code to calculate 606 NLTE, line-blanketed, expanding atmosphere models using a comprehensive set of atomic data. An overall metallicity of 1/2 Z$_\odot$ and 1/5 Z$_\odot$ was adopted for the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), respectively. We produced high-resolution spectra from 30 angstroms to 3 $\mu$m for stars on the Main Sequence and slightly beyond. We provide spectral energy distributions, normalized synthetic spectra, ionizing fluxes, and photometry in various bands: Johnson UBV, Cousins RI, Bessel JHK, selected wide JWST filters, Gaia, and LSST ugrizy filters. For each of these filters, we compute bolometric corrections for all synthetic spectra and calibrations as a function of effective temperature. All of our synthetic spectra are publicly available through the POLLUX database, aiming to expedite multiwavelength analyses of massive stars in low metallicity environments.

 - **Abstract**
 It is now well established that galactic systems are inherently multiphase, and that understanding the roles and interactions of the various phases is key towards a more complete picture of galaxy formation and evolution. For example, these interactions play a pivotal role in the cycling of baryons which fuels star formation. It remains a challenge that the transport and dynamics of cold clouds in their surrounding hot environment are governed by complex small scale processes (such as the interplay of turbulence and radiative cooling) that determine how the phases exchange mass, momentum and energy. Large scale models thus require subgrid prescriptions in the form of models validated on small scale simulations, which can take the form of a system of coupled differential equations. In this work, we explore using neural ordinary differential equations which embed a neural network as a term in the subgrid model to capture an uncertain physical process. We then apply Symbolic Regression on the learned model to potentially discover new insights into the physics of cloud-environment interactions. We test this on both generated mock data and actual simulation data. We also extend the neural ODE to include a secondary neural term. We show that neural ODEs in tandem with Symbolic Regression can be used to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of subgrid models, and/or discover the underlying equations to improve generality and scientific understanding. We highlight the potential of this scientific machine learning approach as a natural extension to the traditional modelling paradigm, both for the development of semi-analytic models and for physically interpretable equation discovery in complex non-linear systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We provide a detailed comparison between the ``gravoturbulent'' (GT) and ``global hierarchical collapse'' (GHC) models for molecular clouds and star formation, their respective interpretations of the observational data, the features they share, and suggested tests and observations to discern between them. Also, we clarify common misconceptions in recent literature about the global and hierarchical nature of the GHC scenario, and briefly discuss the evolution of some aspects of both models toward convergence. GT assumes that molecular clouds and their substructures are in approximate virial equilibrium and are in a near-stationary state, interprets the linewidth-derived nonthermal motions exclusively as turbulence, which provides additional pressure against self-gravity. Conversely, GHC assumes that most star-forming molecular clouds and their substructures are part of a continuous gravitationally-driven flow, each accreting from their parent structure. Thus, the clouds and their star formation rate evolve in time. GHC interprets nonthermal motions as a mixture of infall and turbulent components, with the relative importance of the former increasing as the objects become denser and/or more massive. Tests that may provide clues to distinguishing between GT and GHC must take into account that the innermost parts of globally gravitationally bound structures may not locally appear bound, and thus the binding may have to be searched for at the largest scale of the structure.

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring the strength of three dimensional (3D) magnetic field vector is challenging as it is not easy to recognize whether its line-of-sight (LOS) and plane-of-sky (POS) components are obtained from the same region. CN ($N = 1 - 0$) emission has been used to get the LOS component of a magnetic field (B$_\mathrm{LOS}$) from its Zeeman splitting lines, while dust continuum emission has been used to get the POS component of a magnetic field (B$_\mathrm{POS}$). We use the CN ($N = 1 - 0$) data observed with the Taeduk Radio Astronomy Observatory (TRAO) 14-m telescope and the dust continuum data from $Herschel$ archive toward six high-mass star-forming regions in order to test whether CN line and dust continuum emission can trace a similar region and thus can be used for inferring 3D magnetic field strength. Our comparison between CN and H$_2$ column densities for all targets indicates that CN line emission tends to be strong toward bright continuum regions. The positions of peak CN column densities are particularly well correlated with those of peak H$_2$ column densities at least over the H$_2$ column density of 8.0 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ within one or two telescope beam size in all targets, implying that CN line and dust continuum emitting regions are likely spatially coincident. This enabled us to make the reliable measurement of 3D magnetic field strengths of five targets by taking a vector sum of their B$_\mathrm{LOS}$ and B$_\mathrm{POS}$, helping to decide the magnetical criticality of the targets as supercritical or transcritical.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observational constraints on the internal structure of Jupiter and Saturn suggest that these planets have ``fuzzy" cores, i.e., radial gradients of the concentration of heavy elements that might span $50\%$ to $70\%$ of each planet's radius. These cores could be composed of a semi-convective staircase, i.e., multiple convective layers separated by diffusive interfaces arising from double-diffusive instabilities. However, to date, no study has demonstrated how such staircases can avoid layer mergers and persist over evolutionary time scales. In fact, previous work has found that these mergers occur rapidly, quickly leading to only a single convective layer. Using 3D simulations of convective staircases in non-rotating and rotating flows, we demonstrate that rotation prolongs the lifetime of a convective staircase by increasing the timescale for both layer merger and erosion of the interface between the final two layers. We present an analytic model for the erosion phase, predicting that rotation increases the erosion time by a factor of approximately $\mathrm{Ro}^{-1/2}$, where $\mathrm{Ro}$ is the Rossby number of the convective flows (the ratio of the rotation period to the convective turnover time). For Jovian conditions at early times after formation (when convection is vigorous enough to mix a large fraction of the planet), we find the erosion time to be roughly $10^{9}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the non-rotating case and $10^{11}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the rotating case. Thus, the current existence of convective staircases within the deep interiors of giant planets is a strong possibility, and rotation could be an important factor in the preservation of their fuzzy cores.
#### Giant Hall Waves Launched by Superconducting Phase Transition in Pulsars

 - **Abstract**
 The cores of pulsars are expected to become superconducting soon after birth. The transition to type-II superconductivity is associated with the bunching of magnetic field lines into discrete superconducting flux tubes which possess enormous tension. The coupling of the crust to the flux tubes implies the existence of huge tangential magnetic fields at the crust-core interface. We show that the transition to superconductivity triggers a highly non-linear response in the Hall drift of the crustal magnetic field, an effect which was neglected in previous numerical modelling. We argue that at the time of the phase transition giant Hall waves are launched from the crust-core interface toward the surface. Our models show that if the crust contains a multipolar magnetic field $\sim 10^{13}$ G, the amplitude of the Hall waves is $\sim 10^{15}$ G. The elastic deformation of the lattice is included in our models, which allows us to track the time-dependent shear stresses everywhere in the crust. The simulations indicate that the Hall waves may be strong enough to break the crust, and could cause star quakes which trigger rotation glitches and changes in the radio pulse profile. The Hall waves also couple to slow magnetospheric changes which cause anomalous braking indices. The emission of the giant Hall waves from the crust-core interface facilitates fast flux expulsion from the superconducting core, provided that the flux tubes in the core are themselves sufficiently mobile. For all of the flux tube mobility prescriptions implemented in this work, the core approaches the Meissner state with B=0 at late times.
#### Fate of the remnant in tidal stripping event: repeating and non-repeating

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDE) occur when a star ventures too close to a massive black hole. In a partial TDE (pTDE), the star only grazes the tidal radius, causing the outer envelope of the star to be stripped away while the stellar core survives. Previous research has shown that a star, once tidally stripped in a parabolic orbit, can acquire enough orbital energy for its remnant to become a high-velocity star potentially capable of escaping the galaxy. Conversely, some studies have reported that the remnant may lose orbital energy and undergo re-disruption, leading to a recurring pTDE. This study aims to uncover the physical mechanisms and determine the conditions that lead to these divergent outcomes. We find that the orbital energy change only depends on the impact factor and the stellar structure, and barely depends on the mass of the black hole or the exact mass or orbital eccentricity of the star. For a $\gamma=5/3$ (or $\gamma=4/3$) polytropic star, after a pTDE its remnant gains orbital energy when the impact factor $\beta \gtrsim 0.62$ (or $\gtrsim 1.1$) or loses energy vice versa. Additionally, we verify an analytical equation for orbital energy change that is applicable across various systems. Through hydrodynamic simulations, we also explore the structure of the stellar remnant post-tidal stripping. Our findings provide critical insights for interpreting observed pTDEs and advancing knowledge on the orbital evolution and event rate of these events.
#### Local two-dimensional simulations of the ignition of a helium shell detonation on a white dwarf by an impacting stream

 - **Abstract**
 The double detonation model is one of the prevalent explosion mechanisms of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) wherein an outer helium shell detonation triggers a core detonation in the white dwarf (WD). The dynamically driven double degenerate double detonation (D6) is the double detonation of the more massive WD in a binary WD system where the localized impact of the mass transfer stream from the companion sets off the initial helium shell detonation. To have high numerical resolution and control over the stream parameters, we have implemented a study of the local interaction of the stream with the WD surface in 2D. In cases with lower base density of the shell, the stream's impact can cause surface detonation soon after first impact. With higher base densities, after the stream hits the surface, hot material flows around the star and interacts with the incoming stream to produce a denser and narrower impact. Our results therefore show that (1) a directly impacting stream for both a relatively high resolution and for a range of stream parameters can produce a surface detonation, (2) thinner helium shells ignite more promptly via impact, doing so sooner, and (3) there are lower limits on ignition in both shell density and incoming stream speed with lower limits on density being well below those shown by other work to be required for normal appearing SN Ia. This supports stream ignition and therefore the D6 scenario, as a viable mechanism for normal SNe Ia.
#### Identifying jittering-jet-shaped ejecta in the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant

 - **Abstract**
 Analyzing images of the Cygnus Loop, a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant, in different emission bands, we identify a point-symmetrical morphology composed of three symmetry axes that we attribute to shaping by three pairs of jets. The main jet axis has an elongated S shape, appearing as a faint narrow zone in visible and UV. We term it the S-shaped hose, and the structure of three symmetry lines, the point-symmetric wind rose. The two other lines connect a protrusion (an ear or a bulge) with a hole on the opposite side of the center (a nozzle or a cavity), structures that we identify in the X-ray, UV, visible, IR, and/or radio images. There is a well-known blowout at the southern end of the S-shaped hose, and we identify a possible opposite blowout at the northern end of the S-shaped hose. The point-symmetrical morphology of the Cygnus Loop is according to the expectation of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of CCSNe, where several to few tens of pairs of jets with stochastically varying directions explode the star. The three pairs of jets that shaped the wind-rose structure of the Cygnus Loop are the last energetic pairs of this series of jets. Our study further supports the JJEM as the main explosion mechanism of CCSNe.
#### Hubble Tension or Distance Ladder Crisis?

 - **Abstract**
 We present an up-to-date compilation of published Hubble constant ($H_0$) measurements that are independent of the CMB sound horizon scale. This compilation is categorized into two distinct groups: A. Distance Ladder Measurements: This group comprises 19 recent measurements, primarily from the past four years, utilizing various rung 2 calibrators and rung 3 cosmic distance indicators. B.One-Step Measurements: This category includes 31 measurements of $H_0$ that are independent of both the CMB sound horizon scale and the distance ladder approach. These are derived from diverse probes such as Cosmic Chronometers, gamma-ray attenuation, time-delay strong lensing, megamasers etc. Statistical analysis reveals a significant distinction between these two groups. The distance ladder-based measurements yield a weighted mean $H_0 = 72.76 \pm 0.50$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, while the one-step measurements result in a weighted mean $H_0 = 69.01 \pm 0.49$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. To quantify the statistical significance of this difference, we implemented a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, which yielded a p-value of 0.000102. This extremely low p-value strongly indicates that the two samples are fundamentally distinct, with a probability of less than 0.01\% that they are drawn from the same underlying distribution. These findings suggest that late-time one-step measurements of $H_0$ are more consistent with early-time measurements, indicating that the core of the Hubble tension lies not between early-time and late-time measurements per se, but specifically between distance ladder measurements and all other $H_0$ determinations. This discrepancy points to either a systematic effect influencing all distance ladder measurements or a fundamental physics anomaly affecting at least one rung of the distance ladder.
