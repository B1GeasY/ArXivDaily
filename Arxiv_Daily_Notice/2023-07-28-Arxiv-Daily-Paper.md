 - **Abstract**
 The presence of aerosols is intimately linked to the global energy budget and composition of planet atmospheres. Their ability to reflect incoming light prevents energy from being deposited into the atmosphere, and they shape spectra of exoplanets. We observed one near-infrared secondary eclipse of WASP-80b with the Wide Field Camera 3 aboard the Hubble Space Telescope to provide constraints on the presence and properties of atmospheric aerosols. We detect a broadband eclipse depth of $34\pm10$ ppm for WASP-80b, making this the lowest equilibrium temperature planet for which a secondary eclipse has been detected so far with WFC3. We detect a higher planetary flux than expected from thermal emission alone at $1.6\sigma$ that hints toward the presence of reflecting aerosols on this planet's dayside. We paired the WFC3 data with Spitzer data and explored multiple atmospheric models with and without aerosols to interpret this spectrum. Albeit consistent with a clear dayside atmosphere, we found a slight preference for near-solar metallicities and for dayside clouds over hazes. We exclude soot haze formation rates higher than $10^{-10.7}$ g cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and tholin formation rates higher than $10^{-12.0}$ g cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ at $3\sigma$. We applied the same atmospheric models to a previously published WFC3/Spitzer transmission spectrum for this planet and find weak haze formation. A single soot haze formation rate best fits both the dayside and the transmission spectra simultaneously. However, we emphasize that no models provide satisfactory fits in terms of chi-square of both spectra simultaneously, indicating longitudinal dissimilarity in the atmosphere's aerosol composition.
#### On the origin of outward migration of Population III stars

 - **Abstract**
 Outward migration of massive binary stars or black holes in their circumbinary disc is often observed in simulations and it is key to the formation of wide black hole binaries. Using numerical simulations of Population III (Pop III) star formation, we study the angular momentum of Pop III binaries and the torques between stars and gas discs to understand the origin of outward migration and high ellipticity. The outward migration of protostars is produced by gravitational torques exerted on them by their circumstellar minidiscs. The minidiscs, on the other hand, migrate outward mainly by gaining angular momentum by accreting gas from the circumbinary disc. The angular momentum transfer is most efficient for rapidly accreting equal-mass binaries, and weaker when the secondary mass is small or the massive companion evaporates the gas disc via radiative feedback. We conclude that outward migration and the formation of wide equal-mass massive binaries is common in metal-free/metal-poor star formation, mainly driven by their large accretion rates. We expect that the lower gas temperature and accretion rates in metal-enriched circumstellar discs would lead more often to inward migration and closer binary separations. We also observe inward migration for smaller mass Pop III protostars/fragments, leading to the rapid merging of sink particles and likely the formation of close binary black holes that, however, reach separations below the resolution of our simulations. We discuss the implications that Pop III separations and ellipticity may have on the interpretation that gravitational wave signals from merging intermediate-mass black holes come from Pop III remnants.
#### Rocky sub-Neptunes formed by pebble accretion: Rain of rocks from  polluted envelopes

 - **Abstract**
 Sub-Neptune planets formed in the protoplanetary disk accreted hydrogen-helium (H,He) envelopes. Planet formation models of sub-Neptunes formed by pebble accretion result in small rocky cores surrounded by polluted H,He envelopes where most of the rock (silicate) is in vapor form at the end of the formation phase. This vapor is expected to condense and rain-out as the planet cools. In this Letter we examine the timescale for the rainout and its effect on the thermal evolution. We calculate the thermal and structural evolution of a 10 Earth masses planet formed by pebble accretion, taking into account material redistribution from silicate rainout (condensation and settling) and from convective mixing. We find that the duration of the rainout in sub-Neptunes is on Gyr timescale and varies with envelope mass: planets with envelopes below 0.75 Earth mass rainout into a core-envelope structure in less than 1 Gyr, while planets in excess of 0.75 Earth mass of H,He preserve some of their envelope pollution for billions of years. The energy released by the rainout inflates the radius with respect to planets that start out from a plain core-envelope structure. This inflation would result in estimates of the H,He contents of observed exoplanets based on the standard core-envelope structure to be too high.We identify a number of planets in the exoplanet census where rainout may operate, which would result in their H,He contents to be overestimated by up to a factor two. Future accurate age measurements by the PLATO mission may allow the identification of planets formed with polluted envelopes.
#### Observation of high-energy neutrinos from the Galactic plane

 - **Abstract**
 IceCube has discovered a flux of astrophysical neutrinos and presented evidence for the first neutrino sources, a flaring blazar known as TXS 0506+056 and the active galaxy NGC 1068. However, the sources responsible for the majority of the astrophysical neutrino flux remain elusive. In addition to hypothetical sources within our Galaxy, high energy neutrinos are produced when cosmic rays interact at their acceleration sites and during propagation through the interstellar medium. The Galactic plane has therefore long been hypothesized as a neutrino source. In this contribution, new results are presented for searches of neutrino sources utilizing a dataset that builds upon recent advances in deep-learning-based reconstruction methods for neutrino-induced cascades. This work presents the first observation of high-energy neutrinos from the Milky Way Galaxy, rejecting the background-only hypothesis at 4.5$\sigma$. The neutrino signal is consistent with diffuse emission from the Galactic plane, potentially in combination with emission by a population of sources.
#### On the survivability of a population of gas giant planets on wide orbits

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of giant planets on wide orbits ($\stackrel{>}{_\sim}100$AU) challenge planet formation theories; the core accretion scenario has difficulty in forming them, whereas the disc instability model forms an overabundance of them that is not seen observations. We perform $N$-body simulations investigating the effect of close stellar encounters ($\leq 1200$AU) on systems hosting wide-orbit giant planets and the extent at which such interactions may disrupt the initial wide-orbit planet population. We find that the effect of an interaction on the orbit of a planet is stronger for high-mass, low-velocity perturbers, as expected. We find that due to just a single encounter there is a $\sim 17%$ chance that the wide-orbit giant planet is liberated in the field, a $\sim 10$% chance it is scattered significantly outwards, and a $\sim 6$% chance it is significantly scattered inwards. Moreover, there is a $\sim 21\%$ chance that its eccentricity is excited to e>0.1, making it more prone to disruption in subsequent encounters. The results strongly suggest that the effect of even a single stellar encounter is significant in disrupting the primordial wide-orbit giant planet population; in reality the effect will be even more prominent, as in a young star-forming region more such interactions are expected to occur. We conclude that the low occurrence rate of wide-orbit planets revealed by observational surveys does not exclude the possibility that such planetary systems are initially abundant, and therefore the disc-instability model may be a plausible scenario for their formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Protostellar binaries harbour complex environment morphologies. Observations represent a snapshot in time, and projection and optical depth effects impair our ability to interpret them. Careful comparison with high-resolution models that include the larger star-forming region can help isolate the driving physical processes and give observations context in the time domain. We carry out zoom-in simulations with AU-scale resolution, and for the first time ever we follow the evolution until a circumbinary disk is formed. We investigate the gas dynamics around the young stars and extract disk sizes. Using radiative transfer, we obtain evolutionary tracers of the binary systems. We find that the centrifugal radius in prestellar cores is a poor estimator of the resulting disk size due to angular momentum transport at all scales. For binaries, the disk sizes are regulated periodically by the binary orbit, having larger radii close to the apastron. The bolometric temperature differs systematically between edge-on and face-on views and shows a high frequency time dependence correlated with the binary orbit and a low frequency time dependence with larger episodic accretion events. These oscillations can bring the system appearance to change rapidly from class 0 to class I and for short time periods even bring it to class II. The highly complex structure in early stages, as well as the binary orbit itself, affects the classical interpretation of protostellar classes and direct translation to evolutionary stages has to be done with caution and include other evolutionary indicators such as the extent of envelope material.
#### Simulated analogues II: a new methodology for non-parametric matching of  models to observations

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation is a multi-scale problem, and only global simulations that account for the connection from the molecular cloud scale gas flow to the accreting protostar can reflect the observed complexity of protostellar systems. Star-forming regions are characterised by supersonic turbulence and as a result, it is not possible to simultaneously design models that account for the larger environment and in detail reproduce observed stellar systems. Instead, the stellar inventories can be matched statistically, and best matches found that approximate specific observations. Observationally, a combination of single-dish telescopes and interferometers are now able to resolve the nearest protostellar objects on all scales from the protostellar core to the inner 10 AU. We present a new non-parametric methodology which uses high-resolution simulations and post-processing methods to match simulations and observations using deep learning. Our goal is to perform a down-selection from large data sets of synthetic images to a ranked list of best-matching candidates with respect to the observation. This is particularly useful for binary and multiple stellar systems that form in turbulent environments. The objective is to accelerate the rate at which we can do such comparisons, remove biases from hand-picking matches, and contribute to identifying the underlying physical processes that drive the creation and evolution of observed protostellar systems.
