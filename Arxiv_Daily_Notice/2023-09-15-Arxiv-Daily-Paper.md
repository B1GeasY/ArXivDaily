 - **Abstract**
 The dynamic atmosphere imposes challenges to ground-based cosmic microwave background observation, especially for measurements on large angular scales. The hydrometeors in the atmosphere, mostly in the form of clouds, scatter the ambient thermal radiation and are known to be the main linearly polarized source in the atmosphere. This scattering-induced polarization is significantly enhanced for ice clouds due to the alignment of ice crystals under gravity, which are also the most common clouds seen at the millimeter-astronomy sites at high altitudes. This work presents a multifrequency study of cloud polarization observed by the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) experiment on Cerro Toco in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile, from 2016 to 2022, at the frequency bands centered around 40, 90, 150, and 220 GHz. Using a machine-learning-assisted cloud classifier, we made connections between the transient polarized emission found in all four frequencies with the clouds imaged by monitoring cameras at the observing site. The polarization angles of the cloud events are found to be mostly $90^\circ$ from the local meridian, which is consistent with the presence of horizontally aligned ice crystals. The 90 and 150 GHz polarization data are consistent with a power law with a spectral index of $3.90\pm0.06$, while an excess/deficit of polarization amplitude is found at 40/220 GHz compared with a Rayleigh scattering spectrum. These results are consistent with Rayleigh-scattering-dominated cloud polarization, with possible effects from supercooled water absorption and/or Mie scattering from a population of large cloud particles that contribute to the 220 GHz polarization.
#### Generation of photoionized plasmas in the laboratory of relevance to  accretion-powered x-ray sources using keV line radiation

 - **Abstract**
 We describe laboratory experiments to generate x-ray photoionized plasmas of relevance to accretion-powered x-ray sources such as neutron star binaries and quasars, with significant improvements over previous work. We refer to a key quantity, the photoionization parameter, defined as xi = 4{\pi}F/n_e where F is the x-ray flux and n_e the electron density. This is usually meaningful in a steady state context, but is commonly used, in the literature, as a figure of merit for laboratory experiments that are, of necessity, time dependent. We demonstrate that we can achieve values of xi >100 erg-cm s-1 using laser-plasma x-ray sources, in the regime of interest for several astrophysical scenarios. In particular, we show that our use of a keV line source, rather than the quasi-blackbody radiation fields normally employed in such experiments, has allowed generation of a ratio of inner-shell to outer-shell photoionization expected from a blackbody source with ~keV spectral temperature. This is a key factor in allowing experiments to be compared to the predictions of codes employed to model astrophysical sources. We compare calculations from our in-house plasma modelling code with those from Cloudy and find moderately good agreement for the time evolution of both electron temperature and average ionisation. However, a comparison of code predictions of a K-beta argon X-ray spectrum with experimental data reveals that our Cloudy simulation overestimates the intensities of more highly ionised argon species. This is not totally surprising as the Cloudy model was generated for a single set of plasma conditions, while the experimental data are spatially integrated.

 - **Abstract**
 The dimmest and most numerous outlier of the Type Ia supernova population, Type Iax events, is increasingly being found in the results of observational campaigns. There is currently no single accepted model to describe these events. This 2D study explores the viability of modeling Type Iax events as a hybrid C/O/Ne white dwarf progenitor undergoing a deflagration using the multi-physics software FLASH. This hybrid was created using the stellar evolution code MESA, and its C-depleted core and mixed structure have demonstrated lower yields than traditional C/O progenitors in previous deflagration-to-detonation studies. To generate a sample, 30 "realizations" of this simulation were performed, the only difference being the shape of the initial matchhead used to start the deflagration. As consistent with earlier work, these realizations produce the familiar hot dense bound remnant surrounded by sparse ejecta. Our results indicate the majority of the star remains unburned (~70%) and bound (>90%). Our realizations produce total ejecta yields on the order of 10$^{-2}$ - 10$^{-1}$ solar masses, ejected $^{56}$Ni yields on the order of 10$^{-4}$ - 10$^{-2}$ solar masses, and ejecta kinetic energies on the order of 10$^{48}$ - 10$^{49}$ ergs. Compared to yields inferred from recent observations of the dimmest Type Iax events - SN 2007qd, SN 2008ha, SN 2010ae, SN 2019gsc, SN 2019muj, SN 2020kyg, and SN 2021fcg - our simulation produces comparable $^{56}$Ni yields, but too-small total yields and kinetic energies. Reignition of the remnant is also seen in some realizations.

 - **Abstract**
 The Tenerife Microwave Spectrometer (TMS) is a ground-based radio-spectrometer that will take absolute measurements of the sky between 10-20 GHz. To ensure the sensitivity and immunity to systematic errors of these measurements, TMS includes an internal calibration system optimised for the TMS band, and cooled down to 4 K. It consists of an Aluminium core, composed of a baseplate and a bed of pyramidal elements coated with an absorber material and a metallic shield. The absorber coating is made of a commercial resin ECCOSORB CR/MF 117. To achieve the high stability (+/- 1 mK/h), temperature homogeneity (thermal gradients {AT <= 25 mK), and emissivity (e>= 0.999) requirements of the reference unit, careful consideration has been given to the RF and thermal properties of the materials, as well as their geometry. In summary, this paper presents a comprehensive account of the design, characterisation, and test results of the TMS reference system.

 - **Abstract**
 The total mass estimate of molecular clouds suffers from the uncertainty in the H$_2$-CO conversion factor, the so-called $X_{\rm CO}$ factor, which is used to convert the $^{12}$CO (1--0) integrated intensity to the H$_2$ column density. We demonstrate the machine learning's ability to predict the H$_2$ column density from the $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O (1--0) data set of four star-forming molecular clouds; Orion A, Orion B, Aquila, and M17. When the training is performed on a subset of each cloud, the overall distribution of the predicted column density is consistent with that of the Herschel column density. The total column density predicted and observed is consistent within 10\%, suggesting that the machine learning prediction provides a reasonable total mass estimate of each cloud. However, the distribution of the column density for values $> \sim 2 \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, which corresponds to the dense gas, could not be predicted well. This indicates that molecular line observations tracing the dense gas are required for the training. We also found a significant difference between the predicted and observed column density when we created the model after training the data on different clouds. This highlights the presence of different $X_{\rm CO}$ factors between the clouds, and further training in various clouds is required to correct for these variations. We also demonstrated that this method could predict the column density toward the area not observed by Herschel if the molecular line and column density maps are available for the small portion, and the molecular line data are available for the larger areas.
#### The Mars Science Laboratory record of optical depth measurements via  solar imaging

 - **Abstract**
 The Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover has monitored the Martian environment in Gale crater since landing in 2012. This study reports the record of optical depth derived from visible and near-infrared images of the Sun. Aerosol optical depth, which is mostly due to dust but also includes ice, dominates the record, with gas optical depth too small to measure. The optical depth record includes the effects of regional dust storms and one planet-encircling dust event, showing the expected peaks during southern spring and summer and relatively lower and more stable optical depth in fall and winter. The measurements show that there is a seasonally varying diurnal change in dust load, with the optical depth peaking in the morning during southern spring and summer, correlated with thermotidal pressure changes. However, there was no systematic diurnal change during autumn and winter, except after one regional storm. There were indications that the dust was relatively enhanced at high altitudes during high-optical-depth periods and that high-altitude ice was significant during winter. The observations did not provide much information about particle size or composition, but they were consistent with a smaller particle size after aphelion (in southern winter). No scattering halos were seen in associated sky images, even when there was visual evidence of ice hazes or clouds, which suggests small or amorphous ice particles. Unexpectedly, the measurement campaign revealed that the cameras collected saltating sand in their sunshades 1.97 m above the surface. As a result, the measurement strategy had to be adjusted to avoid high-elevation imaging to avoid sand covering the optics.
#### The dusty heart of Circinus II. Scrutinizing the LM-band dust morphology  using MATISSE

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we present the first-ever $L$- and $M$-band interferometric observations of Circinus, building upon a recent $N$-band analysis. We used these observations to reconstruct images and fit Gaussian models to the $L$ and $M$ bands. Our findings reveal a thin edge-on disk whose width is marginally resolved and is the spectral continuation of the disk imaged in the $N$ band to shorter wavelengths. Additionally, we find a point-like source in the $L$ and $M$ bands that, based on the $LMN$-band spectral energy distribution fit, corresponds to the $N$-band point source. We also demonstrate that there is no trace of direct sightlines to hot dust surfaces in the circumnuclear dust structure of Circinus. By assuming the dust is present, we find that obscuration of A$_{\rm V} \gtrsim 250$ mag is necessary to reproduce the measured fluxes. Hence, the imaged disk could play the role of the obscuring "torus" in the unified scheme of active galactic nuclei. Furthermore, we explored the parameter space of the disk + hyperbolic cone radiative transfer models and identify a simple modification at the base of the cone. Adding a cluster of clumps just above the disk and inside the base of the hyperbolic cone provides a much better match to the observed temperature distribution in the central aperture. This aligns well with the radiation-driven fountain models that have recently emerged. Only the unique combination of sensitivity and spatial resolution of the VLTI allows such models to be scrutinized and constrained in detail. We plan to test the applicability of this detailed dust structure to other MATISSE-observed active galactic nuclei in the future.
#### Discerning Parallax Amplitude in Astrometric Microlensing

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational microlensing is a powerful method for discovering Isolated Stellar-Mass Black Holes(ISMBHs). These objects make long-duration microlensing events. To characterize these lensing objects by fully resolving the microlensing degeneracy, measurements of parallax and astrometric deflections are necessary. Microlensing events due to ISMBHs have considerable astrometric deflections, but small parallax amplitudes as $\pi_{\rm E} \propto 1/\sqrt{M_{\rm l}}$, where $M_{\rm l}$ is the lens mass. We numerically investigate the possibility of inferring parallax amplitude from astrometric deflection in microlensing events due to ISMBHs. The parallax amplitude in astrometric deflections is proportional to the relative parallax $\pi_{\rm{rel}}$, which means (i) does not strongly depend on $M_{\rm l}$, and (ii) increases in microlensing observations toward the Magellanic Clouds(MCs). We assume these events are potentially detected in upcoming microlensing surveys-(1): the \wfirst\ observations of the Galactic bulge (GB), and (2): the LSST observations of the Large MC(LMC)-, and the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) follows up them with one data point every ten days. We evaluate the probability of inferring parallax amplitude from these observations by calculating the Fisher/Covariance matrices. For GB, the efficiencies for discerning parallax amplitudes with a relative error $<4\%$ through astrometric, and photometric observations are $3.8\%$, and $29.1\%$, respectively. For observations toward the LMC, these efficiencies are $41.1\%$, and $23.0\%$, respectively. Measuring parallax amplitude through astrometric deflections is plausible in the GB events with the lens distance $\lesssim 2.7$kpc, and in the LMC halo-lensing. The ELT telescope by monitoring long-duration microlensing events can detect astrometric deflections, and their parallax-induced deviations.

 - **Abstract**
 eta Telescopii is a ~23 Myr old A-type star surrounded by an edge-on debris disc hypothesised to harbour gas. Recent analysis of far- and near-ultraviolet spectroscopic observations of eta Tel found absorption features at ~-23 km/s and ~-18 km/s in several atomic lines, attributed to circumstellar and interstellar gas, respectively. In this work, we put the circumstellar origin of the gas to a test by analysing high resolution optical spectroscopy of eta Tel and of three other stars with a similar line of sight as eta Tel: HD 181327, HD 180575, and rho Tel. We found absorption features at ~-23 km/s and ~-18 km/s in the Ca ii H&K lines, and at ~-23 km/s in the Na i D1&D2 doublet in eta Tel, in agreement with previous findings in the ultraviolet. However, we also found absorption features at ~-23 km/s in the Ca ii K lines of the three other stars analysed. This strongly implies that the absorption lines previously attributed to circumstellar gas are more likely due to an interstellar cloud traversing the line of sight of eta Tel instead.
#### Complete Analysis of Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves and Primordial  Non-Gaussianities $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{NL}}$

 - **Abstract**
 The investigation of primordial non-Gaussianities holds immense importance in testing the inflation paradigm and shedding light on the physics of the early universe. In this study, we conduct the first complete analysis of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) by simultaneously incorporating the local-type non-Gaussianities $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{NL}}$. To achieve this, we develop a Feynman-like diagrammatic technique and derive semi-analytic formulas for both the energy-density fraction spectrum and the angular power spectrum. For the energy-density fraction spectrum, we meticulously analyze all the relevant Feynman-like diagrams, systematically determining their contributions to the spectrum in an order-by-order fashion. As for the angular power spectrum, our focus lies on the initial inhomogeneities that arise from the coupling between short-wavelength and long-wavelength modes due to primordial non-Gaussianities. These inhomogeneities give rise to anisotropies in SIGWs. Our analysis reveals that this spectrum exhibits a typical multipole dependence, characterized by $\tilde{C}_{\ell}\propto[\ell(\ell+1)]^{-1}$. This dependence plays a crucial role in distinguishing between different sources of gravitational waves. Moreover, depending on the model parameters, significant anisotropies of $\tilde{C}_{\ell}\sim10^{-3}$ can be achieved. Additionally, we demonstrate that the degeneracies in the model parameters can be broken. The findings of our study underscore the power of this spectrum as a robust probe for investigating primordial non-Gaussianities and exploring the physics of the early universe through gravitational-wave observations. Furthermore, the theoretical predictions derived from our research can be experimentally tested using space-borne gravitational-wave detectors and pulsar timing arrays.
#### Hints of point-symmetric structures in SN 1987A: the jittering jets  explosion mechanism

 - **Abstract**
 I identify a point-symmetric structure composed of three pairs of clumps in the recently released JWST image of the ejecta of SN 1987A and argue that these pairs of clumps support the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) for SN 1987A. I compare this point-symmetric structure with the multipolar-lobe morphology of a post-asymptotic giant branch nebula. The three pairs of clumps in the post-AGB nebula are formed at the tip of jet-inflated lobes. I use this similarity to strengthen earlier claims that SN 1987A was exploded by jets in the frame of the JJEM.
