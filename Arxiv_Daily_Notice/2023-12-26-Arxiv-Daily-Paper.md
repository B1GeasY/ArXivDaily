#### Beyond mirkwood: Enhancing SED Modeling with Conformal Predictions
 - **Authors:** Sankalp Gilda

 - **Abstract**
 Traditional spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting techniques face uncertainties due to assumptions in star formation histories and dust attenuation curves. We propose an advanced machine learning-based approach that enhances flexibility and uncertainty quantification in SED fitting. Unlike the fixed NGBoost model used in mirkwood, our approach allows for any sklearn-compatible model, including deterministic models. We incorporate conformalized quantile regression to convert point predictions into error bars, enhancing interpretability and reliability. Using CatBoost as the base predictor, we compare results with and without conformal prediction, demonstrating improved performance using metrics such as coverage and interval width. Our method offers a more versatile and accurate tool for deriving galaxy physical properties from observational data.
#### Cometary outbursts in the Oort cloud

 - **Abstract**
 Comet nuclei in the outer Solar system are constantly irradiated by cosmic rays at low temperatures. Accumulated high concentrations of radicals can undergo fast recombination with significant heating of cometary surface layers. We present the model of comet activity at large heliocentric distances caused by the recombination of radicals. We found that the considered mechanism can cause activity of comets in distant regions of the Solar system, even at the Oort cloud distances. Outbursts in distant comet reservoirs can be a new source of dust and ice particles contributing to the recently discovered anomalous diffuse light in the cosmic extragalactic background optic light. The orbits of small-radii comets in the Oort cloud are highly influenced by cometary outbursts. This effect may account for the observed decrease in the number of small-radius long-period comets.
#### Observing dark matter clumps and asteroid-mass primordial black holes in  the solar system with gravimeters and GNSS networks
 - **Authors:** Bruno Bertrand, Michal Cuadrat-Grzybowski, Pascale Defraigne, Michel Van Camp, Sébastien Clesse
 - **Subjects:** Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14520
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.14520
 - **Abstract**
 In this proceedings, we study the possible gravitational impact of primordial black holes (PBHs) or dark matter (DM) clumps on GNSS satellite orbits and gravimeter measurements. It provides a preliminary step to the future exhaustive statistical analysis over 28 years of gravimeter and GNSS data to get constraints over the density of asteroid-mass PBH and DM clumps inside the solar system. Such constraints would be the first to be obtained by direct observation on a terrestrial scale.
#### Very high-energy gamma rays from GRB 180720B and GRB 190829A with  external Compton emission

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) comprise of short, bright, energetic flashes of emission from extragalactic sources followed by a longer afterglow phase of decreased brightness. Recent discoveries of very-high-energy (VHE, $\gtrsim 100$ GeV) afterglow emission from GRB 180720B and GRB 190829A by H.E.S.S. have raised questions regarding the emission mechanism responsible. We interpret these observed late-time emission to be the result of inverse Compton emission of ultra-relativistic electrons in the GRB blastwave in an external radiation field, i.e., external Compton (EC), considering both the wind and interstellar medium scenarios. We present predictions of multiwavelength light curves and energy spectra, ranging from optical to VHE, and include the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) radiation mechanisms as well. We corrected the EC and SSC model for the $\gamma$-ray attenuation by absorption of photons through their interaction with the extragalactic background light (EBL). We compared our results to multiwavelength data and found that EC gives a satisfactory fit for a given set of fixed model parameters for GRB 180720B, whereas SSC result in a better fit for GRB 190829A. For both GRBs a wind environment is preferred over constant density inter-stellar medium, and the Cosmic Microwave Background as the external radiation field. However, with more data and an effective optimisation tool we can find a more robust fit of the model, implying better constraints on the GRB environment and the particle energy requirements for the emission observed at late times. This has consequences for future observations of GRBs at these extreme energies.
#### Virialized Profiles and Oscillations of Self-interacting Fuzzy Dark  Matter Solitons
 - **Authors:** Milos Indjin, I-Kang Liu, Nick P. Proukakis, Gerasimos Rigopoulos
 - **Subjects:** Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14917
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.14917
 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effect of self-interactions on the shape and oscillations of the solitonic core profile of condensed fuzzy dark matter systems without the backdrop of a halo, revealing universal features in terms of an appropriately scaled interaction strength characterizing the crossover between the weakly- and strongly-interacting regimes. Our semi-analytical results are further confirmed by spherically symmetric simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations. Inverting our obtained relations, we highlight a degeneracy that could significantly affect constraints on the boson mass in the presence of repulsive boson self-interactions and propose the simultaneous extraction of static and dynamical solitonic features as a way to uniquely constrain both the boson mass and self-interactions.
