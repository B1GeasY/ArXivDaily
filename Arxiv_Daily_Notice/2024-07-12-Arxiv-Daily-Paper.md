#### Fragmention in Gravitationally-Unstable Collapsar Disks and Sub-Solar Neutron Star Mergers

 - **Abstract**
 Although stable neutron stars (NS) can in principle exist down to masses Mns ~ 0.1Msun, standard models of stellar core-collapse predict a robust lower limit Mns >~ 1.2Msun, roughly commensurate with the Chandrasekhar mass Mch of the progenitor's iron core (electron fraction Ye ~ 0.5). However, this limit may be circumvented in sufficiently dense neutron-rich environments (Ye << 0.5) for which Mch ~ Ye^2 is reduced to < Msun. Such physical conditions could arise in the black hole accretion disks formed from the collapse of rapidly-rotating stars (``collapsars''), as a result of gravitational instabilities and cooling-induced fragmentation, similar to models for planet formation in protostellar disks. We confirm that the conditions to form sub-solar mass NS (ssNS) may be marginally satisfied in the outer regions of massive neutrino-cooled collapsar disks. If the disk fragments into multiple ssNS, their subsequent coalescence offers a channel for precipitating sub-solar mass LIGO/Virgo gravitational-wave mergers that does not implicate primordial black holes. The model makes several additional predictions: (1) ~Hz frequency Doppler modulation of the ssNS-merger gravitational wave signals due to the binary's orbital motion in the disk; (2) at least one additional gravitational wave event (coincident within <~ hours), from the coalescence of the ssNS-merger remnant(s) with the central black hole; (3) an associated gamma-ray burst and supernova counterpart, the latter boosted in energy and enriched with r-process elements from the NS merger(s) embedded within the exploding stellar envelope (``kilonovae inside a supernova'').

 - **Abstract**
 Strong metallicity-dependent winds dominate the evolution of core He-burning, classical Wolf-Rayet (cWR) stars, which eject both H and He-fusion products such as 14N, 12C, 16O, 19F, 22Ne and 23Na during their evolution. The chemical enrichment from cWRs can be significant. cWR stars are also key sources for neutron production relevant for the weak s-process. We calculate stellar models of cWRs at solar metallicity for a range of initial Helium star masses (12-50M), adopting the recent hydrodynamical wind rates from Sander & Vink (2020). Stellar wind yields are provided for the entire post-main sequence evolution until core O-exhaustion. While literature has previously considered cWRs as a viable source of the radioisotope 26Al, we confirm that negligible 26Al is ejected by cWRs since it has decayed to 26Mg or proton-captured to 27Al. However, in Paper I, Higgins et al. (2023) we showed that very massive stars eject substantial quantities of 26Al, among other elements including N, Ne, and Na, already from the zero-age-main-sequence. Here, we examine the production of 19F and find that even with lower mass-loss rates than previous studies, our cWR models still eject substantial amounts of 19F. We provide central neutron densities (Nn) of a 30M cWR compared with a 32M post-VMS WR and confirm that during core He-burning, cWRs produce a significant number of neutrons for the weak s-process via the 22Ne(alpha,n)25Mg reaction. Finally, we compare our cWR models with observed [Ne/He], [C/He] and [O/He] ratios of Galactic WC and WO stars.
#### Rising from the Ashes: How the Milky Way Got Its Scars

 - **Abstract**
 The elemental abundance distribution of stars encodes the history of the gas-phase abundance in the Milky Way. Without a large, unbiased sample of highly precise stellar ages, the exact timing and nature of this history must be inferred from the abundances. In the two-dimensional plane of [alpha/Fe]-[Fe/H], it is now clear that two separate populations exist -- the low-alpha and high-alpha sequences. Structure in the elemental abundance distribution can arise from many processes -- proposals include specific gas infall scenarios, radial migration, high-redshift clump formation, and various effects associated with galaxy mergers, among others. In this work, we demonstrate another possible avenue for structure formation with clear observational predictions. In this scenario, the Galaxy underwent a starburst followed by a brief (hundreds of Myr) quiescent phase -- i.e., the Galaxy underwent a post-starburst rejuvenation sequence at z~2. A natural consequence of the quiescent phase is that stars in the valley of the bimodality do not form because: (1) the absence of enrichment from high-mass stars leads to a rapid reduction in [alpha/Fe], and (2) any time the gas spends in the abundance valley is deemphasized in the present day distribution because the star formation rate is lower. With a set of idealized merger simulations, we demonstrate the feasibility of this proposal. This "phoenix hypothesis" predicts a ~300 Myr gap in stellar ages at a fixed [Fe/H] and that stars which form directly after this gap would have lower [alpha/Fe] than stars which form slightly (~1 Gyr) later.
#### Photometric and Spectroscopic study of Ten Low Mass Ratio Contact Binary Systems: Orbital Stability, O'Connell Effect and Infra-red Calcium Line Filling

 - **Abstract**
 Low mass ratio contact binary systems are more likely to have unstable orbits and potentially merge. In addition, such systems exhibit characteristics such as starspots and high energy emissions (UV) suggestive of chromospheric and magnetic activity. Light curve modelling of ten contact binary systems is reported. All were found to be of extreme low mass ratio ranging from 0.122 to 0.24 and three were found to be potentially unstable and possible merger candidates. Filling of the infrared Calcium absorption lines is a marker of increased chromospheric activity. We use the available LAMOST spectra along with matched standard spectra (broadened for rotation) to measure the excess filling of the central core depression flux of the two main infrared Calcium absorption lines at 8542 and 8662 angstroms. We find that all reported contact binaries have excess filling of the core flux in the infrared Calcium lines. Three of the systems reported were also observed by the GALEX mission and we find that all three have features of excess ultraviolet emissions further adding evidence for increased chromospheric activity in low mass ratio contact binaries. Analysis of both orbital stability and absorption line filling is dependent on the determination of geometric and absolute parameters from light curve modelling. Not an insignificant number of contact binary light curves exhibit the O'Connell effect, usually attributed to starspots. We discuss the inclusion of starspots in light curve solutions and how they influence the geometric and absolute parameters

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova theory has struggled to explain the lightest known neutron star candidate with an accurate mass determination, the $1.174\mathrm{M}_\odot$ companion in the eccentric compact binary system J0453+1559. To improve the theoretical lower limit for neutron star birth masses, we perform 3D supernova simulations for five stellar models close to the minimum mass for iron core collapse. We obtain a record-low neutron star mass of $1.192\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a substantial kick of $\mathord{\sim} 100\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Given residual uncertainties in stellar evolution, a neutron star origin for the $1.174\mathrm{M}_\odot$ object remains plausible.
#### Gaia DR3 asteroid reflectance spectra: L-type families, memberships, and ages

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) contains reflectance spectra at visible wavelengths for 60,518 asteroids over the range between 374-1034 nm, representing a large sample that is well suited to studies of asteroid families. We want to assess the potential of Gaia spectra in identifying asteroid family members. Here, we focus on two L-type families, namely Tirela/Klumpkea and Watsonia. These families are known for their connection to Barbarian asteroids, which are potentially abundant in calcium-aluminum rich inclusions (CAIs). Our method is based (1) on a color taxonomy specifically built on Gaia data and (2) the similarity of spectra of candidate members with the template spectrum of a specific family. We identified objects in the halo of Tirela/Klumpkea, along with possible interlopers. We also found an independent group of eight asteroids erroneously linked to the family by the hierarchical clustering method (HCM). Consequently, the knowledge of the size distribution of the family has been significantly improved, with a more consistent shape at the larger end. The Watsonia family is a more intricate case, mainly due to its smaller size and the less marked difference between the spectral types of the background and of the family members. However, the spectral selection helps identify objects that were not seen by HCM, including a cluster separated from the family core by a resonance. For both families, the V-shape is better defined, leading to a revised age estimation based on the memberships established mainly from spectral properties. Our work demonstrates the advantage of combining the classical HCM approach to spectral properties obtained by Gaia for the study of asteroid families. Future data releases are expected to further expand the capabilities in this domain

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from a systematic infrared (IR) census of R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars in the Milky Way, using data from the Palomar Gattini IR (PGIR) survey. R Coronae Borealis stars are dusty, erratic variable stars presumably formed from the merger of a He-core and a CO-core white dwarf (WD). PGIR is a 30 cm $J$-band telescope with a 25 deg$^{2}$ camera that surveys 18000 deg$^{2}$ of the northern sky ($\delta>-28^{o}$) at a cadence of 2 days. Using PGIR J-band lightcurves for $\sim$60 million stars together with mid-IR colors from WISE, we selected a sample of 530 candidate RCB stars. We obtained near-IR spectra for these candidates and identified 53 RCB stars in our sample. Accounting for our selection criteria, we find that there are a total of $\approx350^{+150}_{-100}$ RCB stars in the Milky Way. Assuming typical RCB lifetimes, this corresponds to an RCB formation rate of 0.8 - 5 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, consistent with observational and theoretical estimates of the He-CO WD merger rate. We searched for quasi-periodic pulsations in the PGIR lightcurves of RCB stars and present pulsation periods for 16 RCB stars. We also examined high-cadenced TESS lightcurves for RCB and the chemically similar, but dustless hydrogen-deficient carbon (dLHdC) stars. We find that dLHdC stars show variations on timescales shorter than RCB stars, suggesting that they may have lower masses than RCB stars. Finally, we identified 3 new spectroscopically confirmed and 12 candidate Galactic DY Per type stars - believed to be colder cousins of RCB stars - doubling the sample of Galactic DY Per type stars.
