 - **Abstract**
 The study of temperate sub-Neptunes is the new frontier in exoplanetary science. A major development in the past year has been the first detection of carbon-bearing molecules in the atmosphere of a temperate sub-Neptune, K2-18 b, a possible Hycean world, with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The JWST is poised to characterise the atmospheres of several other such planets with important implications for planetary processes in the temperate regime. Meanwhile, ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy has been highly successful in detecting chemical signatures of giant exoplanets, though low-mass planets have remained elusive. In the present work, we report the atmospheric reconnaissance of a temperate sub-Neptune using ground-based high-resolution transmission spectroscopy. The long orbital period and the low systemic velocity results in a low planetary radial velocity during transit, making this system a valuable testbed for high-resolution spectroscopy of temperate sub-Neptunes. We observe high-resolution time-series spectroscopy in the H- and K-bands during the planetary transit with the IGRINS instrument (R$\sim$45,000) on Gemini-South. Using observations from a single transit we find marginal evidence (2.2$\sigma$) for the presence of methane (CH$_4$) in the atmosphere and no evidence for ammonia (NH$_3$) despite its strong detectability for a cloud-free H$_2$-rich atmosphere. We assess our findings using injection tests with different atmospheric scenarios, and find them to be consistent with a high CH$_4$/NH$_3$ ratio and/or the presence of high-altitude clouds. Our results demonstrate the capability of Gemini-S/IGRINS for atmospheric characterization of temperate sub-Neptunes, and the complementarity between space- and ground-based facilities in this planetary regime.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past few years, chemical studies have revealed multiple structures in the vicinity of young stellar objects (YSOs). It has become evident that specific physical conditions are associated with the emission of particular molecular lines, allowing us to use molecular probes of the YSO physics. Consequently, chemical surveys are now necessary to fully constrain the origin of the observed structures. Several surveys have been conducted to explore the chemistry of YSOs, focusing on Class 0 and Class II objects. However, our knowledge of intermediate objects, that are Class I objects, remains limited. To bridge the gap and establish the relationship between observed structures and molecular line emission at the Class I evolutionary stage, we investigate the spatial distribution of key molecular gas species in the low-mass Class I protostar L1489 IRS (IRAS 04016+2610), a source part of the ChemYSO survey. We performed a 3mm line survey at high spatial and high spectral resolution using the NOEMA interferometer and the IRAM-30m telescope. We present here the ten brightest lines of our survey, in which we identified a new ~ 3 000 au long streamer in HC3N, C2H, and c-C3H2 emission, likely associated with more localized accretion shocks probed in SO. In addition, two ~ 10 000 au bubbles are seen with the dense molecular tracers HCO+, CS, and HCN around the YSO. Additionally, potential indicators of a second outflow appear in CS and HCN emission, but its nature remains to be confirmed. The late infall identified at large scales may originate from the nearby prestellar core L1489 and is likely responsible for the formation of an external warped disk in this system. The detection of a potential second outflow could be the direct evidence of a binary system. Finally, we hypothesize that the bubbles may result from the magnetic pressure as observed in numerical simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The majority of massive stars are members of binary systems, a fraction of which is expected to remain bound after the first star goes off as a supernova. When the second star also explodes, the SN ejecta are bound to interact with the compact object companion. We explore the consequences of this interaction in the case of a black hole (BH) companion. We show that accretion of the SN ejecta by the BH generally occurs with highly super-Eddington rates, which can be strongly modulated if the ejecta are clumpy, as typically observed in supernova remnants. This late accretion produces transient flaring activity with a time delay from the SN explosion of days to months, depending on the orbital separation and the velocity of the ejecta. The flares are expected to have a non-thermal, broad band spectrum, but their high-frequency emission (UV and X-rays) would be absorbed within the remnant. Observed flares should therefore be in the optical and near-infrared. We propose this model as an explanation to the late-time flaring activity observed in the fast blue optical transient AT2022tsd.
#### Presupernova evolution and explosive nucleosynthesis of rotating massive  stars II: the Super Solar models at [Fe/H]=0.3

 - **Abstract**
 We present an extension of the set of models published in Limongi & Chieffi, 2018, ApJS, 237, 13, at metallicity two times solar, i.e. [Fe/H]=0.3. The key physical properties of these models at the onset of the core collapse are mainly due to the higher mass loss triggered by the higher metallicity: the super solar metallicity (SSM) models reach the core collapse with smaller He- and CO-core masses, while the amount of 12C left by the central He burning is higher. These results are valid for all the rotation velocities. The yields of the neutron capture nuclei expressed per unit mass of Oxygen (i.e. the X/O) are higher in the SSM models than in the SM ones in the non rotating case while the opposite occurs in the rotating models. The trend shown by the non rotating models is the expected one, given the secondary nature of the n-capture nucleosynthesis. Vice versa, the counter intuitive trend obtained in the rotating models is the consequence of the higher mass loss present in the SSM models that removes the H rich envelope faster than in the SM ones while the stars are still in central He burning, dumping out the entanglement (activated by the rotation instabilities) and therefore a conspicuous primary n-capture nucleosynthesis.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetohydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernovae have become increasingly mature and important in recent years. Magnetic fields take center stage in scenarios for explaining hypernova explosions, but are now also considered in supernova theory more broadly as an important factor even in neutrino-driven explosions, especially in the context of neutron star birth properties. Here we present an overview of simulation approaches currently used for magnetohydrodynamic supernova simulations and sketch essential physical concepts for understanding the role of magnetic fields in supernovae of slowly or rapidly rotating massive stars. We review progress on simulations of neutrino-driven supernovae, magnetorotational supernovae, and the relevant field amplification processes. Recent results on the nucleosynthesis and gravitational wave emission from magnetorotational supernovae are also discussed. We highlight efforts to provide better initial conditions for magnetohydrodynamic supernova models by simulating short phases of the progenitor evolution in 3D to address uncertainties in the treatment of rotation and magnetic fields in current stellar evolution models.
#### Revisiting the Vertical Distribution of HI Absorbing Clouds in the Solar  Neighborhood

 - **Abstract**
 The vertical distribution of cold neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds is a constraint on models of the structure, dynamics, and hydrostatic balance of the interstellar medium. In 1978, Crovisier pioneered a method to infer the vertical distribution of HI absorbing clouds in the solar neighborhood. Using data from the Nan\c{c}ay 21-cm absorption survey, they determine the mean vertical displacement of cold HI clouds, $\langle|z|\rangle$. We revisit Crovisier's analysis and explore the consequences of truncating the HI absorption sample in Galactic latitude. For any non-zero latitude limit, we find that the quantity inferred by Crovisier is not the mean vertical displacement but rather a ratio involving higher moments of the vertical distribution. The resultant distribution scale heights are thus ${\sim}1.5$ to ${\sim}3$ times smaller than previously determined. In light of this discovery, we develop a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain method to infer the vertical distribution of HI absorbing clouds. We fit our model to the original Nan\c{c}ay data and find a vertical distribution moment ratio $\langle|z|^3\rangle/\langle|z|^2\rangle = 97 \pm 15\,\text{pc}$, which corresponds to a Gaussian scale height $\sigma_z = 61 \pm 9\,\text{pc}$, an exponential scale height $\lambda_z = 32 \pm 5\,\text{pc}$, and a rectangular half-width $W_{z, 1/2} = 129 \pm 20\,\text{pc}$. Consistent with recent simulations, the vertical scale height of cold HI clouds appears to remain constant between the inner-Galaxy and the Galactocentric distance of the solar neighborhood. Local fluctuations might explain the large scale height observed at the same Galactocentric distance on the far side of the Galaxy.
#### Unveiling the Cosmic Cradle: clustering and massive star formation in  the enigmatic Galactic bubble N59

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we have conducted an investigation focused on a segment of the $Spitzer$ mid-infrared bubble N59, specifically referred to as R1 within our study. Situated in the inner Galactic plane, this region stands out for its hosting of five 6.7 GHz methanol masers, as well as numerous compact H II regions, massive clumps, filaments, and prominent bright rims. As 6.7 GHz masers are closely linked to the initial phases of high-mass star formation, exploring regions that exhibit a high abundance of these maser detections provides an opportunity to investigate relatively young massive star-forming sites. To characterize the R1 region comprehensively, we utilize multi-wavelength (archival) data from optical to radio wavelengths, together with $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O data. Utilizing the $Gaia$ DR3 data, we estimate the distance towards the bubble to be $4.66 \pm 0.70$ kpc. By combining near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) data, we identify 12 Class I and 8 Class II sources within R1. Furthermore, spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis of selected sources reveals the presence of four embedded high-mass sources with masses ranging from 8.70-14.20 M$_\odot$. We also identified several O and B-type stars from radio continuum analysis. Our molecular study uncovers two distinct molecular clouds in the region, which, although spatially close, occupy different regions in velocity space. We also find indications of a potential hub-filament system fostering star formation within the confines of R1. Finally, we propose that the feedback from the H II regions has led to the formation of prominent Bright Rimmed Clouds (BRC) within our region of interest.
#### N$_2$H$^+$(1-0) as a tracer of dense gas in and between spiral arms

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advances in identifying giant molecular filaments in galactic surveys allow us to study the interstellar material and its dense, potentially star forming phase on scales comparable to resolved extragalactic clouds. Two large filaments detected in the CHIMPS $^{13}$CO(3-2) survey, one in the Sagittarius-arm and one in an inter-arm region, were mapped with dense gas tracers inside a 0.06 deg$^2$ area and with a spatial resolution of around 0.4 and 0.65 pc at the distance of the targets using the IRAM 30m telescope, to investigate the environmental dependence of the dense gas fraction. The N$_2$H$^+$(1-0) transition, an excellent tracer of the dense gas, was detected in parsec-scale, elliptical clumps and with a filling factor of around 8.5% in our maps. The N$_2$H$^+$-emitting areas appear to have higher dense gas fraction (e.g. the ratio of N$_2$H$^+$ and $^{13}$CO emission) in the inter-arm than in the arm which is opposite to the behaviour found by previous studies, using dust emission rather than N$_2$H$^+$ as a tracer of dense gas. However, the arm filament is brighter in $^{13}$CO and the infrared emission of dust, and the dense gas fraction determined as above is governed by the $^{13}$CO brightness. We caution that measurements regarding the distribution and fraction of dense gas on these scales may be influenced by many scale- and environment-dependent factors, as well as the chemistry and excitation of the particular tracers, then consider several scenarios that can reproduce the observed effect.
#### ATMOSPHERIX: III- Estimating the C/O ratio and molecular dynamics at the  limbs of WASP-76 b with SPIRou

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring the abundances of C- and O-bearing species in exoplanet atmospheres enables us to constrain the C/O ratio, that contains indications about the planet formation history. With a wavelength coverage going from 0.95 to 2.5 microns, the high-resolution (R$\sim$70 000) spectropolarimeter SPIRou can detect spectral lines of major bearers of C and O in exoplanets. Here we present our study of SPIRou transmission spectra of WASP-76 b acquired for the ATMOSPHERIX program. We applied the publicly available data analysis pipeline developed within the ATMOSPHERIX consortium, analysing the data using 1-D models created with the petitRADTRANS code, with and without a grey cloud deck. We report the detection of H$_2$O and CO at a Doppler shift of around -6 km.s$^{-1}$, consistent with previous observations of the planet. Finding a deep cloud deck to be favoured, we measured in mass mixing ratio (MMR) log(H$_2$O)$_{MMR}$ = -4.52 $\pm$ 0.77 and log(CO)$_{MMR}$ = -3.09 $\pm$ 1.05 consistent with a sub-solar metallicity to more than 1$\sigma$. We report 3$\sigma$ upper limits for the abundances of C$_2$H$_2$, HCN and OH. We estimated a C/O ratio of 0.94 $\pm$ 0.39 ($\sim$ 1.7 $\pm$ 0.7 x solar, with errors indicated corresponding to the 2$\sigma$ values) for the limbs of WASP-76 b at the pressures probed by SPIRou. We used 1-D ATMO forward models to verify the validity of our estimation. Comparing them to our abundance estimations of H$_2$O and CO, as well as our upper limits for C$_2$H$_2$, HCN and OH, we found that our results were consistent with a C/O ratio between 1 and 2 x solar, and hence with our C/O estimation. Finally, we found indications of asymmetry for both H$_2$O and CO when investigating the dynamics of their signatures, pointing to a complex scenario involving possibly both a temperature difference between limbs and clouds being behind the asymmetry this planet is best known for.
