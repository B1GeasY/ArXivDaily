#### A Comprehensive Theory for Neutron Star and Black Hole Kicks and Induced  Spins

 - **Abstract**
 Using twenty long-term 3D core-collapse supernova simulations, we find that lower compactness progenitors that explode quasi-spherically due to the short delay to explosion experience smaller neutron star recoil kicks in the $\sim$100$-$200 km s$^{-1}$ range, while higher compactness progenitors that explode later and more aspherically leave neutron stars with kicks in the $\sim$300$-$1000 km s$^{-1}$ range. In addition, we find that these two classes are correlated with the gravitational mass of the neutron star. This correlation suggests that the survival of binary neutron star systems may in part be due to their lower kick speeds. We also find a correlation of the kick with both the mass dipole of the ejecta and the explosion energy. Furthermore, one channel of black hole birth leaves masses of $\sim$10 $M_{\odot}$, is not accompanied by a neutrino-driven explosion, and experiences small kicks. A second is through a vigorous explosion that leaves behind a black hole with a mass of $\sim$3.0 $M_{\odot}$ kicked to high speeds. We find that the induced spins of nascent neutron stars range from seconds to $\sim$10 milliseconds and that a spin/kick correlation for pulsars emerges naturally. We suggest that if an initial spin biases the explosion direction, a spin/kick correlation is a common byproduct of the neutrino mechanism of core-collapse supernovae. Finally, the induced spin in explosive black hole formation is likely large and in the collapsar range. This new 3D model suite provides a greatly expanded perspective and appears to explain some observed pulsar properties by default.

 - **Abstract**
 Given the inexorable increase in the Sun's luminosity, Earth will exit the habitable zone in ~1 Gyr. There is a negligible chance that Earth's orbit will change during that time through internal Solar System dynamics. However, there is a ~1% chance per Gyr that a star will pass within 100 au of the Sun. Here, we use N-body simulations to evaluate the possible evolutionary pathways of the planets under the perturbation from a close stellar passage. We find a ~92% chance that all eight planets will survive on orbits similar to their current ones if a star passes within 100 au of the Sun. Yet a passing star may disrupt the Solar System, by directly perturbing the planets' orbits or by triggering a dynamical instability. Mercury is the most fragile, with a destruction rate (usually via collision with the Sun) higher than that of the four giant planets combined. The most probable destructive pathways for Earth are to undergo a giant impact (with the Moon or Venus) or to collide with the Sun. Each planet may find itself on a very different orbit than its present-day one, in some cases with high eccentricities or inclinations. There is a small chance that Earth could end up on a more distant (colder) orbit, through re-shuffling of the system's orbital architecture, ejection into interstellar space (or into the Oort cloud), or capture by the passing star. We quantify plausible outcomes for the post-flyby Solar System.
#### Insight into the Formation of $β$ Pic b through the Composition of  Its Parent Protoplanetary Disk as Revealed by the $β$ Pic Moving Group  Member HD 181327

 - **Abstract**
 It has been suggested that $\beta$ Pic b has a supersolar metallicity and subsolar C/O ratio. Assuming solar carbon and oxygen abundances for the star $\beta$ Pic and therefore the planet's parent protoplanetary disk, $\beta$ Pic b's C/O ratio suggests that it formed via core accretion between its parent protoplanteary disk's H$_{2}$O and CO$_{2}$ ice lines. $\beta$ Pic b's high metallicity is difficult to reconcile with its mass $M_{\text{p}}~=~11.7~M_{\text{Jup}}$ though. Massive stars can present peculiar photospheric abundances that are unlikely to record the abundances of their former protoplanetary disks. This issue can be overcome for early-type stars in moving groups by infering the elemental abundances of the FGK stars in the same moving group that formed in the same molecular cloud and presumably share the same composition. We infer the photospheric abundances of the F dwarf HD 181327, a $\beta$ Pic moving group member that is the best available proxy for the composition of $\beta$ Pic b's parent protoplanetary disk. In parallel, we infer updated atmospheric abundances for $\beta$ Pic b. As expected for a planet of its mass formed via core-accretion beyond its parent protoplanetary disk's H$_{2}$O ice line, we find that $\beta$ Pic b's atmosphere is consistent with stellar metallicity and confirm that is has superstellar carbon and oxygen abundances with a substellar C/O ratio. We propose that the elemental abundances of FGK dwarfs in moving groups can be used as proxies for the otherwise difficult-to-infer elemental abundances of early-type and late-type members of the same moving groups.
#### Under the light of a new star: evolution of planetary atmospheres  through protoplanetary disc dispersal and boil-off

 - **Abstract**
 The atmospheres of small, close-in exoplanets are vulnerable to rapid mass-loss during protoplanetary disc dispersal via a process referred to as `boil-off', in which confining pressure from the local gas disc reduces, inducing atmospheric loss and contraction. We construct self-consistent models of planet evolution during gaseous core accretion and boil-off. As the surrounding disc gas dissipates, we find that planets lose mass via subsonic breeze outflows which allow causal contact to exist between disc and planet. Planets initially accrete of order $\sim 10\%$ in atmospheric mass, however, boil-off can remove $\gtrsim 90\%$ of this mass during disc dispersal. We show that a planet's final atmospheric mass fraction is strongly dictated by the ratio of cooling timescale to disc dispersal timescale, as well as the planet's core mass and equilibrium temperature. With contributions from core cooling and radioactivity, we show that core luminosity eventually leads to the transition from boil-off to core-powered mass-loss. We find that smaller mass planets closest to their host star may have their atmospheres completely stripped through a combination of boil-off and core-powered mass-loss during disc dispersal, implying the existence of a population-level radius gap emerging as the disc disperses. We additionally consider the transition from boil-off/core-powered mass-loss to X-ray/EUV (XUV) photoevaporation by considering the penetration of stellar XUV photons below the planet's sonic surface. Finally, we show that planets may open gaps in their protoplanetary discs during the late stages of boil-off, which may enhance mass-loss rates.

 - **Abstract**
 WASP-107b is a warm ($\sim$740 K) transiting planet with a Neptune-like mass of $\sim$30.5 $M_{\oplus}$ and Jupiter-like radius of $\sim$0.94 $R_{\rm J}$, whose extended atmosphere is eroding. Previous observations showed evidence for water vapour and a thick high-altitude condensate layer in WASP-107b's atmosphere. Recently, photochemically produced sulphur dioxide (SO$_2$) was detected in the atmosphere of a hot ($\sim$1,200 K) Saturn-mass planet from transmission spectroscopy near 4.05 $\mu$m, but for temperatures below $\sim$1,000 K sulphur is predicted to preferably form sulphur allotropes instead of SO$_2$. Here we report the 9$\sigma$-detection of two fundamental vibration bands of SO$_2$, at 7.35 $\mu$m and 8.69 $\mu$m, in the transmission spectrum of WASP-107b using the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) of the JWST. This discovery establishes WASP-107b as the second irradiated exoplanet with confirmed photochemistry, extending the temperature range of exoplanets exhibiting detected photochemistry from $\sim$1,200 K down to $\sim$740 K. Additionally, our spectral analysis reveals the presence of silicate clouds, which are strongly favoured ($\sim$7$\sigma$) over simpler cloud setups. Furthermore, water is detected ($\sim$12$\sigma$), but methane is not. These findings provide evidence of disequilibrium chemistry and indicate a dynamically active atmosphere with a super-solar metallicity.
#### Radio survey of the stellar population in the infrared dark cloud  G14.225-0.506

 - **Abstract**
 The IRDC G14.225-0.506 is associated with a network of filaments, which result in two different dense hubs, as well as with several signposts of star formation activity. The aim of this work is to study the cm continuum emission to characterize the stellar population in G14.2. We performed deep (~1.5-3 microJy) radio continuum observations at 6 and 3.6 cm using the VLA in the A configuration (~0.3''). We have also made use of observations taken during different days to study the presence of variability at short timescales. We detected a total of 66 sources, 32 in the northern region G14.2-N and 34 in the southern region G14.2-S. Ten of the sources are found to be variable. Based on their spectral index, the emission in G14.2-N is mainly dominated by non-thermal sources while G14.2-S contains more thermal emitters. Approximately 75% of the sources present a counterpart at other wavelengths. In the inner 0.4~pc region around the center of each hub, the number of IR sources in G14.2-N is larger than in G14.2-S by a factor of 4. We also studied the relation between the radio luminosity and the bolometric luminosity, finding that the thermal emission of the studied sources is compatible with thermal radio jets. For our sources with X-ray counterparts, the non-thermal emitters follow a G\"udel-Benz relation with k = 0.03. We found similar levels of fragmentation between G14.2-N and G14.2-S, suggesting that both regions are most likely twin hubs. The non-thermal emission found in the less evolved objects suggests that G14.2-N may be composed of more massive YSOs as well as being in a more advanced evolutionary stage, consistent with the filament-halo gradient in age and mass from previous works. Our results confirm a wider evolutionary sequence starting in G14.2-S as the youngest part, followed by G14.2-N, and ending with the most evolved region M17.
