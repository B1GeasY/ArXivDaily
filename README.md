#### Towards cosmological inference on unlabeled out-of-distribution HI observational data

 - **Abstract**
 We present an approach that can be utilized in order to account for the covariate shift between two datasets of the same observable with different distributions, so as to improve the generalizability of a neural network model trained on in-distribution samples (IDs) when inferring cosmology at the field level on out-of-distribution samples (OODs) of {\it unknown labels}. We make use of HI maps from the two simulation suites in CAMELS, IllustrisTNG and SIMBA. We consider two different techniques, namely adversarial approach and optimal transport, to adapt a target network whose initial weights are those of a source network pre-trained on a labeled dataset. Results show that after adaptation, salient features that are extracted by source and target encoders are well aligned in the embedding space, indicating that the target encoder has learned the representations of the target domain via the adversarial training and optimal transport. Furthermore, in all scenarios considered in our analyses, the target encoder, which does not have access to any labels ($\Omega_{\rm m}$) during adaptation phase, is able to retrieve the underlying $\Omega_{\rm m}$ from out-of-distribution maps to a great accuracy of $R^{2}$ score $\ge$ 0.9, comparable to the performance of the source encoder trained in a supervised learning setup. We further test the viability of the techniques when only a few out-of-distribution instances are available and find that the target encoder still reasonably recovers the matter density. Our approach is critical in extracting information from upcoming large scale surveys.
#### DECaPS and SMA discovery of a highly-inclined class I YSO with an outflow: IRAS 08235-4316

 - **Abstract**
 We present images of IRAS~08235--4316 with the Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey (DECaPS; spanning 0.398--1.034$\,\mu$m, at ${\sim}1''$ resolution) and the Submillimeter Array (SMA; at 1.38\,mm/217\,GHz, at ${\sim}1.9''\times1.2''$ resolution), a YSO located in the Vela constellation near to the Puppis boundary, detected in a systematic search for new large/extended emission sources. The DECaPS data show an asymmetric bi--polar morphology with a large angular extent of ${\sim}7.1''$ separated by a dark lane, characteristic of highly--inclined protoplanetary disks and less-evolved YSOs with outflows. The SMA data show an extended continuum structure along the optical dark lane with a smaller angular extent of ${\sim}4.6''$. The detected $^{12}$CO J=2--1 emission tentatively shows a velocity gradient along the position angle of the dark lane/millimeter continuum, that may trace rotating gas. Additional $^{12}$CO emission is present which could trace infalling/outflowing gas, and/or a nearby gas cloud. We estimate a distance to IRAS~08235--4316 of at least ${\sim}191\,$pc. Supported by additional SED modelling, we infer IRAS~08235--4316 to be a newly discovered class~I YSO with an outflow, host to an embedded protoplanetary disk, with a large millimeter radius of ${\sim}440$\,au and dust mass ${\gtrsim}11\,M_\oplus$.
#### Testing the Breakdown of the Asteroseismic Scaling Relations in Luminous Red Giants

 - **Abstract**
 Nearly all cool, evolved stars are solar-like oscillators, and fundamental stellar properties can be inferred from these oscillations with asteroseismology. Scaling relations are commonly used to relate global asteroseismic properties, the frequency of maximum power $\nu_{max}$ and the large frequency separation $\Delta \nu$, to stellar properties. Mass, radius, and age can then be inferred with the addition of stellar spectroscopy. There is excellent agreement between seismic radii and fundamental data on the lower red giant branch and red clump. However, the scaling relations appear to breakdown in luminous red giant stars. We attempt to constrain the contributions of the asteroseismic parameters to the observed breakdown. We test the $\nu_{max}$ and $\Delta \nu$ scaling relations separately, by using stars of known mass and radius in star clusters and the Milky Way's high-$\alpha$ sequence. We find evidence that the $\Delta \nu$-scaling relation contributes to the observed breakdown in luminous giants more than the $\nu_{max}$ relation. We test different methods of mapping the observed $\Delta \nu$ to the mean density via a correction factor, $F_{\Delta \nu}$ and find a $\approx 1 - 3\%$ difference in the radii in the luminous giant regime depending on the technique used to measure $F_{\Delta \nu}$. The differences between the radii inferred by these two techniques are too small on the luminous giant branch to account for the inflated seismic radii observed in evolved giant stars. Finally, we find that the $F_{\Delta \nu}$ correction is insensitive to the adopted mixing length, chosen by calibrating the models to observations of $T_{eff}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Rocky planets in our Solar System, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and the Moon, which is generally added to this group due to its geological complexity, possess a solid surface and share a common structure divided into major layers, namely a silicate crust, a silicate mantle, and an iron-rich core. However, while all terrestrial planets share a common structure, the thickness of their interior layers, their bulk chemical composition, and surface expressions of geological processes are often unique to each of them. In this chapter we provide an overview of the surfaces and interiors of rocky planets in the Solar System. We list some of the major discoveries in planetary exploration and discuss how they have helped to answer fundamental questions about planetary evolution while at the same time opening new avenues. For each of the major planetary layers, i.e., the surface, the crust and lithosphere, the mantle, and the core, we review key geological and geophysical processes that have shaped the planets that we observe today. Understanding the similarities and differences between the terrestrial planets in the Solar System will teach us about the diversity of evolutionary paths a planet could follow, helping us to better understand our own home, the Earth.

 - **Abstract**
 The energy provided in the radioactive decay of thorium (Th) and uranium (U) isotopes, embedded in planetary mantles, sustains geodynamics important for surface habitability such as the generation of a planetary magnetic dynamo. In order to better understand the thermal evolution of nearby exoplanets, stellar photospheric abundances can be used to infer the material composition of orbiting planets. Here we constrain the intrinsic dispersion of the r-process element europium (Eu) (measured in relative abundance [Eu/H]) as a proxy for Th and U in local F, G, and K type dwarf stars. Adopting stellar-chemical data from two high quality spectroscopic surveys, we have determined a small intrinsic scatter of 0.025 dex in [Eu/H] within the disk. We further investigate the stellar anti-correlation in [Eu/$\alpha$] vs [$\alpha$/H] at late metallicities to probe in what regimes planetary radiogenic heating may lead to periods of extended dynamo collapse. We find that only near-solar metallicity stars in the disk have Eu inventories supportive of a persistent dynamo in attendant planets, supporting the notion of a ``metallicity Goldilocks zone'' in the galactic disk. The observed anti-correlation further provides novel evidence regarding the nature of r-processes injection by substantiating $\alpha$ element production is decoupled from Eu injection. This suggests either a metallicity-dependent r-process in massive core-collapse supernovae, or that neutron-star merger events dominate r-process production in the recent universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) represent a significant fraction of core-collapse supernovae, arising from massive stars that have shed their hydrogen and, in some cases, helium envelopes. The origins and explosion mechanisms of SESNe remain a topic of active investigation. In this work, we employ radiative-transfer simulations to model the light curves and spectra of a set of explosions of single, solar-metallicity, massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars with ejecta masses ranging from 4 to 11 Msun, that were computed from a turbulence-aided and neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. We analyze these synthetic observables to explore the impact of varying ejecta mass and helium content on observable features. We find that the light curve shape of these progenitors with high ejecta masses is consistent with observed SESNe with broad light curves but not the peak luminosities. The commonly used analytic formula based on rising bolometric light curves overestimates the ejecta mass of these high-initial-mass progenitor explosions by a factor up to 2.6. In contrast, the calibrated method by Haynie et al., which relies on late-time decay tails, reduces uncertainties to an average of 20% within the calibrated ejecta mass this http URL, the He I 1.083 um line remains prominent even in models with as little as 0.02 Msun of helium. However, the strength of the optical He I lines is not directly proportional to the helium mass but instead depends on a complex interplay of factors such as 56Ni distribution, composition, and radiation field. Thus, producing realistic helium features requires detailed radiative transfer simulations for each new hydrodynamic model.
#### An Extreme Stellar Prominence Eruption Observed by LAMOST Time-Domain Spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of an extreme stellar prominence eruption on the M dwarf LAMOST J044431.62+235627.9, observed through time-domain H$\alpha$ spectroscopy with the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). This prominence eruption was accompanied by a superflare lasting over 160.4 minutes. The H$\alpha$ line profile exhibits significant blue-wing enhancement during the impulsive phase and near the flare peak, with a projected bulk blueshift velocity of $-228\pm11$~km~s$^{-1}$ and a maximum blueshift velocity reaching $-605\pm15$~km~s$^{-1}$. Velocity analysis of the eruptive prominence at various heights above the stellar surface indicates that some of the projected ejection velocities along the line of sight exceed the corresponding escape velocities, suggesting a potential coronal mass ejection (CME). The equivalent width (EW) of the H$\alpha$ blue-wing enhancement in this eruption appears to be the largest observed to date and is comparable to the EW of the H$\alpha$ line profile during the quiescent phase of the host star. We performed a two-cloud modeling for the prominence and the associated flare, which suggests that the eruptive prominence has a mass ranging from $1.6 \times 10^{19}~\text{g}$ to $7.2 \times 10^{19}~\text{g}$. More importantly, the mass ratio of the erupting prominence to its host star is the largest among all reported stellar prominence eruptions/CMEs.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the role of turbulence in shaping the interstellar medium (ISM) is crucial for studying star formation, molecular cloud evolution, and cosmic ray propagation. Central to this is the measurement of the sonic Mach number ($M_s$), which quantifies the ratio of turbulent velocity to the sound speed. In this work, we introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach for estimating $M_s$ directly from spectroscopic observations. The approach leverages the physical correlation between increasing $M_s$ and the shock-induced small-scale fluctuations that alter the morphological features in intensity, velocity centroid, and velocity channel maps. These maps, derived from 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence simulations, serve as inputs for the CNN training. By learning the relationship between these structural features and the underlying turbulence properties, CNN can predict $M_s$ under various conditions, including different magnetic fields and levels of observational noise. The median uncertainty of the CNN-predicted $M_s$ ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 depending on the noise level. While intensity maps offer lower uncertainty, channel maps have the advantage of predicting the 3D $M_s$ distribution, which is crucial in estimating 3D magnetic field strength. Our results demonstrate that machine-learning-based tools can effectively characterize complex turbulence properties in the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on 32162 molecular clouds from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting project, we obtain new face-on molecular gas maps of the northern outer Galaxy. The total molecular gas surface density map reveals three segments of spirals, extending 16-43 kiloparsecs in length. The Perseus and Outer arms stand out prominently, appearing as quasi-continuous structures along most of their length. At the Galactic outskirts, about 1306 clouds connect the two segments of the new spiral arm discovered by Dame & Thaddeus (2011) in the first quadrant and Sun et al. (2015) in the second quadrant, possibly extending the arm into the outer third quadrant. Logarithmic spirals can be fitted to the CO arm segments with pitch angles ranging from 4 to 12 degree. These CO arms extend beyond previous CO studies and the optical radius, reaching a galactic radius of about 22 kiloparsecs, comparable to the HI radial range.
#### Shear Particle Acceleration in Structured Gamma-Ray Burst Jets: I. Physical Origin of the Band Function and Application to GRBs 090926A, 131108A, and 160509A

 - **Abstract**
 The radiation physics of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains an open question. Based on the simulation analysis and recent observations, it was proposed that GRB jets are composed of a narrow ultra-relativistic core surrounded by a wide sub-relativistic cocoon. We show that emission from the synchrotron radiations and the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) process of shear-accelerated electrons in the mixed jet-cocoon (MJC) region and internal-shock-accelerated electrons in the jet core is potentially explained the spectral characteristics of the prompt gamma-rays. Assuming an exponential-decay velocity profile, the shear flow in the MJC region can accelerate electrons up to $\gamma_{\rm e,\max} \sim 10^4$ for injected electrons with $\gamma_{\rm e,inject}=3 \times 10^2$, if its magnetic field strength ($B_{\rm cn}$) is $100$ G and its inner-edge velocity ($\beta_{\rm cn, 0}$) is 0.9c. The cooling of these electrons is dominated by the SSC process, and the emission flux peaks at the keV band. In addition, the energy flux of synchrotron radiations of internal-shock-accelerated electrons ($\gamma_e=10^{4}\sim 10^{5}$) peaks at around the keV$-$MeV band, assuming a bulk Lorentz factor of 300, a magnetic field strength of $\sim 10^{6}$ G for the jet core. Adding the flux from both the jet core and the MJC region, the total spectral energy distribution (SED) illustrates similar characteristics as the broadband observations of GRBs. The bimodal and Band-Cut spectra observed in GRBs 090926A, 131108A, and 160509A can be well fit with our model. The derived $B_{\rm cn}$ varies from 54 G to 450 G and $\beta_{\rm cn,0}=0. 83\sim 0.91$c.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the solution approach developed by the team `TheAntipodes' during the 12th edition of the Global Trajectory Optimization Competition (GTOC 12). An overview of the approach is as follows: (1) generate asteroid subsets, (2) chain building with beam search, (3) convex low-thrust trajectory optimization, (4) manual refinement of rendezvous times, and (5) optimal solution set selection. The generation of asteroid subsets involves a heuristic process to find sets of asteroids that are likely to permit high-scoring asteroid chains. Asteroid sequences `chains' are built within each subset through a beam search based on Lambert transfers. Low-thrust trajectory optimization involves the use of sequential convex programming (SCP), where a specialized formulation finds the mass-optimal control for each ship's trajectory within seconds. Once a feasible trajectory has been found, the rendezvous times are manually refined with the aid of the control profile from the optimal solution. Each ship's individual solution is then placed into a pool where the feasible set that maximizes the final score is extracted using a genetic algorithm. Our final submitted solution placed fifth with a score of $15,489$.
#### Interpreting the LHAASO Galactic diffuse emission data

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the Large High-Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) collaboration has obtained a measurement of the gamma-ray diffuse emission in the ultra-high energy range, $10-10^3$ TeV after masking the contribution of known sources. The measurement appears to be 2-3 times higher than the gamma-ray signal expected from the hadronic interactions of diffuse cosmic rays with the interstellar medium, potentially suggesting a contribution from unresolved sources. However, estimates of the diffuse emission are affected by large uncertainties that must be accounted for. In this work, we calculate the hadronic gamma-ray diffuse emission including uncertainties in the gas content of the Galactic disk, in the energy and spatial distribution of cosmic rays as well as in the hadronic interaction cross-section. We show that the LHAASO data above $\sim 30$ TeV are consistent with the gamma-ray diffuse emission model when all these uncertainties are taken into account. This implies that, with the current data in this energy range, there is no need to invoke a cosmic ray spectral variation toward the Galactic center, nor a dominant contribution from unresolved sources.
#### On the intrinsic rest wavelengths of diffuse interstellar bands

 - **Abstract**
 The rest wavelengths of DIBs are of fundamental importance owing to the lack of unambiguous identification for these mysterious features. Usually the wavelengths of DIBs are estimated using known interstellar lines serving to shift the spectrum to the rest wavelengths velocity scale. However, the latter may not share in fact the same parts of a cloud which carriers of DIBs occupy. Here we argue that the narrowest known DIB 6196 A is the best reference feature. Also, we offer the geometrical center of gravity (the effective wavelength) of diffuse bands as a rest wavelength measurer for these generally asymmetric features. The exception is DIB 6196: its symmetrical (bottom) part must be used as a reference for the interstellar wavelength scale, and its center of gravity serves to study the variability of the feature visible at the upper part of its profile. We assessed the magnitude of variation of the center of gravity of DIBs at 5780, 5797, 6284 and 7224 A measured in 41 objects in the range of E{B-V} between 0.13 and 1.06 mag. with the lack of Doppler-split in profiles of interstellar atomic/molecular lines. To estimate the width of diffuse bands we offer to apply a parameter "effective width" W_eff which is the relation of the equivalent width to the depth of the feature. In contrast to habitual FWHM, W_eff is not sensitive to the profile shape irregularities. W_eff provides lower uncertainties of the measurements than the FWHM does. The gradual increase of W_eff, accompanied with the red-shift of the center of gravity of the profile, may suggest populating of higher transitions of P-branch of the bands of molecules, assuming the latter are DIB carriers. It is also shown, that diffuse bands are broader although more shallow in the harsh conditions of sigma-clouds. The difference of the effective width of DIBs in zeta and sigma clouds is discussed as well.

 - **Abstract**
 The double detonation is a widely discussed explosion mechanism for Type Ia supernovae, whereby a helium shell detonation ignites a secondary detonation in the carbon/oxygen core of a white dwarf. Even for modern models that invoke relatively small He shell masses, many previous studies have found that the products of the helium shell detonation lead to discrepancies with normal Type Ia supernovae, such as strong Ti II absorption features, extremely red light curves and too large a variation with viewing direction. It has been suggested that non local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) effects may help to reduce these discrepancies with observations. Here we carry out full non-LTE radiative transfer simulations for a recent double detonation model with a relatively small helium shell mass of 0.05 M$_\odot$. We construct 1D models representative of directions in a 3D explosion model to give an indication of viewing angle dependence. The full non-LTE treatment leads to improved agreement between the models and observations. The light curves become less red, due to reduced absorption by the helium shell detonation products, since these species are more highly ionised. Additionally, the expected variation with observer direction is reduced. The full non-LTE treatment shows promising improvements, and reduces the discrepancies between the double detonation models and observations of normal Type Ia supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of various molecular species, including complex organic molecules relevant to biochemical and geochemical processes, in astronomical settings such as the interstellar medium or the outer Solar System has led to the increased need for a better understanding of the chemistry occurring in these cold regions of space. In this context, the chemistry of ices prepared and processed at cryogenic temperatures has proven to be of particular interest due to the fact that many interstellar molecules are believed to originate within the icy mantles adsorbed on nano- and micro-scale dust particles. The chemistry leading to the formation of such molecules may be initiated by ionising radiation in the form of galactic cosmic rays or stellar winds, and thus there has been an increased interest in commissioning experimental set-ups capable of simulating and better characterising this solid-phase radiation astrochemistry. In this article, we describe a new facility called AQUILA (Atomki-Queen's University Ice Laboratory for Astrochemistry) which has been purposefully designed to study the chemical evolution of ices analogous to those that may be found in the dense interstellar medium or the outer Solar System as a result of their exposure to keV ion beams. The results of some ion irradiation studies of CH3OH ice at 20 K are discussed to exemplify the experimental capabilities of the AQUILA as well as to highlight its complementary nature to another laboratory astrochemistry set-up at our institute.

 - **Abstract**
 This work aims to spectroscopically characterize and provide for the first time direct experimental frequencies of the ground vibrational state and two excited states of the simplest alkynyl thiocyanate (HCCSCN) for astrophysical use. Both microwave (8-16~GHz) and millimeter wave regions (50-120~GHz) of the spectrum have been measured and analyzed in terms of Watson's semirigid rotor Hamiltonian. A total of 314 transitions were assigned to the ground state of HCCSCN and a first set of spectroscopic constants have been accurately determined. Spectral features of the molecule were then searched for in Sgr B2(N), NGC 6334I, G+0.693-0.027 and TMC-1 molecular clouds. Upper limits to the column density are provided.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate Roche lobe overflow mass transfer (MT) in eccentric binary systems between stars and compact objects (COs), modeling the coupled evolution of both the star and the orbit due to eccentric MT (eMT) in a self-consistent framework. We implement the analytic expressions for secular rates of change of the orbital semi-major axis and eccentricity, assuming a delta function MT at periapse, into the binary stellar evolution code MESA. Two scenarios are examined: (1) a simplified model isolating the effects of eMT on stellar and orbital evolution, and (2) realistic binary configurations that include angular momentum exchange (e.g., tides, mass loss, spin-orbit coupling, and gravitational wave radiation). Unlike the ad hoc approach of instant circularization that is often employed, explicit modeling of eMT reveals a large fraction of binaries can remain eccentric post-MT. Even binaries which naturally circularize during eMT have different properties (donor mass and orbital size) compared to predictions from instant circularization, with some showing fundamentally different evolutionary outcomes (e.g., stable versus unstable MT). We demonstrate that a binary's initial mass ratio and eccentricity are predictive of whether it will remain eccentric or circularize after eMT. These findings underscore the importance of eMT in understanding CO-hosting binary populations, including X-ray binaries, gravitational wave sources, and other high-energy transients.
