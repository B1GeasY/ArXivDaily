 - **Abstract**
 We performed the first simulations of accretion onto the compact objects in the Reissner-Nordström (RN) spacetime. The results obtained in general relativity are representative of those for spherically symmetric naked singularities and black holes in a number of modified gravity theories. A possible application of these calculations is to the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with their powerful jets. It is now possible to compare the results of such simulations with the accreting supermassive objects in our own Milky Way and the nearest spiral galaxy: observations of the core regions of galactic nuclei (Sgr A* and M87) performed with unprecedented resolution by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration allow fairly direct tests of the spacetime-metric of the central compact object. In this context we present general-relativistic hydrodynamical simulation results of accretion from an orbiting accretion torus (with a cusp) onto a RN black hole and a RN naked singularity. The results could not be more different for the two cases. For a black hole, just as in the familiar Kerr/Schwarzschild case, matter overflowing the cusp plunges into the black hole horizon. For the naked singularity, the accreting matter forms an inner structure of toroidal topology and leaves the system via powerful outflows. It is an open question whether this inner structure can give rise to an image quantitatively similar to the ones reported by EHT for M87 and Sgr A*.

 - **Abstract**
 The exact two-dimensional non-stationary solution for the evolution of the magnetic field during accretion with nearly spherical symmetry, using Newton's solution and considering both Keplerian and sub-Keplerian flows around the black hole (BH), has been derived using the Schwarzschild metric. In this paper, we also discuss the possible origins of large-scale magnetic field production around black holes (BHs). For example, the origin of this strong large-scale magnetic field could be the interstellar medium or a companion star outside the accretion disk, which is drawn in by the accretion plasma and grows over time. The findings show that the uniform magnetic field of a subsonic flow, which is weak at infinity, increases with time and evolves into a quasi-radial field. This is true for both types of flows. We have also observed that the growth of the radial component of the magnetic field is more pronounced in the sub-Keplerian flow than in the Keplerian flow. However, it is worth noting that, for both types of flows, the magnetic field does not reach its saturation value in the regions $r> r_{c}$; instead, the process of strengthening and growing the magnetic field progresses to a point where the disk evolves from its initial condition to a state close to the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state, forming a sub-MAD state.
#### Arecibo Wow! I: An Astrophysical Explanation for the Wow! Signal

 - **Abstract**
 The Ohio State University Big Ear radio telescope detected in 1977 the Wow! Signal, one of the most famous and intriguing signals of extraterrestrial origin. Arecibo Wow! is a new project that aims to find similar signals in archived data from the Arecibo Observatory. From 2017 to 2020, we observed many targets of interest at 1 to 10 GHz with the 305-meter telescope. Here we present our first results of drift scans made between February and May 2020 at 1420 MHz. The methods, frequency, and bandwidth of these observations are similar to those used to detect the Wow! Signal. However, our observations are more sensitive, have better temporal resolution, and include polarization measurements. We report the detection of narrowband signals (10 kHz) near the hydrogen line similar to the Wow! Signal, although two-orders of magnitude less intense and in multiple locations. Despite the similarities, these signals are easily identifiable as due to interstellar clouds of cold hydrogen (HI) in the galaxy. We hypothesize that the Wow! Signal was caused by sudden brightening from stimulated emission of the hydrogen line due to a strong transient radiation source, such as a magnetar flare or a soft gamma repeater (SGR). These are very rare events that depend on special conditions and alignments, where these clouds might become much brighter for seconds to minutes. The original source or the cloud might not be detectable, depending on the sensitivity of the telescope. The precise location of the Wow! Signal might be determined by searching for transient radio sources behind the cold hydrogen clouds in the corresponding region. Our hypothesis explains all observed properties of the Wow! Signal, proposes a new source of false positives in technosignature searches, and suggests that the Wow! Signal could be the first recorded event of an astronomical maser flare in the hydrogen line.
#### Splitting and eruption of an active region filament caused by magnetic reconnection

 - **Abstract**
 To gain a deeper understanding of the intricate process of filament eruption, we present a case study of a filament splitting and eruption by using multi-wavelength data of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). It is found that the magnetic reconnection between the filament and the surrounding magnetic loops resulted in the formation of two new filaments, which erupted successively. The observational evidences of magnetic reconnection, such as the obvious brightening at the junction of two different magnetic structures, the appearance of a bidirectional jet, and subsequent filament splitting, were clearly observed. Even though the two newly formed filaments experienced failed eruptions, three obvious dimmings were observed at the footpoints of the filaments during their eruptions. Based on these observations, it is suggested that magnetic reconnection is the trigger mechanism for the splitting of the original filament and the subsequent eruption of the newly formed filaments. Furthermore, the process of filament splitting dominated by magnetic reconnection can shed light on the explanation of double-deck filament formation.
#### Formation of the interstellar sugar precursor, (Z)-1,2-ethenediol, through radical reactions on dust grains

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, the continued detection of complex organic molecules of prebiotic interest has refueled the interest on a panspermic origin of life. The prebiotic molecule glyceraldehyde is proposed to be formed from (Z)-1,2-ethenediol, a molecule recently detected towards the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud at the galactic center. In this work, we computationally simulate the formation of (Z)-1,2-ethenediol from vinyl alcohol on the surface of amorphous solid water in a two-step synthesis involving a OH addition and a H abstraction reaction. In total, we considered all reaction possibilities of the 1,1 and 1,2-OH addition to vinyl alcohol followed by H-abstraction or H-addition reactions on the resulting radicals. The combination of these reactions is capable of explaining the formation of (Z)-1,2-ethenediol provided a suprathermal diffusion of OH. We also conclude that our proposed formation pathway is not selective and also yields other abstraction and addition products. Key in our findings is the connection between the adsorption modes of the reactants and intermediates and the stereoselectivity of the reactions.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08611

 - **Abstract**
 We devise and exploit a data-driven, semi-empirical framework of galaxy formation and evolution, coupling it to recipes for planet formation from stellar and planetary science, to compute the cosmic planet formation rate, and the properties of the planets' preferred host stellar and galactic environments. We also discuss how the rates and formation sites of planets are affected when considering their habitability, and when including possible threatening sources related to star formation and nuclear activity. Overall, we conservatively estimate a cumulative number of some $10^{20}$ Earth-like planets and around $10^{18}$ habitable Earths in our past lightcone. Finally, we find that a few $10^{17}$ are older than our own Earth, an occurrence which places a loose lower limit a few $10^{-18}$ to the odds for a habitable world to ever hosting a civilization in the observable Universe.
#### Instability and Evolution of Shocked Clouds Formed by Orthogonal Collisions between Magnetized Filamentary Molecular Clouds

 - **Abstract**
 Filamentary molecular clouds are recognized as primary sites for the formation of stars. Specifically, regions characterized by the overlapping point of multiple filaments, known as hub regions, often associated with active star formation. However, the formation mechanism of this hub structure is not well understood. Therefore, to understand the formation mechanism and star formation in hub structures, as a first step, we investigate the orthogonal collisions between two filaments using three-dimensional ideal magnetohydrodynamical simulations. As a model of initial filaments, we use an infinitely long filament in magnetohydrostatic equilibrium under a global magnetic field running perpendicular to the filament axis. Two identical equilibrium filaments, sharing the same magnetic flux, are arranged with their long axes perpendicular to each other and given an initial velocity perpendicular to their long axes to replicate an orthogonal collision. We find three types of evolution after the shocked cloud is formed: collapse, stable, and expansion modes. The energy balance just after the filaments completely collide explains the future evolution of the shocked cloud. If the magnitude of gravitational energy is larger than the sum of the kinetic, thermal, and magnetic energies, the shocked cloud evolves in collapse mode. If the magnitude of gravitational energy is less than the sum of these energies, the cloud evolves in stable mode when the kinetic energy is relatively small and in expansion mode when the kinetic energy is sufficiently large.
