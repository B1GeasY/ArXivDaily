#### Nucleosynthetic Analysis of Long-Term Three-Dimensional Core-Collapse  Supernova Simulations
 - **Authors:** Tianshu Wang, Adam Burrows

 - **Abstract**
 We study in detail the ejecta conditions and theoretical nucleosynthetic results for 17 three-dimensional core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations done by F{\sc ornax}. We find that multi-dimensional effects introduce many complexities into ejecta conditions. We see stochastic electron fraction evolution, complex peak temperature distributions and histories, and long-tail distributions of the time spent within nucleosynthetic temperature ranges. These all lead to substantial variation in CCSN nucleosynthetic yields and differences with 1D results. We discuss the production of lighter $\alpha$-nuclei, radioactive isotopes, heavier elements, and a few isotopes of special interest. Comparing pre-CCSN and CCSN contributions, we find that a significant fraction of elements between roughly Si and Ge are generically produced in CCSNe. We find that $^{44}$Ti exhibits an extended production timescale compared to $^{56}$Ni, which may explain its different distribution and higher than previously predicted abundances in supernova remnants such as Cas A and SN1987A. We also discuss the morphology of the ejected elements. This study highlights the high-level diversity of ejecta conditions and nucleosynthetic results in 3D CCSN simulations and emphasizes the need for additional long-term 3D simulations to properly address such complexities.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic dawn 21-cm signal is enabled by Ly~$\alpha$ photons through a process called the Wouthuysen-Field effect. An accurate model of the signal in this epoch hinges on the accuracy of the computation of the Ly~$\alpha$ coupling, which requires one to calculate the specific intensity of UV radiation from sources such as the first stars. Most traditional calculations of the Ly~$\alpha$ coupling assume a delta-function scattering cross-section, as the resonant nature of the Ly~$\alpha$ scattering makes an accurate radiative transfer solution computationally expensive. Attempts to improve upon this traditional approach using numerical radiative transfer have recently emerged. However, the radiative transfer computation in these treatments suffers from assumptions such as a uniform density of intergalactic gas, zero gas temperature, and absence of gas bulk motion, or numerical approximations such as core skipping. We investigate the role played by these approximations in setting the value of the Ly~$\alpha$ coupling and the 21-cm signal at cosmic dawn. We present results of Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations, without core skipping, and show that neglecting gas temperature in the radiative transfer significantly underestimates the scattering rate and hence the Ly~$\alpha$ coupling and the 21-cm signal. We also discuss the effect of these processes on the 21-cm power spectrum from the cosmic dawn. This work points the way towards higher-accuracy models to enable better inferences from future measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 In order to shed light on the characteristics of the broad line region (BLR) in a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy, we present an analysis of X-ray, UV, and optical spectroscopic observations of the broad emission lines in Mrk 110. For the broad-band modelling of the emission-line luminosity, we adopt the `locally optimally emitting cloud' approach, which allows us to place constraints on the gas radial and density distribution. By exploring additional environmental effects, we investigate the possible scenarios resulting in the observed spectra. We find that the photoionised gas in Mrk 110 responsible for the UV emission can fully account for the observed low-ionisation X-ray lines. The overall ionisation of the gas is lower, and one radial power-law distribution with a high integrated covering fraction $C_{\mathrm{f}} \approx 0.5$ provides an acceptable description of the emission lines spanning from X-rays to the optical band. The BLR is likely more compact than the broad-line Seyfert 1s studied so far, extending from $\sim\!10^{16}$ to $\sim\!10^{18}$ cm, and limited by the dust sublimation radius at the outer edge. Despite the large colour excess predicted by the Balmer ratio, the best fit suggests $E(B-V)\approx0.03$ for both the ionising luminosity and the BLR, indicating that extinction might be uniform over a range of viewing angles. While the adopted data-modelling technique does not allow us to place constraints on the geometry of the BLR, we show that the addition of models with a clumpy, equatorial, wind-like structure may lead to a better description of the observed spectra.
#### Type Ia Supernova Progenitor Properties and Their Host Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We present an eigenfunction method to analyze 161 visual light curves (LCs) of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained by the Carnegie Supernova Project to characterize their diversity and host-galaxy correlations. The eigenfunctions are based on the delayed-detonation scenario using three parameters: the LC stretch being determined by the amount of deflagration-burning governing the 56Ni production, the main-sequence mass M_MS of the progenitor white dwarf controlling the explosion energy, and its central density rho_c shifting the 56Ni distribution. Our analysis tool (SPAT) extracts the parameters from observations and projects them into physical space using their allowed ranges M_MS < 8 M_sun, rho_c < 7-8x10^9g/cc. The residuals between fits and individual LC-points are ~ 1-3% for ~ 92% of objects. We find two distinct M_MS groups corresponding to a fast (~ 40-65 Myrs) and a slow(~ 200-500 Myrs) stellar evolution. Most underluminous SNe Ia have hosts with low star formation but high M_MS, suggesting slow evolution times of the progenitor system. 91T-likes SNe show very similar LCs and high M_MS and are correlated to star formation regions, making them potentially important tracers of star formation in the early Universe out to z = 4-11. Some 6% outliers with `non-physical' parameters can be attributed to superluminous SNe Ia and subluminous SNe Ia with hosts of active star formation. For deciphering the SNe Ia diversity and high-precision SNe Ia cosmology, the importance is shown for LCs covering out to ~ 60 days past maximum. Finally, our method and results are discussed within the framework of multiple explosion scenarios, and in light of upcoming surveys.
#### ASTERIA -- Asteroid Thermal Inertia Analyzer

 - **Abstract**
 Thermal inertia estimates are available for a limited number of a few hundred objects, and the results are practically solely based on thermophysical modeling (TPM). We present a novel thermal inertia estimation method, Asteroid Thermal Inertia Analyzer (ASTERIA). The core of the ASTERIA model is the Monte Carlo approach, based on the Yarkovsky drift detection. We validate our model on asteroid Bennu plus ten well-characterized near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) for which a good estimation of the thermal inertia from the TPM exists. The tests show that the ASTERIA provides reliable results consistent with the literature values. The new method is independent from the TPM, allowing an independent verification of the results. As the Yarkovsky effect is more pronounced in small asteroids, the noteworthy advantage of the ASTERIA compared to the TPM is the ability to work with smaller asteroids for which TPM typically lacks the input data. We used the ASTERIA to estimate the thermal inertia of 38 NEAs, with 31 of them being sub-km asteroids. Twenty-nine objects in our sample are characterized as Potentially Hazardous Asteroids. On the limitation side, the ASTERIA is somewhat less accurate than the TPM. The applicability of our model is limited to NEAs, as the Yarkovsky effect is yet to be detected in main-belt asteroids. However, we can expect a significant increase in high-quality measurements of the input parameters relevant to the ASTERIA with upcoming surveys. This will surely increase the reliability of the results generated by the ASTERIA and widen the model's applicability.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the 1970s, astronomers have struggled with the issue of how matter can be accreted to promote black hole growth. While low-angular-momentum stars may be devoured by the black hole, they are not a sustainable source of fuel. Gas, which could potentially provide an abundant fuel source, presents another challenge due to its enormous angular momentum. While viscous torques are not significant, gas is subject to gravity torques from non-axisymmetric potentials such as bars and spirals. Primary bars can exchange angular momentum with the gas inside corotation, driving it inward spiraling until the inner Lindblad resonance is reached. An embedded nuclear bar can then take over. As the gas reaches the black hole's sphere of influence, the torque turns negative, fueling the center. Dynamical friction also accelerates the infall of gas clouds closer to the nucleus. However, due to the Eddington limit, growing a black hole from a stellar-mass seed is a slow process. The existence of very massive black holes in the early universe remains a puzzle that could potentially be solved through direct collapse of massive clouds into black holes or super-Eddington accretion.
#### Directly Characterizing Dome Seeing: Differential Image Motion Sensor  Using Multisources (DIMSUM)

 - **Abstract**
 Image degradation impedes our ability to extract information from astronomical observations. One factor contributing to this degradation is ``dome seeing", the reduction in image quality due to variations in the index of refraction within the observatory dome. Addressing this challenge, we introduce a novel setup-DIMSUM (Differential Image Motion Sensor Using Multisources)-which offers a simple installation and provides direct characterization of local index of refraction variations. This is achieved by measuring differential image motion using strobed imaging that effectively``freezes" the atmosphere, aligning our captured images with the timescale of thermal fluctuations, thereby giving a more accurate representation of dome seeing effects. Our apparatus has been situated within the Auxiliary Telescope of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Early results from our setup are encouraging. Not only do we observe a correlation between the characteristic differential image motion (DIM) values and local temperature fluctuations (a leading cause of variations in index of refraction), but also hint at the potential of DIM measures to characterize dome seeing with greater precision in subsequent tests. Our preliminary findings underscore the potential of DIMSUM as a powerful tool for enhancing image quality in ground-based astronomical observations. Further refinement and data collection will likely solidify its place as a useful component for managing dome seeing in major observatories like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.
#### Narrowing down the parameters for the supermassive black hole binary in  J1048+7143

 - **Abstract**
 Analyzing single-dish and VLBI radio, as well as Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray observations, we explained the three major $\gamma$-ray flares in the $\gamma$-ray light curve of FSRQ J1048+7143 with the spin-orbit precession of the dominant mass black hole in a supermassive black hole binary system. Here, we report on the detection of a fourth $\gamma$-ray flare from J1048+7143, appearing in the time interval which was predicted in our previous work. Using the updated analysis covering the time range between 2008 Aug 4 and 2023 Jun 4, we further constrain the parameters of the hypothetical supermassive binary black hole at the heart of J1048+7143 and we predict the occurrence of the fifth major $\gamma$-ray flare that would appear only if the jet will still lay close to our line sight. The fourth major $\gamma$-ray flare also shows the two-subflare structure, further strengthening our scenario in which the occurrence of the subflares is the signature of the precession of a spine-sheath jet structure that quasi-periodically interacts with a proton target, e.g. clouds in the broad-line region.
#### Cloud-cloud collision in S235: triggered the formation of high-mass  stars and young star clusters

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of cloud-cloud collision (CCC) process in the Galactic molecular complex S235. Our new CO observations performed with the PMO-13.7m telescope reveal two molecular clouds, namely the S235-Main and the S235-ABC, with $\sim$ 4 km s$^{-1}$ velocity separation. The bridge feature, the possible colliding interface and the complementary distribution of the two clouds are significant observational signatures of cloud-cloud collision in S235. The most direct evidence of cloud-cloud collision process in S235 is that the S235-Main (in a distance of 1547$^{+44}_{-43}$ pc) and S235-ABC (1567$^{+33}_{-39}$ pc) meet at almost the same position (within 1$\sigma$ error range) at a supersonic relative speed. We identified ten $^{13}$CO clumps from PMO-13.7m observations, 22 dust cores from the archival SCUBA-2 data, and 550 YSOs from NIR-MIR data. 63$\%$ of total YSOs are clustering in seven MST groups (M1$-$M7). The tight association between the YSO groups (M1 $\&$ M7) and the bridge feature suggests that the CCC process triggers star formation there. The collisional impact subregion (the South) shows $3\sim5$ times higher CFE and SFE (average value of 12.3$\%$ and 10.6$\%$, respectively) than the non-collisional impact subregion (2.4$\%$ and 2.6$\%$, respectively), suggesting that the CCC process may have enhanced the CFE and SFE of the clouds compared to those without collision influence.
