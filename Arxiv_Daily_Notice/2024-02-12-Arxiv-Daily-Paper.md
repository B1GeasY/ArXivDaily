 - **Abstract**
 The transiting dust clouds that orbit the white dwarf J0328-1219 are devoid of small particles (< 0.1 micron). Observations show that fade amount doesn't depend on wavelength. This finding resembles a similar observation for white dwarf WD 1145+017, but the explanations for an absence of small particles in the two white dwarf systems may differ due to their different distances from the star.

 - **Abstract**
 We report sub-pc-scale observations of the 321-GHz H$_2$O emission line in the radio galaxy NGC 1052. The H$_2$O line emitter size is constrained in $< 0.6$ milliarcsec distributed on the continuum core component. The brightness temperature exceeding $10^6$ K and the intensity variation indicate certain evidence for maser emission. The maser spectrum consists of redshifted and blueshifted velocity components spanning $\sim 400$ km s$^{-1}$, separated by a local minimum around the systemic velocity of the galaxy. Spatial distribution of maser components show velocity gradient along the jet direction, implying that the population-inverted gas is driven by the jets interacting with the molecular torus. We identified significant change of the maser spectra between two sessions separated by 14 days. The maser profile showed a radial velocity drift of $127 \pm 13$ km s$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ implying inward gravitational acceleration at 5000 Schwarzschild radii. The results demonstrate feasibility of future VLBI observations to resolve the jet-torus interacting region.

 - **Abstract**
 In this fourth paper from the AGORA Collaboration, we study the evolution down to redshift $z=2$ and below of a set of cosmological zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way mass galaxy by eight of the leading hydrodynamic simulation codes. We also compare this CosmoRun suite of simulations with dark matter-only simulations by the same eight codes. We analyze general properties of the halo and galaxy at $z=4$ and 3, and before the last major merger, focusing on the formation of well-defined rotationally-supported disks, the mass-metallicity relation, the specific star formation rate, the gas metallicity gradients, and the non-axisymmetric structures in the stellar disks. Codes generally converge well to the stellar-to-halo mass ratios predicted by semi-analytic models at $z\sim$2. We see that almost all the hydro codes develop rotationally-supported structures at low redshifts. Most agree within 0.5 dex with the observed MZR at high and intermediate redshifts, and reproduce the gas metallicity gradients obtained from analytical models and low-redshift observations. We confirm that the inter-code differences in the halo assembly history reported in the first paper of the collaboration also exist in CosmoRun, making the code-to-code comparison more difficult. We show that such differences are mainly due to variations in code-dependent parameters that control the time-stepping strategy of the gravity solver. We find that variations in the early stellar feedback can also result in differences in the timing of the low-redshift mergers. All the simulation data down to $z=2$ and the auxiliary data will be made publicly available.
#### Devolatilization of extrasolar planetesimals by 60Fe and 26Al heating

 - **Abstract**
 Whilst the formation of Solar system planets is constrained by meteoritic evidence, the geophysical history of low-mass exoplanets is much less clear. The bulk composition and climate states of rocky exoplanets may vary significantly based on the composition and properties of the planetesimals they form from. An important factor influenced by planetesimal composition is water content, where the desiccation of accreting planetesimals impacts the final water content of the resultant planets. While the inner planets of the Solar system are comparatively water-poor, recent observational evidence from exoplanet bulk densities and planetary formation models suggest that rocky exoplanets engulfed by substantial layers of high-pressure ices or massive steam atmospheres could be widespread. Here we quantify variations in planetesimal desiccation due to potential fractionation of the two short-lived radioisotopes 26Al and 60Fe relevant for internal heating on planetary formation timescales. We focus on how order of magnitude variations in 60Fe can affect the water content of planetesimals, and how this may alter the formation of extrasolar ocean worlds. We find that heating by 26Al is the dominant cause of planetesimal heating in any Solar system analogue scenario, thus validating previous works focussing only on this radioisotope. However, 60Fe can become the primary heating source in the case of high levels of supernova enrichment in massive star-forming regions. These diverging scenarios can affect the formation pathways, bulk volatile budget, and climate diversity of low-mass exoplanets.
#### Cool Gaseous Exoplanets: surveying the new frontier with Twinkle

 - **Abstract**
 Cool gaseous exoplanets ($1.75\ R_\oplus < R_\text{p} < 3\ R_\text{J}$, $200$ K $<T_\text{eq} < 1000$~K) are an as-yet understudied population, with great potential to expand our understanding of planetary atmospheres and formation mechanisms. In this paper, we outline the basis for a homogeneous survey of cool gaseous planets with Twinkle, a 0.45-m diameter space telescope with simultaneous spectral coverage from 0.5-4.5~$\mu$m, set to launch in 2025. We find that Twinkle has the potential to characterise the atmospheres of 36 known cool gaseous exoplanets (11~sub-Neptunian, 11~Neptunian, 14~Jovian) at an SNR $\geq$ 5 during its 3-year primary mission, with the capability of detecting most major molecules predicted by equilibrium chemistry to > $5\sigma$ significance. We find that an injected mass-metallicity trend is well-recovered, demonstrating Twinkle's ability to elucidate this fundamental relationship into cool regime. We also find Twinkle will be able to detect cloud layers at 3$\sigma$ or greater in all cool gaseous planets for clouds at $\leq$ 10 Pa pressure level, but will be insensitive to clouds deeper than $10^4$ Pa in all cases. With these results we demonstrate the capability of the Twinkle mission to greatly expand the current knowledge of cool gaseous planets, enabling key insights and constraints to be obtained for this poorly-charted region of exoplanet parameter space.

 - **Abstract**
 We fit various colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of the Galactic globular clusters NGC\,6397 and NGC\,6809 (M55) by isochrones from the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database (DSED) and Bag of Stellar Tracks and Isochrones (BaSTI) for $\alpha$-enhanced [$\alpha$/Fe]$=+0.4$. For the CMDs, we use data sets from {\it HST}, {\it Gaia}, VISTA, and other sources utilizing 32 and 23 photometric filters for NGC\,6397 and NGC\,6809, respectively, from the ultraviolet to mid-infrared. We obtain the following characteristics for NGC\,6397 and NGC\,6809, respectively: metallicities [Fe/H]$=-1.84\pm0.02\pm0.1$ and $-1.78\pm0.02\pm0.1$ (statistic and systematic uncertainties); distances $2.45\pm0.02\pm0.06$ and $5.24\pm0.02\pm0.18$ kpc; ages $12.9\pm0.1\pm0.8$ and $13.0\pm0.1\pm0.8$ Gyr; reddenings $E(B-V)=0.178\pm0.006\pm0.01$ and $0.118\pm0.004\pm0.01$ mag; extinctions $A_\mathrm{V}=0.59\pm0.01\pm0.02$ and $0.37\pm0.01\pm0.04$ mag; extinction-to-reddening ratio $R_\mathrm{V}=3.32^{+0.32}_{-0.28}$ and $3.16^{+0.66}_{-0.56}$. Our estimates agree with most estimates from the literature. BaSTI gives systematically higher [Fe/H] and lower reddenings than DSED. Despite nearly the same metallicity, age, and helium enrichment, these clusters show a considerable horizontal branch (HB) morphology difference, which must therefore be described by another parameter. This parameter must predominantly explain why the least massive HB stars (0.58-0.63 solar masses) are only found within NGC 6809. Probably they have been lost by the core-collapse cluster NGC\,6397 during its dynamical evolution and mass segregation. In contrast, NGC\,6809 has a very low central concentration and, hence, did not undergo this process.
#### Supernova dust destruction in the magnetized turbulent ISM

 - **Abstract**
 Dust in the interstellar medium (ISM) is critical to the absorption and intensity of emission profiles used widely in astronomical observations, and necessary for star and planet formation. Supernovae (SNe) both produce and destroy ISM dust. In particular the destruction rate is difficult to assess. Theory and prior simulations of dust processing by SNe in a uniform ISM predict quite high rates of dust destruction, potentially higher than the supernova dust production rate in some cases. Here we show simulations of supernova-induced dust processing with realistic ISM dynamics including magnetic field effects and demonstrate how ISM inhomogeneity and magnetic fields inhibit dust destruction. Compared to the non-magnetic homogeneous case, the dust mass destroyed within 1 Myr per SNe is reduced by more than a factor of two, which can have a great impact on the ISM dust budget.
