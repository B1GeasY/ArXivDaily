 - **Abstract**
 Context. The study of protoplanetary disks is fundamental to understand their evolution and interaction with the surrounding environment, and to constrain planet formation mechanisms. Aims. We aim at characterising the young binary system HD 34700 A, which shows a wealth of structures. Methods. Taking advantage of the high-contrast imaging instruments SPHERE at the VLT, LMIRCam at the LBT, and of ALMA observations, we analyse this system at multiple wavelengths. We study the rings and spiral arms morphology and the scattering properties of the dust. We discuss the possible causes of all the observed features. Results. We detect for the first time, in the H${\alpha}$ band, a ring extending from $\sim$65 au to ${\sim}$120 au, inside the ring already known from recent studies. These two have different physical and geometrical properties. Based on the scattering properties, the outer ring may consist of grains of typical size $a_{out} > 4 {\mu}m$, while the inner ring of smaller grains ($a_{in} <= 0.4 {\mu m}$). Two extended logarithmic spiral arms stem from opposite sides of the disk. The outer ring appears as a spiral arm itself, with a variable radial distance from the centre and extended substructures. ALMA data confirm the presence of a millimetric dust substructure centred just outside the outer ring, and detect misaligned gas rotation patterns for HD 34700 A and B. Conclusions. The complexity of HD 34700 A, revealed by the variety of observed features, suggests the existence of one or more disk-shaping physical mechanisms. Possible scenarios, compatible with our findings, involve the presence inside the disk of a yet undetected planet of several Jupiter masses and the system interaction with the surroundings by means of gas cloudlet capture or flybys. Further observations with JWST/MIRI or ALMA (gas kinematics) could shed more light on these.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the connection between the properties of black holes (BHs) and their progenitors is interesting in many branches of astrophysics. Discovering BHs in detached orbits with luminous companions (LCs) promises to help create this map since the LC and BH progenitor are expected to have the same metallicity and formation time. We explore the possibility of detecting BH-LC binaries in detached orbits using photometric variations of the LC flux, induced by tidal ellipsoidal variation, relativistic beaming, and self-lensing. We create realistic present-day populations of detached BH-LC binaries in the Milky Way (MW) using binary population synthesis where we adopt observationally motivated initial stellar and binary properties, star formation history and present-day distribution of these sources in the MW based on detailed cosmological simulations. We test detectability of these sources via photometric variability by Gaia and TESS missions by incorporating their respective detailed detection biases as well as interstellar extinction. We find that Gaia (TESS) is expected to resolve ~700-1500 (~100-400) detached BH-LC binaries depending on the photometric precision and details of supernova physics. We find that ~369 BH-LC binaries would be common both in Gaia and TESS. Moreover, between ~80-270 (~70-290) of these BH-LC binaries can be further characterised using Gaia's radial velocity (astrometry) measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new ALMA CO(2-1) observations tracing $2.2 \times 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ of molecular gas in Abell 2390's brightest cluster galaxy, where half the gas is located in a one-sided plume extending 15 kpc out from the galaxy centre. This molecular gas has a smooth and positive velocity gradient, and is receding 250 km/s faster at its farthest point than at the galaxy centre. To constrain the plume's origin, we analyse our new observations alongside existing X-ray, optical and radio data. We consider the possibility that the plume is jet-driven with lifting aided by jet inflated X-ray bubbles. Alternatively, it may have formed following a gravitational disturbance. In this case, the plume may either be a trail of gas stripped from the main galaxy by ram pressure, or more recently cooled and infalling gas. The galaxy's star formation and gas cooling rate suggest the lifespan of its molecular gas may be low compared with the plume's age -- which would favour a recently cooled plume. Molecular gas in close proximity to the active galactic nucleus is also indicated by 250 km/s wide CO(2-1) absorption against the radio core, as well as previously detected CO(1-0) and HI absorption. This absorption is optically thick and has a line of sight velocity towards the galaxy centre of 200 km/s. We discuss simple models to explain its origin.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the chemo-dynamical analysis of SPLUS J142445.34-254247.1, an extremely metal-poor halo star enhanced in elements formed by the rapid neutron-capture process. This star was first selected as a metal-poor candidate from its narrow-band S-PLUS photometry and followed up spectroscopically in medium-resolution with Gemini South/GMOS, which confirmed its low-metallicity status. High-resolution spectroscopy was gathered with GHOST at Gemini South, allowing for the determination of chemical abundances for 36 elements, from carbon to thorium. At [Fe/H]=-3.39, SPLUS J1424-2542 is one of the lowest metallicity stars with measured Th and has the highest logeps(Th/Eu) observed to date, making it part of the "actinide-boost" category of r-process enhanced stars. The analysis presented here suggests that the gas cloud from which SPLUS J1424-2542 was formed must have been enriched by at least two progenitor populations. The light-element (Z<=30) abundance pattern is consistent with the yields from a supernova explosion of metal-free stars with 11.3-13.4 Msun, and the heavy-element (Z>=38) abundance pattern can be reproduced by the yields from a neutron star merger (1.66Msun and 1.27Msun) event. A kinematical analysis also reveals that SPLUS J1424-2542 is a low-mass, old halo star with a likely in-situ origin, not associated with any known early merger events in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs that have accreted planetary materials provide a powerful tool to probe the interiors and formation of exoplanets. In particular, the high Fe/Si ratio of some white dwarf pollutants suggests that they are fragments of bodies that were heated enough to undergo large-scale melting and iron core formation. In the solar system, this phenomenon is associated with bodies that formed early and so had short-lived radionuclides to power their melting, and/or grew large. However, if the planetary bodies accreted by white dwarfs formed during the (pre)-main sequence lifetime of the host star, they will have potentially been exposed to a second era of heating during the star's giant branches. This work aims to quantify the effect of stellar irradiation during the giant branches on planetary bodies by coupling stellar evolution to thermal and orbital evolution of planetesimals. We find that large-scale melting, sufficient to form an iron core, can be induced by stellar irradiation, but only in close-in small bodies: planetesimals with radii $\lesssim$ 30 km originally within $\sim$ 2 AU orbiting a 1$-$3$\,M_{\odot}$ host star with solar metallicity. Most of the observed white dwarf pollutants are too massive to be explained by the accretion of these small planetesimals that are melted during the giant branches. Therefore, we conclude that those white dwarfs that have accreted large masses of materials with enhanced or reduced Fe/Si remain an indicator of planetesimal's differentiation shortly after formation, potentially linked to radiogenic heating.
#### The Blanco DECam Bulge Survey (BDBS) VIII: Chemo-kinematics in the  southern Galactic bulge from 2.3 million red clump stars with Gaia DR3 proper  motions

 - **Abstract**
 The Blanco DECam Bulge Survey (BDBS) provides near-ultraviolet to near-infrared photometry for ~250 million unique stars. By combining BDBS photometry with the latest Gaia astrometry, we characterize the chemo-dynamics of red clump stars across the BDBS footprint, using an unprecedented sample size and sky coverage. We construct a sample of ~2.3 million red clump giants in the bulge with photometric metallicities, BDBS photometric distances, and proper motions. We study the kinematics of the red clump stars as a function of sky position and metallicity, by investigating proper motion rotation curves, velocity dispersions, and proper motion correlations across the southern Galactic bulge. We find that metal-poor red clump stars exhibit lower rotation amplitudes, at ~29 km s$^{-1}$ kpc^{-1}. The peak of the angular velocity is ~39 km s^{-1} kpc^{-1} for [Fe/H] ~ -0.2 dex, exhibiting declining rotation at higher [Fe/H]. The velocity dispersion is higher for metal-poor stars, while metal-rich stars show a steeper gradient with Galactic latitude, with a maximum dispersion at low latitudes along the bulge minor axis. Only metal-rich stars ([Fe/H] >~ -0.5 dex) show clear signatures of the bar in their kinematics, while the metal-poor population exhibits isotropic motions with an axisymmetric pattern around Galactic longitude l = 0. This work reports the largest sample of bulge stars with distance, metallicity, and astrometry and shows clear kinematic differences with metallicity. The global kinematics over the bulge agrees with earlier studies. However, we see striking changes with increasing metallicity and for the first time, see kinematic differences for stars with [Fe/H]>-0.5, suggesting that the bar itself may have kinematics that depends on metallicity.
