 - **Abstract**
 The sensitivity of current and future neutrino detectors like Super-Kamiokande (SK), JUNO, Hyper-Kamiokande (HK), and DUNE is expected to allow for the detection of the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB). However, the DSNB model ingredients like the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) rate, neutrino emission spectra, and the fraction of failed supernovae are not precisely known. We quantify the uncertainty on each of these ingredients by (i) compiling a large database of recent star formation rate density measurements, (ii) combining neutrino emission from long-term axisymmetric CCSNe simulations and strategies for estimating the emission from the protoneutron star cooling phase, and (iii) assuming different models of failed supernovae. Finally, we calculate the fluxes and event rates at multiple experiments and perform a simplified statistical estimate of the time required to significantly detect the DSNB at SK with the gadolinium upgrade and JUNO. Our fiducial model predicts a flux of $5.1\pm0.4^{+0.0+0.5}_{-2.0-2.7}\,{\rm cm^2~s^{-1}}$ at SK employing Gd-tagging, or $3.6\pm0.3^{+0.0+0.8}_{-1.6-1.9}$ events per year, where the errors represent our uncertainty from star formation rate density measurements, uncertainty in neutrino emission, and uncertainty in the failed-supernova scenario. In this fiducial calculation, we could see a $3\sigma$ detection by $\sim2030$ with SK-Gd and a $5\sigma$ detection by $\sim2035$ with a joint SK-Gd/JUNO analysis, but background reduction remains crucial.

 - **Abstract**
 The observed chemical diversity of Milky Way stars places important constraints on Galactic chemical evolution and the mixing processes that operate within the interstellar medium. Recent works have found that the chemical diversity of disk stars is low. For example, the APOGEE "chemical doppelganger rate," or the rate at which random pairs of field stars appear as chemically similar as stars born together, is high, and the chemical distributions of APOGEE stars in some Galactic populations are well-described by two-dimensional models. However, limited attention has been paid to the heavy elements (Z > 30) in this context. In this work, we probe the potential for neutron-capture elements to enhance the chemical diversity of stars by determining their effect on the chemical doppelganger rate. We measure the doppelganger rate in GALAH DR3, with abundances rederived using The Cannon, and find that considering the neutron-capture elements decreases the doppelganger rate from 2.2% to 0.4%, nearly a factor of 6, for stars with -0.1 < [Fe/H] < 0.1. While chemical similarity correlates with similarity in age and dynamics, including neutron-capture elements does not appear to select stars that are more similar in these characteristics. Our results highlight that the neutron-capture elements contain information that is distinct from that of the lighter elements and thus add at least one dimension to Milky Way abundance space. This work illustrates the importance of considering the neutron-capture elements when chemically characterizing stars and motivates ongoing work to improve their atomic data and measurements in spectroscopic surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 In line with the Astro2020 Decadal Report State of the Profession findings and the NASA core value of Inclusion, the NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Bridge Program was created to provide financial and programmatic support to efforts that work to increase the representation and inclusion of students from under-represented minorities in the STEM fields. To ensure an effective program, particularly for those who are often left out of these conversations, the NASA SMD Bridge Program Workshop was developed as a way to gather feedback from a diverse group of people about their unique needs and interests. The Early Career Perspectives Working Group was tasked with examining the current state of bridge programs, academia in general, and its effect on students and early career professionals. The working group, comprised of 10 early career and student members, analyzed the discussions and responses from workshop breakout sessions and two surveys, as well as their own experiences, to develop specific recommendations and metrics for implementing a successful and supportive bridge program. In this white paper, we will discuss the key themes that arose through our work, and highlight select recommendations for the NASA SMD Bridge Program to best support students and early career professionals.
#### Photometric candidate selection and spectroscopic confirmation of new  PNe and SySts in the Galactic plane

 - **Abstract**
 About 3,500 planetary nebulae (PNe) are currently known in the Milky Way, which shows a great discrepancy with the expected number for these objects, regardless of the reference used, $33-59 \times 10^{3}$. The same holds for symbiotic stars (SySts) as well, since the expected number in the Galaxy ($3-400 \times 10^{3}$) differs considerably from the amount of known ones (approximately 300). Studies on PNe and SySts are of great importance because they provide vital clues to the understanding of the late-stage of stellar evolution for low-to-intermediate mass stars. In addition, these classes of objects play a large role in the chemical evolution of the Galaxy through the ejection of their material to the interstellar medium (ISM), enriching it with the various chemical elements produced throughout their evolution. This project aims to contribute to the detection of new PNe and SySts in the Galaxy, thus decreasing the discrepancy between the observed and theoretical populations. Using simultaneously the third data release from the optical survey VPHAS+ (The VST Photometric H$\alpha$ Survey of the Southern Galactic Plane and Bulge), which maps the southern hemisphere of the Galaxy's plane with the $r$, $i$, and H{$\alpha$} filters, and the IR colors of the catalog AllWISE (Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer + The Two Micron All Sky Survey), we end up with a number of PN and SySt candidates. Subsequently, we confirm the nature of these objects through spectroscopic observations at the SOAR telescope (Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope). So far, we have selected PN candidates and performed the spectroscopic follow-up of 8 of them. In this presentation we show the project's preliminary results, which consist of the discovery of at least one new planetary nebula, and other emission-line sources still to be confirmed either as PN or SySt.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary stars play a major role in determining the dynamic evolution of star clusters. We used images collected with the Hubble Space Telescope to study fourteen Magellanic Clouds star clusters that span an age interval between $\sim 0.6$ and $2.1$ Gyr and masses of $10^{4}-10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$. We estimated the fraction of binary systems composed of two main-sequence stars and the fraction of candidate blue-straggler stars (BSSs). Moreover, we derived the structural parameters of the cluster, including the core radius, the central density, the mass function, and the total mass. We find that the fraction of binaries with a mass ratio larger than 0.7 ranges from $\sim$7%, in NGC1846, to $\sim$20%, in NGC2108. The radial and luminosity distribution can change from one cluster to another. However, when we combine the results from all the clusters, we find that binaries follow a flat radial trend and no significant correlation with the mass of the primary star. We find no evidence for a relation between the fractions of binaries and BSSs. We combined the results on binaries in the studied Magellanic Cloud clusters with those obtained for 67 Galactic globular clusters and 78 open clusters. We detect a significant anti-correlation between the binary fraction in the core and the mass of the host cluster. However, star clusters with similar masses exhibit a wide range of binary fractions. Conversely, there is no evidence of a correlation between the fraction of binaries and either the cluster age or the dynamic age.
#### Mapping the Galactic disk with the LAMOST and Gaia Red clump sample:  VIII: Mapping the kinematics of the Galactic disk using mono-age and  mono-abundance stellar populations

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study of the kinematic properties of the different Galactic disk populations, as defined by the chemical abundance ratios and stellar ages, across a large disk volume (4.5 $\leq$ R $\leq$ 15.0 kpc and $|Z|$ $\leq$ 3.0 kpc), by using the LAMOST-Gaia red clump sample stars. We determine the median velocities for various spatial and population bins, finding large-scale bulk motions, such as the wave-like behavior in radial velocity, the north-south discrepancy in azimuthal velocity and the warp signal in vertical velocity, and the amplitudes and spatial-dependences of those bulk motions show significant variations for different mono-age and mono-abundance populations. The global spatial behaviors of the velocity dispersions clearly show a signal of spiral arms and, a signal of the disk perturbation event within 4 Gyr, as well as the disk flaring in the outer region (i.e., $R \ge 12$ kpc) mostly for young or alpha-poor stellar populations. Our detailed measurements of age/[$\alpha$/Fe]-velocity dispersion relations for different disk volumes indicate that young/$\alpha$-poor populations are likely originated from dynamically heated by both giant molecular clouds and spiral arms, while old/$\alpha$-enhanced populations require an obvious contribution from other heating mechanisms such as merger and accretion, or born in the chaotic mergers of gas-rich systems and/or turbulent interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae are sources of powerful gravitational waves (GWs). We assess the possibility of extracting information about the equation of state (EOS) of high density matter from the GW signal. We use the bounce and early post-bounce signals of rapidly rotating supernovae. A large set of GW signals is generated using general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations for various EOS models. The uncertainty in the electron capture rate is parametrized by generating signals for six different models. To classify EOSs based on the GW data, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Even with the uncertainty in the electron capture rates, we find that the CNN models can classify the EOSs with an average accuracy of about 87 percent for a set of four distinct EOS models.

 - **Abstract**
 IRAS 15099-5856 in the young supernova remnant (SNR) MSH 15-52 is the first and only SNR-associated object with crystalline silicate dust detected so far, although its nature and the origin of the crystalline silicate are still unclear. In this paper, we present high-resolution mid-infrared (MIR) imaging observations of the bright central compact source IRS1 of IRAS 15099-5856 to study the spatial distributions of gas and dust and the analysis of its Spitzer MIR spectrum to explore the origin of IRS1. The MIR images obtained with the T-ReCS attached on the Gemini South telescope show a complicated, inhomogeneous morphology of IRS1 with bright clumps and diffuse emission in [Ne II] 12.81 $\mu$m and Qa 18.30 $\mu$m, which confirms that IRS1 is an extended source externally heated by the nearby O star Muzzio 10, a candidate for the binary companion of the progenitor star. The Spitzer MIR spectrum reveals several ionic emission lines including a strong [Ne II] 12.81 $\mu$m line, but no hydrogen line is detected. We model the spectrum using the photoionization code CLOUDY with varying elemental composition. The elemental abundance of IRS1 derived from the model is close to that of SN ejecta with depleted hydrogen and enhanced metals, particularly neon, argon, and iron. Our results imply that IRS1 originates from the SN ejecta and suggest the possibility of the formation of crystalline silicate in newly-formed SN dust.
#### Violent mass ejection by the progenitors of the brightest planetary  nebulae: supernova progenitors

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.15785
 - **Abstract**
 I examine the morphologies of the brightest planetary nebulae (PNe) in the Milky Way Galaxy and conclude that violent binary interaction processes eject the main nebulae of the brightest PNe. The typical morphologies of the brightest PNe are multipolar, namely have been shaped by two or more major jet-launching episodes at varying directions, and possess small to medium departures from pure point-symmetry. The departure from pure point-symmetry is generally not large. This suggests that triple-star interaction is not behind the mass ejection process, but rather a violent binary interaction. By violent interaction I refer to two or more energetic jet-launching episodes within a relatively short time (much shorter than the PN formation time). In particular, I suggest that the timescales of some interactions are shorter than the dynamical timescale of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) progenitor. I discuss some possibilities, including a rapid onset of the common envelope evolution (CEE) and the merger of the companion with the AGB core at the termination of the CEE. I suggest that the most likely companions to experience such interactions are white dwarfs (WDs). Some of these might actually be progenitors of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), as I suggest for SNR G1.9+0.3, the youngest SN Ia in the Galaxy. I speculate here on a positive correlation (but not one-to-one correspondence) between the brightest PNe and cases of CEE that end with WD-core merger, including progenitors of some SNe Ia.
#### Nobeyama Cygnus-X Survey: Physical Properties of C$^{18}$O clumps in  DR-6(W), DR-9 and DR-13S regions

 - **Abstract**
 Cygnus-X is considered a region of interest for high-energy astrophysics, since the Cygnus OB2 association has been confirmed as a PeVatron in the Cygnus cocoon. In this research note, we present new high-resolution (16'') $^{12,13}$CO(J=1$\rightarrow$0) and C$^{18}$O (J=1$\rightarrow$0) observations obtained with the Nobeyama 45-m radiotelescope, to complement the Nobeyama Cygnus-X Survey. We discovered 19 new C$^{18}$O clumps associated with the star-forming regions DR-6W, DR-9, and DR13S. We present the physical parameters of these clumps, which are consistent with the neighboring covered regions. We confirm the clumpy nature of these regions and of a filament located between DR6 and DR6W. These results strongly suggest that star formation occurs in these regions with clumps of sizes $\sim$10$^{-1}$ pc, masses $\sim$10$^2$ M$_\odot$, and H$_2$ densities of $\sim$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$.
#### A Fermi-LAT Study of Globular Cluster Dynamical Evolution in Milky Way  Galaxy: Millisecond Pulsars as the Probe

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.15859
 - **Abstract**
 Using archival {\it Fermi}-LAT data with a time span of $\sim12$ years, we study the population of Millisecond Pulsars (MSPs) in Globular Clusters (GlCs) and investigate their dependence on cluster dynamical evolution in the Milky Way Galaxy. We show that the $\gamma$-ray luminosity ($L_{\gamma}$) and emissivity ($\epsilon_{\gamma}=L_{\gamma}/M$) are good indicators of the population and abundance of MSPs in GlCs, and they are highly dependent on the dynamical evolution history of the host clusters. Specifically speaking, the dynamically older GlCs with more compact structures are more likely to have larger $L_{\gamma}$ and $\epsilon_{\gamma}$, and these trends can be summarized as strong correlations with cluster stellar encounter rate $\Gamma$ and the specific encounter rate ($\Lambda=\Gamma/M$), with $L_{\gamma}\propto \Gamma^{0.70\pm0.11}$ and $\epsilon_{\gamma}\propto \Lambda^{0.73\pm0.13}$ for dynamically normal GlCs. However, as GlCs evolve into deep core collapse, these trends are found to be reversed, implying that strong encounters may have lead to the ejection of MSPs from core-collapsed Systems. Besides, the GlCs are found to exhibit larger $\epsilon_{\gamma}$ with increasing stellar mass function slope, decreasing tidal radius and distances from the Galactic Center (GC). These correlations indicate that, as GlCs losing kinetic energy and spiral in towards GC, tidal stripping and mass segregation have a preference in leading to the loss of normal stars from GlCs, while MSPs are more likely to concentrate to cluster center and be deposited into the GC. Moreover, we gauge $\epsilon_{\gamma}$ of GlCs is $\sim10-1000$ times larger than the Galactic bulge, the latter is thought to reside thousands of unresolved MSPs and may responsible for the GC $\gamma$-ray excess, which support that GlCs are generous contributors to the population of MSPs in the GC.
#### The distribution, kinematics and luminosities of extreme helium stars as  probes of their origin and evolution

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.15869
 - **Abstract**
 Hydrogen deficient stars include the cool R CrB variable (RCBs) and hydrogen-deficient carbon (HdCs) giants through extreme helium stars (EHes) to the very hot helium-rich subdwarfs (He-sdO and O(He) stars) and white dwarfs. With surfaces rich in helium, nitrogen and carbon, their origins have been identified with the merger of two white dwarfs. Using Gaia to focus on the EHes, we aim to identify progenitor populations and test the evolution models. Gaia DR3 measurements and ground-based radial velocities have been used to compute Galactic orbits using galpy. Each orbit has been classified by population; EHe stars are found in all of the thin disk, thick disk, halo and bulge, as are RCB, HdC and He-sdO stars. Spectral energy distributions were constructed for all EHes, to provide angular diameters, and hence radii and luminosities. The EHes fall into two luminosity groups divided at L ~ 2500 solar L. This supports theory for the origin of EHes, and is the strongest confirmation so far in terms of luminosity. The lower luminosity EHes correspond well with the post-merger evolution of a double helium white dwarf binary. Likewise, the higher luminosity EHes match the post-merger evolution of a carbon/oxygen plus helium white dwarf binary. In terms of parent populations, current models predict that double white dwarf mergers should occur in all Galactic populations, but favour mergers arising from recent star formation (i.e. thin disk), whereas the statistics favour an older epoch (i.e. thick disk).
#### A New 2D Energy Balance Model For Simulating the Climates of Rapidly-  and Slowly-Rotating Terrestrial Planets

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.15992
 - **Abstract**
 Energy balance models (EBMs), alongside radiative-convective climate models (RCMs) and global climate models (GCMs), are useful tools for simulating planetary climates. Historically, planetary and exoplanetary EBMs have solely been 1D latitudinally-dependent models with no longitudinal dependence, until the study of Okuya et al., which focused on simulating synchronously-rotating planets. Following the work of Okuya et al., I have designed the first 2D EBM (PlaHab) that can simulate N2-CO2-H2O-H2 atmospheres of both rapidly-rotating and synchronously-rotating planets, including Mars, Earth, and exoplanets located within their circumstellar habitable zones. PlaHab includes physics for both water and CO2 condensation. Regional topography can be incorporated. Here, I have specifically applied PlaHab to investigate present Earth, early Mars, TRAPPIST-1e and Proxima Centauri b, representing examples of habitable (and potentially habitable) worlds in our solar system and beyond. I compare my EBM results against those of other 1D and 3D models, including those of the recent Trappist-1 Habitable Atmosphere (THAI) comparison project. Overall, EBM results are consistent with those of other 1D and 3D models although inconsistencies among all models continue to be related to the treatment of clouds and other known differences between EBMs and GCMs, including heat transport parameterizations. Although two-dimensional EBMs are a relatively new entry in the study of planetary/exoplanetary climates, their ease-of-use, speed, flexibility, wide applicability, and greater complexity (relative to 1D models), may indicate an ideal combination for the modeling of planetary and exoplanetary atmospheres alike.
