 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter self-interactions may have the capability to solve or at least mitigate small-scale problems of the cosmological standard model, {\Lambda}CDM. There are a variety of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models that lead to distinguishable astrophysical predictions and hence varying success in explaining observations. Studies of dark matter (DM) density cores on various mass scales suggest a velocity-dependent scattering cross-section. In this work we investigate how a velocity dependence alters the evolution of the DM distribution for frequent DM scatterings and compare to the velocity-independent case. We demonstrate that these cases are qualitatively different using a test problem. Moreover, we study the evolution of the density profile of idealised DM haloes and find that a velocity dependence can lead to larger core sizes and different time scales of core formation and core collapse. In cosmological simulations, we investigate the effect of velocity-dependent self-interaction on haloes and satellites in the mass range of $\approx 10^{11} - 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$. We study the abundance of satellites, density and shape profiles and try to infer qualitative differences between velocity-dependent and velocity-independent scatterings as well as between frequent and rare self-interactions. We find that a strongly velocity-dependent cross-section can significantly amplify the diversity of rotation curves, independent of the angular dependence of the differential cross-section. We further find that the abundance of satellites in general depends on both the velocity dependence and the scattering angle, although the latter is less important for strongly velocity-dependent cross-sections.

 - **Abstract**
 High resolution spectra with iSHELL on IRTF in the K and M band of the young, heavily accreting B 1.5e star MWC297 show numerous double-peaked CO lines. These CO lines originate in an inclined gaseous disk in Keplerian rotation. MWC297 is the only early B star known to show a Keplerian disk in CO. Analysis of the spectra show that 12CO 1 - 0 is optically thick for the low excitation lines. Even the 13CO 1 - 0 and 12CO 2 - 1 have somewhat optically thick lines at low J levels. We find that the CO emission in the disk can be fitted with CO being in a narrow ring at a radius of 12 AU, with a temperature of 1500 K, and a CO column density of 1.6 e18 cm-2. This model underestimates the line strength of high J lines, indicating that they are excited by fluorescence. The CO overtone lines have a similar temperature, The 13CO lines are much brighter than expected from interstellar isotope ratios. The 13CO lines are wider than the 12CO ones suggesting different excitation conditions. The same is true for 12CO 2 - 1. We see strong absorption in 12CO and 13CO 1 - 0 at low J levels, which is due to two two cold foreground clouds. These clouds, one with a temperature of 8.3 K and a column density of 6.7 e17 cm-2, and the other one colder and with lower column density, can fully account for the observed extinction toward MWC297.

 - **Abstract**
 Since self-gravity is crucial in the structure formation of the universe, many hydrodynamics simulations with the effect of self-gravity have been conducted. The multigrid method is widely used as a solver for the Poisson equation of the self-gravity; however, the parallelization efficiency of the multigrid method becomes worse when we use a massively parallel computer, and it becomes inefficient with more than $10^4$ cores, even for highly tuned codes. To perform large-scale parallel simulations ($> 10^4$ cores), developing a new gravity solver with good parallelization efficiency is beneficial. In this article, we develop a new self-gravity solver using the telegraph equation with a damping coefficient, $\kappa$. Parallelization is much easier than the case of the elliptic Poisson equation since the telegraph equation is a hyperbolic partial differential equation. We analyze convergence tests of our telegraph equations solver and determine that the best non-dimensional damping coefficient of the telegraph equations is $\tilde{\kappa} \simeq 2.5$. We also show that our method can maintain high parallelization efficiency even for massively parallel computations due to the hyperbolic nature of the telegraphic equation by weak-scaling tests. If the time step of the calculation is determined by heating/cooling or chemical reactions, rather than the CFL condition, our method may provide the method for calculating self-gravity faster than other previously known methods such as the fast Fourier transform and multigrid iteration solvers because gravitational phase velocity determined by the CFL condition using these timescales is much larger than the fluid velocity plus sound speed.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the derivation of rate coefficients for the rotational (de-)excitation of PO$^+$ induced by collisions with H$_2$. The calculations were performed on a four-dimensional potential energy surface, obtained on top of highly accurate $ab$ $initio$ energy points. Preliminary tests pointed out the low influence of the coupling between $j=0$ and the higher rotational levels of H$_2$ on the cross sections values, thus allowing to neglect the rotational structure of H$_2$. On this basis, state-to-state collisional rate coefficients were derived for temperatures ranging from 5 to 200 K. Radiative transfer calculations have been used to model the recent observation of PO$^+$ in the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud, in order to evaluate the possible impact of non-LTE models on the determination of its physical conditions. The derived column density was found to be approximately $\sim 3.7\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$, which is 60\% (a factor of $\sim 1.7$) smaller than the previously LTE-derived value. Extensive simulations show that PO$^+$ low-$j$ rotational lines exhibit maser behavior at densities between $10^4$ and $10^6$ cm$^{-3}$, thus highlighting the importance of a proper treatment of the molecular collisions to accurately model PO$^+$ emissions in the interstellar medium.
#### An SiO Toroid and Wide-angle Outflow associated with the Massive  Protostar W75N(B)-VLA2

 - **Abstract**
 We have carried out ALMA observations of the massive star-forming region W75N(B), which contains the massive protostars VLA1, VLA2, and VLA3. Particularly, VLA2 is an enigmatic protostar associated with a wind-driven H$_2$O maser shell, which has evolved from an almost isotropic outflow to a collimated one in just 20 years. The shell expansion seemed to be halted by an obstacle located to the northeast of VLA2. Here we present our findings from observing the 1.3~mm continuum and H$_2$CO and SiO emission lines. Within a region of ~30" (~39,000 au) diameter, we have detected 40 compact mm-continuum sources, three of them coinciding with VLA1, VLA2, and VLA3. While the H$_2$CO emission is mainly distributed in a fragmented structure around the three massive protostars, but without any of the main H$_2$CO clumps spatially coinciding with them, the SiO is highly concentrated on VLA2, indicating the presence of very strong shocks generated near this protostar. The SiO emission is clearly resolved into an elongated structure (~ 0.6"*0.3"; ~780 au * 390 au) perpendicular to the major axis of the wind-driven maser shell. The structure and kinematics of the SiO emission are consistent with a toroid and a wide-angle outflow surrounding a central mass of ~10 Msun, thus supporting previous theoretical predictions regarding the evolution of the outflow. Additionally, we have identified the expected location and estimated the gas density of the obstacle that is hindering the expansion of the maser shell.
#### Time-Variable Diffuse $γ$-ray Foreground

 - **Abstract**
 While the data analysis of $\gamma$-ray telescopes has now become more robust, some signals may be misinterpretations of a time-variable foreground emission from the Solar System, induced by low-energy cosmic-ray interactions with asteroids. Our goal is to provide emission templates for this time-variable diffuse $\gamma$-ray foreground by considering the populations of Main Belt Asteroids, Jovian and Neptunian Trojans, Kuiper Belt Objects, and the Oort Cloud. We model the spatial distribution of all known asteroids by performing 3D-fits to determine their density profiles and calculate their appearances by line-of-sight integrations. Because Earth and the asteroids are moving with respect to each other, we obtain diffuse emission templates varying on timescales of days to decades. We find that the temporal variability can lead to flux enhancements which may mimic emission features unless properly taken into account. This variation is further enhanced by the Solar cycle as the cosmic-ray spectrum is attenuated by the Solar modulation potential, leading to a relative flux increase of the outer asteroids. The cumulative effect of the time-dependent emission is illustrated for the case of the 511 keV OSSE fountain, and for emission features near the Galactic Centre, both being possible misinterpretations of the Solar System albedo. We recommend that $\gamma$-ray data analyses should always take into account the possibility of a time-variable foreground. Due to the ecliptic overlap with the Galactic plane, the Galactic emission is expected to be weaker by 0.1-20%, depending on time (relative planetary motion), energy, and Solar cycle, which has immense consequences for the interpretation of dark matter annihilation cross sections, cosmic-ray spectra and amplitudes, as well as nucleosynthesis yields and related parameters.
#### Modelling Non-Condensing Compositional Convection for Applications to  Super-Earth and Sub-Neptune Atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 Compositional convection is atmospheric mixing driven by density variations caused by compositional gradients. Previous studies have suggested that compositional gradients of atmospheric trace species within planetary atmospheres can impact convection and the final atmospheric temperature profile. In this work, we employ 3D convection resolving simulations using Cloud Model 1 (CM1) to gain a fundamental understanding of how compositional variation influences convection and the final atmospheric state of exoplanet atmospheres. We perform 3D initial value problem simulations of non-condensing compositional convection for Earth-Air, $\rm H_2$, and $\rm CO_2$ atmospheres. Conventionally, atmospheric convection is assumed to mix the atmosphere to a final, marginally stable state defined by a unique temperature profile. However, when there is compositional variation within an atmosphere, a continuous family of stable end states is possible, differing in the final state composition profile. Our CM1 simulations are used to determine which of the family of possible compositional end states is selected. Leveraging the results from our CM1 simulations, we develop a dry convective adjustment scheme for use in General Circulation Models (GCMs). This scheme relies on an energy analysis to determine the final adjusted atmospheric state. Our convection scheme produces results that agree with our CM1 simulations and can easily be implemented in GCMs to improve modelling of compositional convection in exoplanet atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 Planets grow in rotating disks of dust and gas around forming stars, some of which can subsequently collide in giant impacts after the gas component is removed from the disk. Monitoring programs with the warm Spitzer mission have recorded significant and rapid changes in mid-infrared output for several stars, interpreted as variations in the surface area of warm dusty material ejected by planetary-scale collisions and heated by the central star: e.g., NGC 2354-ID8, HD 166191 and V844 Persei. Here we report combined observations of the young (about 300 Myr), solar-like star ASASSN-21qj: an infrared brightening consistent with a blackbody temperature of 1000 K and a luminosity of 4 percent of that of the star lasting for about 1000 days, partially overlapping in time with a complex and deep wavelength-dependent optical eclipse that lasted for about 500 days. The optical eclipse started 2.5 years after the infrared brightening, implying an orbital period of at least that duration. These observations are consistent with a collision between two exoplanets of several to tens of Earth masses at 2 to 16 au from the central star. Such an impact produces a hot, highly-extended post-impact remnant with sufficient luminosity to explain the infrared observations. Transit of the impact debris, sheared by orbital motion into a long cloud, causes the subsequent complex eclipse of the host star.
