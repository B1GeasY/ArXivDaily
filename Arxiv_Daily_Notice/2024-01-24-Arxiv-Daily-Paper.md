 - **Abstract**
 We report precise radial velocity (RV) observations of HD 212657 (= K2-167), a star shown by K2 to host a transiting sub-Neptune-sized planet in a 10 day orbit. Using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry, we refined the planet parameters, especially the orbital period. We collected 74 precise RVs with the HARPS-N spectrograph between August 2015 and October 2016. Although this planet was first found to transit in 2015 and validated in 2018, excess RV scatter originally limited mass measurements. Here, we measure a mass by taking advantage of reductions in scatter from updates to the HARPS-N Data Reduction System (2.3.5) and our new activity mitigation method called CCF Activity Linear Model (CALM), which uses activity-induced line shape changes in the spectra without requiring timing information. Using the CALM framework, we performed a joint fit with RVs and transits using EXOFASTv2 and find $M_p = 6.3_{-1.4}^{+1.4}$ $M_{\oplus}$ and $R_p = 2.33^{+0.17}_{-0.15}$ $R_{\oplus}$, which places K2-167 b at the upper edge of the radius valley. We also find hints of a secondary companion at a $\sim$ 22 day period, but confirmation requires additional RVs. Although characterizing lower-mass planets like K2-167 b is often impeded by stellar variability, these systems especially help probe the formation physics (i.e. photoevaporation, core-powered mass loss) of the radius valley. In the future, CALM or similar techniques could be widely applied to FGK-type stars, help characterize a population of exoplanets surrounding the radius valley, and further our understanding of their formation.
#### Multi-energy diffuse neutrino fluxes originating from core-collapse  supernovae

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12403
 - **Abstract**
 A comprehensive framework is proposed for the diffuse neutrino fluxes attributed to two different physical processes in core collapse of massive stars. In this scheme, models of thermal MeV-scale neutrinos produced at the core of collapsing stars and non-thermal high-energy neutrinos emitted from accelerated cosmic rays interacting with circumstellar material are bridged through features of core-collapse supernovae (progenitor mass and optical properties). The calculated diffuse fluxes are presented with discussion about their detection prospects at neutrino telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 From Nov. 2019 to May 2020, the red supergiant star Betelgeuse experienced an unprecedented drop of brightness in the visible domain called the great dimming event. Large atmospheric dust clouds and large photospheric convective features are suspected to be responsible for it. To better understand the dimming event, we used mid-infrared long-baseline spectro-interferometric measurements of Betelgeuse taken with the VLTI/MATISSE instrument before (Dec. 2018), during (Feb. 2020), and after (Dec. 2020) the GDE. We present data in the 3.98 to 4.15\,$\mu$m range to cover SiO spectral features molecules as well as adjacent continuum. We have employed geometrical models, image reconstruction, as well as radiative transfer models to monitor the spatial distribution of SiO over the stellar surface. We find a strongly in-homogeneous spatial distribution of SiO that appears to be looking very different between our observing epochs, indicative of a vigorous activity in the stellar atmosphere. The contrast of our images is small in the pseudo-continuum for all epochs, implying that our MATISSE observations support both cold spot and dust cloud model.

 - **Abstract**
 The hot subdwarf O/B stars (sdO/Bs) are known as extreme horizontal branch stars, which is of great importance in stellar evolution theory. The sdO/Bs are generally thought to have a helium-burning core and a thin hydrogen envelope $(M_{\rm env }<0.02M_\odot)$. In the canonical binary evolution scenario, sdO/Bs are considered to be the stripped cores of red giants. However, such a scenario cannot explain the recently discovered sdO/B binary, SMSS J1920, where the strong Ca H$\&$K lines in the spectrum are found. It suggests that this binary is likely originated from the recent ejection of common envelope (CE). In this {work}, we proposed a new formation channel of massive sdO/Bs, namely sdO/Bs produced from a CE ejection process with an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star (hereafter AGB CE channel). We constructed the evolutionary model of sdO/Bs and successfully explained most of the important observed parameters of the sdO/B star in SMSS J1920, including the evolutionary age, sdO/B mass, effective temperature, surface gravity and surface helium abundance. The minimum sdO/B mass produced from the AGB CE channel is about $0.48M_\odot$. The evolutionary tracks in $\log T_{\rm eff}-\log g$ plane {may explain a fraction of the observational samples} with high-$\log T_{\rm eff}$ and low-$\log g$. Considering wind mass-loss of sdO/Bs, the model could produce helium-rich hot subdwarfs with $\log (n_{\rm He}/n_{\rm H})\gtrsim-1$.

 - **Abstract**
 We report 850 $\mu$m continuum polarization observations toward the filamentary high-mass star-forming region NGC 2264, taken as part of the B-fields In STar forming Regions Observations (BISTRO) large program on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). These data reveal a well-structured non-uniform magnetic field in the NGC 2264C and 2264D regions with a prevailing orientation around 30 deg from north to east. Field strengths estimates and a virial analysis for the major clumps indicate that NGC 2264C is globally dominated by gravity while in 2264D magnetic, gravitational, and kinetic energies are roughly balanced. We present an analysis scheme that utilizes the locally resolved magnetic field structures, together with the locally measured gravitational vector field and the extracted filamentary network. From this, we infer statistical trends showing that this network consists of two main groups of filaments oriented approximately perpendicular to one another. Additionally, gravity shows one dominating converging direction that is roughly perpendicular to one of the filament orientations, which is suggestive of mass accretion along this direction. Beyond these statistical trends, we identify two types of filaments. The type-I filament is perpendicular to the magnetic field with local gravity transitioning from parallel to perpendicular to the magnetic field from the outside to the filament ridge. The type-II filament is parallel to the magnetic field and local gravity. We interpret these two types of filaments as originating from the competition between radial collapsing, driven by filament self-gravity, and the longitudinal collapsing, driven by the region's global gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 The first generation metal free stars, referred to as population III (Pop III) stars, are believed to be the first objects to form out of the pristine gas in the very early Universe. Pop III stars have different structures from the current generation of stars and are important for generating heavy elements and shaping subsequent star formation. However, it is very challenging to directly detect Pop III stars given their high redshifts and short lifetimes. In this paper, we propose a novel signature for detecting Pop III stars through their tidal disruption events (TDEs) by massive black holes. We model the emission properties and calculate the expected rates for these unique TDEs in the early Universe at z ~ 10. We find that Pop III star TDEs have much higher mass fallback rates compared to normal TDEs in the local universe and are therefore rather luminous, rendering them feasible for detection. They also have very long observed flare evolution timescale, making it more likely to detect such TDEs during their rising phase. We further demonstrate that a large fraction of the TDE emissions are redshifted to infrared wavelengths and can be detected by the James Webb Space Telescope and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Lastly, the TDE rate sensitively depends on the black hole mass function in the early Universe. We find a promising Pop III star TDE detection rate of up to a few tens per year using the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 Type II Cepheids (T2C) are less frequently used counterparts of classical Cepheids which provide the primary calibration of the distance ladder for measuring $H_0$ in the local Universe. In the era of the Hubble Tension, T2C variables with the RR Lyrae stars (RRL) and the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) can potentially provide classical Cepheid independent calibration of the cosmic distance ladder. Our goal is to provide an absolute calibration of the Period-Luminosity, Period-Luminosity-Color and Period-Wesenheit relations(PL,PLC and PW) of T2Cs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We exploited time-series photometry in the near-infrared (NIR) bands for a sample of more than 320 T2Cs in the Magellanic Clouds (MC). These observations were acquired during 2009-2018 in the context of the VMC ESO public survey (The VISTA near-infrared YJKs survey of the Magellanic System). The NIR photometry was supplemented with well-sampled optical light curves and accurate pulsation periods from the OGLE IV survey and the Gaia mission. We used the best-quality NIR light curves to generate custom templates for modelling sparsely sampled light curves in YJKs bands; in turn, we derived accurate and precise intensity-averaged mean magnitudes and pulsation amplitudes of 339 T2Cs in the MC. We used optical and NIR mean magnitudes to derive PL/PLC/PW relations for T2Cs in multiple bands, which were calibrated with the geometric distance to the LMC and with the Gaia parallaxes. We used our new empirical calibrations of PL/PW relations to obtain distances to 22 T2C-host Galactic globular clusters, which were found to be systematically smaller by 0.1 mag and 0.03-0.06 mag compared with the literature. A better agreement is found between our distances and those based on RRLs in globular clusters, providing strong support for using these population II stars with the TRGB for future distance scale studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The theory of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, coupled with an estimate of the primordial deuterium abundance (D/H)_pr, offers insights into the baryon density of the Universe. Independently, the baryon density can be constrained during a different cosmological era through the analysis of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy. The comparison of these estimates serves as a rigorous test for the self-consistency of the Standard Cosmological Model and stands as a potent tool in the quest for new physics beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics. For a meaningful comparison, a clear understanding of the various systematic errors affecting deuterium measurements is crucial. Given the limited number of D/H measurements, each new estimate carries significant weight. This study presents the detection of DI absorption lines in a metal-poor sub-Damped Lyman-alpha system ([O/H]=-1.71+-0.02, logN(HI)=19.304+-0.004) at z_abs=3.42 towards the quasar J1332+0052. Through simultaneous fitting of HI and DI Lyman-series lines, as well as low-ionization metal lines, observed at high spectral resolution and high signal-to-noise using VLT/UVES and Keck/HIRES, we derive log(DI/HI)=-4.622+-0.014, accounting for statistical and systematic uncertainties of 0.008dex and 0.012dex, respectively. Thanks to negligible ionization corrections and minimal deuterium astration at low metallicity, this D/H ratio provides a robust measurement of the primordial deuterium abundance, consistent and competitive with previous works. Incorporating all prior measurements, the best estimate of the primordial deuterium abundance is constrained as: (D/H)_pr=(2.533+-0.024)*10^-5. This represents a 5% improvement in precision over previous studies and reveals a moderate tension with the expectation from the Standard Model (~2.2sig). This discrepancy underscores the importance of further measurements in the pursuit of new physics.
#### An updated modular set of synthetic spectral energy distributions for  young stellar objects

 - **Abstract**
 Measured properties of young stellar objects (YSOs) are key tools for research into pre-main-sequence stellar evolution. YSO properties are commonly measured by comparing observed radiation to existing grids of template YSO spectral energy distributions (SEDs) calculated by radiative transfer. These grids are often sampled and constructed using simple models of mass assembly/accretion over time. However, because we do not yet have a complete theory of star formation, the choice of model sets the tracked parameters and range of allowed values. By construction, then, the assumed model limits the measurements that can be made using the grid. Radiative transfer models not constrained by specific accretion histories would enable assessment of a wider range of theories. We present an updated version of the Robitaille (2017) set of YSO SEDs, a collection of models with no assumed evolutionary theory. We outline our newly calculated properties: envelope mass, weighted-average dust temperature, disk stability, and circumstellar $A_{\rm V}$. We also convolve the SEDs with new filters, including JWST, and provide users the ability to perform additional convolutions. We find a correlation between the average temperature and millimeter-wavelength brightness of optically thin dust in our models and discuss its ramifications for mass measurements of pre- and protostellar cores. We also compare the positions of YSOs of different observational classes and evolutionary stages in IR color space and use our models to quantify the extent to which class and stage may be confused due to observational effects. Our updated models are released to the public.
#### Detection and chemical modelling of complex prebiotic molecule cyanamide  in the hot molecular core G31.41+0.31

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12879
 - **Abstract**
 In the interstellar medium (ISM), the complex prebiotic molecule cyanamide (NH$_{2}$CN) plays a key role in producing adenine (C$_{5}$H$_{5}$N$_{5}$), purines (C$_{5}$H$_{4}$N$_{4}$), pyrimidines (C$_{4}$H$_{4}$N$_{2}$), and other biomolecules via a series of reactions. Therefore, studying the emission lines of NH$_{2}$CN is important for understanding the hypothesis of the pre-solar origin of life in the universe. We present the detection of the rotational emission lines of NH$_{2}$CN with vibrational states $v$ = 0 and 1 towards the hot molecular core G31.41+0.31 using the high-resolution twelve-meter array of Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) band 3. The estimated column density of NH$_{2}$CN towards G31.41+0.31 using the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model is (7.21$\pm$0.25)$\times$10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ with an excitation temperature of 250$\pm$25 K. The abundance of NH$_{2}$CN with respect to H$_{2}$ towards G31.41+0.31 is (7.21$\pm$1.46)$\times$10$^{-10}$. The NH$_{2}$CN and NH$_{2}$CHO column density ratio towards G31.41+0.31 is 0.13$\pm$0.02. We compare the estimated abundance of NH$_{2}$CN with that of other hot cores and corinos and observed that the abundance of NH$_{2}$CN towards G31.41+0.31 is nearly similar to that of the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1, the hot corinos IRAS 16293-2422 B, and NGC 1333 IRAS4A2. We compute the two-phase warm-up chemical model of NH$_{2}$CN using the gas-grain chemical code UCLCHEM, and after chemical modelling, we notice that the observed and modelled abundances are nearly similar. After chemical modelling, we conclude that the neutral-neutral reaction between NH$_{2}$ and CN is responsible for the production of NH$_{2}$CN on the grain surface of G31.41+0.31.

 - **Abstract**
 This review describes the dynamic phenomena in the atmosphere of Mars that are visible in images taken in the visual range through cloud formation and dust lifting. We describe the properties of atmospheric features traced by aerosols covering a large range of spatial and temporal scales, including dynamical interpretations and modelling when available. We present the areographic distribution and the daily and seasonal cycles of those atmospheric phenomena. We rely primarily on images taken by cameras on Mars Express.
#### Mapping dust in the giant molecular cloud Orion A

 - **Abstract**
 The Sun is located close to the Galactic mid-plane, meaning that we observe the Galaxy through significant quantities of dust. Moreover, the vast majority of the Galaxy's stars also lie in the disc, meaning that dust has an enormous impact on the massive astrometric, photometric and spectroscopic surveys of the Galaxy that are currently underway. To exploit the data from these surveys we require good three-dimensional maps of the Galaxy's dust. We present a new method for making such maps in which we form the best linear unbiased predictor of the extinction at an arbitrary point based on the extinctions for a set of observed stars. This method allows us to avoid the artificial inhomogeneities (so-called 'fingers of God') and resolution limits that are characteristic of many published dust maps. Moreover, it requires minimal assumptions about the statistical properties of the interstellar medium. In fact, we require only a model of the first and second moments of the dust density field. The method is suitable for use with directly measured extinctions, such as those provided by the Rayleigh-Jeans colour excess method, and inferred extinctions, such as those provided by hierarchical Bayesian models like StarHorse. We test our method by mapping dust in the region of the giant molecular cloud Orion A. Our results indicate a foreground dust cloud at a distance of 350 pc, which has been identified in work by another author.
