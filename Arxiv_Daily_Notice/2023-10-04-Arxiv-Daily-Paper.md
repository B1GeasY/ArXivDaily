 - **Abstract**
 We apply for the first time the Monte Carlo star cluster modeling method to study tidal tail and stellar stream formation from globular clusters, assuming a circular orbit in a smooth Galactic potential. Approximating energetically unbound bodies (potential escapers; PEs) as collisionless enables this fast but spherically symmetric method to capture asymmetric tidal phenomena with unprecedented detail. Beyond reproducing known stream features, including epicyclic overdensities, we show how 'returning tidal tails' may form after the stream fully circumnavigates the Galaxy back to the cluster, enhancing the stream's velocity dispersion. While a realistically clumpy, time-dependent Galactic potential may disrupt such tails, they warrant scrutiny as potentially excellent constraints on the Galactic potential's history and substructure. Re-examining the escape timescale $\Delta t$ of PEs, we find new behavior related to chaotic scattering in the three-body problem; the $\Delta t$ distribution features sharp plateaus corresponding to distinct locally smooth patches of the chaotic saddle separating the phase space basins of escape. We study for the first time $\Delta t$ in an evolving cluster, finding that $\Delta t\sim(E_{\rm J}^{-0.1},E_{\rm J}^{-0.4})$ for PEs with (low, high) Jacobi energy $E_{\rm J}$, flatter than for a static cluster ($E_{\rm J}^{-2}$). Accounting for cluster mass loss and internal evolution -- and (roughly) for ongoing relaxation among PEs -- lowers the median $\Delta t$ from ${\sim}10\,$Gyr to ${\lesssim}100\,$Myr. We finally outline future improvements to escape physics in the Monte Carlo method intended to enable both the first large-parameter-space studies of tidal tail/stellar stream formation from full globular cluster simulations and detailed comparisons to stream observations.
#### Considering the Single and Binary Origins of the Type IIP SN 2017eaw

 - **Abstract**
 Current population synthesis modeling suggests that 30-50% of Type II supernovae originate from binary progenitors, however, the identification of a binary progenitor is challenging. One indicator of a binary progenitor is that the surrounding stellar population is too old to contain a massive single star.Measurements of the progenitor mass of SN 2017eaw are starkly divided between observations made temporally close to core-collapse which show a progenitor mass of 13-15 solar masses (final helium core mass of 4.4 to 6.0 solar masses - which is a more informative property than initial mass) and those from the stellar population surrounding the SN which find M<10.8 solar masses (helium core mass <3.4 solar masses). In this paper, we reanalyze the surrounding stellar population with improved astrometry and photometry, finding a median age of 16.8 (+3.2, -1.0) Myr for all stars younger than 50 Myr (helium core mass of 4.7 solar masses) and 85.9 (+3.2, -6.5) Myr for stars younger than 150 Myr. 16.8 Myr is now consistent with the helium core mass range derived from the temporally near explosion observations for single stars. Applying the combined constraints to population synthesis models, we determine that the probability of the progenitor of SN 2017eaw being an initially single-star is 65% compared to 35% for prior binary interaction. 85.9 Myr is inconsistent with any formation scenarios. We demonstrate that combining progenitor age constraints with helium core mass estimates from red supergiant SED modeling, late-time spectra, and indirectly from light curve modeling can help to differentiate single and binary progenitor scenarios and provide a framework for the application of this technique to future observations.
#### Extended Main-Sequence Turnoff and Red Clump in intermediate-age star  clusters: A study of NGC 419

 - **Abstract**
 With the goal of untangling the origin of extended main-sequence turnoffs (eMSTOs) and extended red clumps (eRCs) in star clusters, in this work we present the study of the intermediate-age cluster NGC 419, situated along the Bridge of the Small Magellanic Cloud. To this aim, we analyzed multi-epoch, high angular resolution observations acquired with the Hubble Space Telescope for this dynamically young cluster, which enabled the determination of precise proper motions and therefore the assessment of the cluster membership for each individual star in the field of view. With this unprecedented information at hand, we first studied the radial distribution of kinematically selected member stars in different eMSTO subregions. The absence of segregation supports the rotation scenario as the cause for the turnoff color extension and disfavors the presence of a prolonged period of star formation in the cluster. A similar analysis on the eRC of NGC 419 confirms the absence of segregation, providing further evidence against an age spread, which is at odds with previous investigations. Even so, the currently available evolutionary models including stellar rotation fail at reproducing the two photometric features simultaneously. We argue that either shortcomings in these models or a different origin for the red clump feature, such as a nonstandard differential mass loss along the red giant branch phase, are the only way to reconcile our observational findings with theoretical expectations.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the collapse of dense molecular cloud cores to stellar densities and the subsequent evolution of the protostar is of importance to model the feedback effects such an object has on its surrounding environment, as well as describing the conditions with which it enters the stellar evolutionary track. This process is fundamentally multi-scale and necessitates the use of robust numerical simulations. We aim to model the birth and early evolution of a low-mass protostar. We also seek to describe the interior structure of the protostar and the radiative behavior of its accretion shock front. We carry out a high resolution numerical simulation of the collapse of a gravitationally unstable $1$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ dense molecular cloud core to stellar densities using three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics under the gray flux-limited diffusion approximation. We follow the initial isothermal phase, the first adiabatic contraction, the second gravitational collapse triggered by the dissociation of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecules, and $\approx 247$ days of the subsequent main accretion phase. We find that the sub-critical radiative behavior of the protostar's shock front causes it to swell as it accretes matter. We also find that the protostar is turbulent from the moment of its inception despite its radiative stability. This turbulence causes significant entropy mixing inside the protostar, which regulates the swelling. Furthermore, we find that the protostar is not fully ionized at birth, but the relative amount of ionized material within it increases as it accretes matter from its surroundings. Finally, we report in the results of the first 3D calculations involving a frequency-dependent treatment of radiative transfer, which has not produced any major differences with its gray counterpart.

 - **Abstract**
 The superbubbles (SBs) carved in the interstellar medium by stellar winds and supernovae (SNe) are filled with hot ($T>$10$^{6}$~K) gas that produces soft X-ray emission (0.3-2.0\,keV). Models that assume a constant density medium and central SNe events fail to reproduce the soft X-ray luminosity that is observed in some SBs. We address this problem by generating models that trace the history of SNe in the SB and that produce off-centre SNe, that account for the missing soft X-ray emission. We test the models against archival, radio, optical, and X-ray observations of the SB DEM\,L50 located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The soft X-ray properties of DEM L50, including its high luminosity, makes it a perfect candidate to test our models. Furthermore, the multiple wave-band observations of this object will help us to assess how well our models can reproduce other SB properties beside its soft X-ray properties. We find that a configuration where DEM L50 forms at the edge of a filament reproduces the observed soft X-ray luminosity, optical morphology, shell velocity, and swept-up mass of neutral gas. This configuration is supported by IR observations of the LMC. In addition, we find that off-centre SNe, which enhance soft X-ray emission, naturally occur for all of the initial ambient conditions we tested in our models. Finally, we show that an off-centre SN can explain the observed soft X-ray luminosity of DEM L50, and that the resulting luminosity is consistent with a plasma in non-equilibrium ionisation.
#### The SOFIA FEEDBACK Legacy Survey: Rapid molecular cloud dispersal in RCW  79

 - **Abstract**
 It has long been discussed whether stellar feedback in the form of winds and/or radiation can shred the nascent molecular cloud, thereby controlling the star formation rate. However, directly probing and quantifying the impact of stellar feedback on the neutral gas of the nascent clouds is challenging. We present an investigation doing exactly that toward the RCW 79 HII region using the ionized carbon line at 158 $\mu$m ([CII]) from the FEEDBACK Legacy Survey. We combine this data with information on the dozen ionizing O stars responsible for the evolution of the region, and observe in [CII] for the first time both blue- and red-shifted mostly neutral high-velocity gas which reaches velocities up to 25 km s$^{-1}$ relative to the bulk emission of the molecular cloud. This high-velocity gas mostly contains neutral gas and partly forms a fragmented shell, similar to recently found shells in a few Galactic HII regions. However, this shell does not account for all of the observed neutral high-velocity gas. We also find high-velocity gas streaming out of the nascent cloud through holes and obtain a range of dynamical timescales below 1.0 Myr for the high-velocity gas which is well below the 2.3$\pm$0.5 Myr age of the OB cluster. This suggests a different scenario for the evolution of RCW 79, where the high-velocity gas is not solely stemming from a spherical expanding bubble, but also from gas recently ablated at the edge of the turbulent molecular cloud into the surrounding interstellar medium through low-pressure holes or chimneys. The resulting mass ejection rate estimate for the cloud is 0.9-3.5$\times$10$^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$, which leads to short erosion timescales, i.e. $<$5 Myr, for the nascent molecular cloud. This finding provides direct observational evidence of rapid molecular cloud dispersal.

 - **Abstract**
 Photoionization models frequently assume constant temperature or density within HII regions. We investigate this assumption by measuring the detailed temperature and density structures of four HII regions in the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Small Magellanic Cloud, using integral-field spectroscopic data from the Wide-Field Spectrograph on the ANU 2.3m telescope. We analyse the distribution of emission-lines of low-ionization species, intermediate-ionization species and high-ionization species. We present the complex electron temperature and density structures within HII regions. All four nebulae present a negative gradient in the electron density profile. Both positive and negative temperature gradients are observed in the nebulae. We create a series of nebula models with a constant ISM pressure and varying temperature and density distributions. Comparison of the line ratios between our HII regions and models suggests that none of the simple nebula models can reproduce the observed temperature and density structures. Comparison between the models and the data suggests that the ISM pressure of nebulae in LMC and SMC is between log(P/k)=6-7.5. Complex internal structures of the nebulae highlight the importance of future Monte-Carlo photoionization codes for accurate nebula modeling, which include a comprehensive consideration of arbitrary geometries of HII regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-High Energy (UHE, $>$0.1\,PeV) $\gamma$-ray Astronomy is rapidly evolving into an expanding branch of the $\gamma$-ray astronomy with the surprising discovery of 12 PeVatrons and the detection of a handful of photons above 1 PeV. Nearly all known celestial object types that have emissions in the TeV band are found also emitting UHE photons. UHE $\gamma$-rays have a well-defined horizon inside our galaxy due to the absorption of infrared and cosmic microwave backgrounds in the universe. With the last 30 years, traditional cosmic ray (CR) detection techniques allow the detection of UHE $\gamma$-rays, and opened up the last observation window. For leptonic sources, UHE radiation is in the deep Klein-Nishina regime which is largely suppressed. Therefore UHE $\gamma$-ray detection will help to locate and identify hadronic radiation sources, tracing the historic pursuit for the origin of CRs around the knee of the spectrum. The Crab Nebula is again the focus of attention with measured photon emissions above 1\,PeV. In the absence of hadronic processes, this may indicate the existence of an extreme accelerator of e$^+$/e$^-$. Utilization of the CR extensive air shower detection techniques broadens the field of view of the source observations, enabling the measurement of UHE radiation surrounding the sources. These observations can probe the particle propagation inside and outside the accelerators and the subsequent injection/escape into the interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 We use semi-analytical models to study the effects of primordial black hole (PBH) accretion on the cosmic radiation background during the epoch of reionization ($z\gtrsim 6$). We consider PBHs floating in the intergalactic medium (IGM), and located inside haloes, where star formation can occur. For stars with a mass $\gtrsim 25 \rm\ M_{\odot}$, formed in suitable host haloes, we assume they quickly burn out and form stellar remnant black holes (SRBHs). Since SRBHs also accrete material from their surroundings, we consider them to have similar radiation feedback as PBHs in the halo environment. To estimate the background radiation level more accurately, we take into account the impact of PBHs on structure formation, allowing an improved modeling of the halo mass function. We consider the radiation feedback from a broad suite of black holes: PBHs, SRBHs, high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We find that at $z\gtrsim 30$, the radiation background energy density is generated by PBHs accreting in the IGM, whereas at lower redshifts, the accretion feedback power from haloes dominates. We also analyze the total power density by modeling the accretion spectral energy distribution (SED), and break it down into select wavebands. In the UV band, we find that for $f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-3}$, the H-ionizing and Lyman-$\alpha$ fluxes from PBH accretion feedback do not violate existing constraints on the timing of reionization, and on the effective Wouthuysen-Field coupling of the 21-cm spin temperature of neutral hydrogen to the kinetic temperature of the IGM. However, in the X-ray band, with the same abundance, PBHs contribute significantly and could account for the unresolved part of the cosmic X-ray background.

 - **Abstract**
 It is an open issue how the surrounding environment of supernova remnant shocks affect nonthermal X-rays from accelerated electrons, with or without interacting dense material. We have conducted spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy of the shock-cloud interacting region of RCW 86 with XMM-Newton. It is found that bright soft X-ray filaments surround the dense cloud observed with 12CO and HI emission lines. These filaments are brighter in thermal X-ray emission, and fainter and possibly softer in synchrotron X-rays, compared to those without interaction. Our results show that the shock decelerates due to the interaction with clouds, which results in an enhancements of thermal X-ray emission. This could possibly also explain the softer X-ray synchrotron component, because it implies that those shocks that move through a low density environment, and therefore decelerate much less, can be more efficient accelerators. This is similar to SN 1006 and Tycho, and is in contrast to RX J1713.7-3946. This difference among remnants may be due to the clumpiness of dense material interacting with the shock, which should be examined with future observations.
#### A plausible link between dynamically unsettled molecular gas and the  radio jet in NGC 6328

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of outflowing molecular gas at the center of the nearby radio galaxy NGC6328 (z=0.014), which has a gigahertz-peaked spectrum radio core and a compact (2 pc) young double radio lobe tracing jet. Utilizing Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) CO(2-1) and CO(3-2) observations, as well as a novel code developed to fit the 3D gas distribution and kinematics, to study the molecular gas kinematics, we find that the bulk of the gas is situated within a highly warped disk structure, most likely the result of a past merger event. Our analysis further uncovers, within the inner regions of the gas distribution (R<300 pc) and at a position angle aligning with that of the radio jet (150 degrees), the existence of two anti-diametric molecular gas structures kinematically detached from the main disk. These structures most likely trace a jet-induced cold gas outflow with a total lower limit mass of $2\times 10^6\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ mass, corresponding to an outflow rate of $2\,\mathrm{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$ and a kinetic power of $2.7\times 10^{40}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$. The energy required to maintain such a molecular outflow is aligned with the mechanical power of the jet.
#### Neutrino Emissions of TXS 0506+056 caused by a Supermassive Binary Black  Hole Inspiral?

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube neutrino observatory detected two distinct flares of high-energy neutrinos from the direction of the blazar TXS 0506+056: a $\sim 300$ TeV single neutrino on September 22, 2017 and a $3.5\sigma$ signature of a dozen TeV neutrinos in 2014/2015. In a previous work, it was shown that these two episodes of neutrino emission could be due to an inspiral of a supermassive binary black hole (SMBBH) close to its merger at the core of TXS 0506+056. Such an inspiral can lead to quasi-periodic particle emission due to jet precession close to the final coalescence. This model made predictions on when the next neutrino emission episode must occur. On September 18, 2022, IceCube detected an additional, $\sim 170$ TeV neutrino in directional coincidence with the blazar TXS 0506+056, being consistent with the model prediction. Additionally, in April 2021, the Baikal Collaboration reported the detection of a $224\pm 75$ TeV neutrino, with TXS 0506+056 being in the uncertainty range of the event direction. We show that these four distinct flares of neutrino emission from TXS 0506+056 are consistent with a precessing jet scenario, driven by an inspiraling SMBBH. Using improved modeling, we are now able to constrain the total mass together with the mass ratio for the binary. We predict when the next neutrino flares from TXS 0506+056 should be happening. Finally, we estimate the detection potential of the Laser-interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) for the merger in the future.
#### Turbulent Structure In Supernova Remnants G46.8-0.3 And G39.2-0.3 From  THOR Polarimetry

 - **Abstract**
 We present the continued analysis of polarization and Faraday rotation for the supernova remnants (SNRs) G46.8-0.3 and G39.2-0.3 in L-band (1-2 GHz) radio continuum in The HI/OH/Recombination line (THOR) survey. In this work, we present our investigation of Faraday depth fluctuations from angular scales comparable to the size of the SNRs down to scales less than our 16" beam (<~0.7 pc) from Faraday dispersion (sigma_phi). From THOR, we find median sigma_phi of 15.9 +/- 3.2 rad m^-2 for G46.8-0.3 and 17.6 +/- 1.6 rad m^-2 for G39.2-0.3. When comparing to polarization at 6cm, we find evidence for sigma_phi >~ 30 rad m^-2 in localized regions where we detect no polarization in THOR. We combine Faraday depth dispersion with the rotation measure (RM) structure function (SF) and find evidence for a break in the SF on scales less than the THOR beam. We estimate the RM SF of the foreground interstellar medium (ISM) using the SF of extra-Galactic radio sources (EGRS) and pulsars to find that the RM fluctuations we measure originate within the SNRs for all but the largest angular scales.
