 - **Abstract**
 We present a high resolution chemical study of a representative sample of 21 luminous giant stars of Liller~1, a complex stellar system in the Galactic bulge, based on H band spectra acquired with the Near InfraRed Spectrograph at KeckII. 15 stars turn out to have a subsolar iron abundance and enhanced [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Al/Fe], likely old that formed early and quickly from gas mainly enriched by type~II supernovae, and 6 stars with supersolar iron and roughly solar-scaled [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Al/Fe], likely younger, thus formed at later epochs from gas also enriched by type~Ia supernovae. Moreover, both subpopulations show enhanced [N/Fe], as in the bulge field, about solar-scaled [V/Fe], and depletion of [C/Fe] and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C with respect to the solar values, indicating the occurrence of significant mixing in the stellar interiors of these evolved stars. The current study has also made evident that the sub-solar subpopulation shows some structuring, and the presence of a third subcomponent with iron content and [$\alpha$/Fe] enhancement somewhat intermediate between the metal-poor and metal-rich main subpopulations, has been statistically assessed, providing the chemical signature of an extended star formation with multiple bursts and of some self-enrichment.

 - **Abstract**
 Although there is strong evidence that many long GRBs are associated with the collapse of a massive star, tantalizing results in recent years have upended the direct association of {\em all} long GRBs with massive stars. In particular, kilonova signals in some long GRB light curves as well as a suggested uptick in the rate density of long GRBs at low redshifts (deviating significantly from the star formation rate) suggest that compact object mergers may be a non-negligible fraction of the long GRB population. Here we investigate the contribution of white dwarf-black hole mergers to the long GRB population. We present evidence for the deviation of the long GRB rate density from the star formation rate at low redshifts, and provide analytic and numerical arguments for why a white dwarf-black hole merger system may be a viable progenitor to explain this deviation. We show the range of parameter space in which the durations, energetics, and rates of these systems can account for a significant sub-population of low-redshift long GRBs.
#### An automated method for finding the most distant quasars

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming surveys such as Euclid, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope (Roman) will detect hundreds of high-redshift (z > 7) quasars, but distinguishing them from the billions of other sources in these catalogues represents a significant data analysis challenge. We address this problem by extending existing selection methods by using both i) Bayesian model comparison on measured fluxes and ii) a likelihood-based goodness-of-fit test on images, which are then combined using an Fbeta statistic. The result is an automated, reproduceable and objective high-redshift quasar selection pipeline. We test this on both simulations and real data from the cross-matched Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) catalogues. On this cross-matched dataset we achieve an AUC score of up to 0.795 and an F3 score of up to 0.79, sufficient to be applied to the Euclid, LSST and Roman data when available.
#### The Evolution of Protostellar Outflow Opening Angles and the Implications for the Growth of Protostars

 - **Abstract**
 We use 1-4" (300-1200 au) resolution 12CO(2-1) data from the MASSES (Mass Assembly of Stellar Systems and their Evolution with the SMA) project to measure the projected opening angles of 46 protostellar outflows in the Perseus Molecular Cloud, 37 of which are measured with sufficiently high confidence to use in further analysis. We find that there is a statistically significant difference in the distributions of outflow opening angles for Class 0 and Class I outflows, with a distinct lack of both wide-angle Class 0 outflows and highly collimated Class I outflows. Synthesizing our results with several previous studies, we find that outflows widen with age through the Class 0 stage but do not continue to widen in the Class I stage. The maximum projected opening angle reached is approximately 90 degrees +/- 20 degrees, with the transition between widening and remaining constant occurring near the boundary between the Class 0 and Class I phases of evolution. While the volume fractions occupied by these outflows are no more than a few tens of percent of the total core volume, at most, recent theoretical work suggests outflows may still be capable of playing a central role in setting the low star formation efficiencies of 25%-50% observed on core scales.
#### An Analytic Model of Gravitational Collapse Induced by Radiative Cooling: Instability Scale, Infall Velocity, and Accretion Rate

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analytic description of the spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of radiatively cooling gas clouds. The approach is based on developing the "one-zone" density-temperature relationship of the gas into a full dynamical model. We convert this density-temperature relationship into a barotropic equation of state, which we use to calculate the density and velocity profiles of the gas. From these quantities we calculate the time-dependent mass accretion rate onto the center of the cloud. The approach clarifies the mechanism by which radiative cooling induces gravitational instability. In particular, we distinguish the rapid, quasi-equilibrium contraction of a cooling gas core to high central densities from the legitimate instability this contraction establishes in the envelope. We develop a refined criterion for the mass scale of this instability, based only on the chemical-thermal evolution in the core. We explicate our model in the context of a primordial mini-halo cooled by molecular hydrogen, and then provide two further examples, a delayed collapse with hydrogen deuteride cooling and the collapse of an atomic cooling halo. In all three cases, our results agree well with full hydrodynamical treatments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed near-infrared study of an embedded cluster located in the hub of the giant molecular cloud G148.24+00.41 of mass $\sim$10$^5$ $M_\odot$, with the TANSPEC instrument mounted on the 3.6 m Devasthal Optical Telescope. The hub is located near the geometric center of the cloud and represents its most massive clump. We studied the central 2 pc $\times$ 2 pc area of the hub with 5$\sigma$ limiting magnitudes of 20.5, 20.1, and 18.6 mag in the $J$, $H$, and $K_s$ bands, respectively. Using the $K_s$-band luminosity function and comparing it with the synthetic clusters, we obtained the age of the cluster as $\sim$0.5 Myr, which was found to corroborate well with the visual extinction versus the age of nearby embedded clusters. We find that the present mass of the cluster is around $\sim$180 $M_\odot$, and the cluster is currently forming stars at a rate of $\sim$330 $M_\odot$ $\rm{Myr}^{-1}$, with an efficiency of $\sim$20%. The cluster is connected to an extended gas reservoir through a filamentary network; thus, we hypothesize that the cluster has the potential to become a richer cluster in a few Myr of time.
#### Generating ultra-compact neutron stars with bosonic dark matter

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we investigate the properties of neutron stars admixed with selfinteracting scalar bosonic dark matter. The dark matter interaction is described by a generalized $\phi^n$ power-law potential. We perform a stability analysis of these two-fluid objects by studying the onset of the unstable radial modes. We find ultra-compact neutron star-dark matter configurations where the neutron star matter is confined to a core radius of values below $7$ km which is unreachable for pure neutron stars. The total gravitational maximum mass of these ultra-compact configurations can have values of $3.4 \, M_\odot$. With our general ansatz of the power-law potential we show that the compactness of these solutions can be extreme, i.e. the compactness is $C = 1/3$ or even larger, making them compact enough to have a light-ring mimicking black holes. These ultra-compact objects are stable and possess a dark matter halo while having a hadronic matter core. With the addition of dark matter to neutron stars recent unusual mass-radius measurements of compact stars can be explained. We conclude that apparently contradictory measurements of neutron star masses and radii could be not only an indication of the presence of dark matter around a the hadronic matter core which is stabilized by the gravitational potential of dark matter but could also serve to disentangle the selfinteraction strength of dark matter. Our work points to a stiff equation of state for the dark matter fluid, rather than a soft one.
