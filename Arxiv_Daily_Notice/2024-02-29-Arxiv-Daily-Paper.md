 - **Abstract**
 Using the medium resolution spectrograph X-shooter, spectra of 235 OB and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in sub-solar metallicity environments have been secured. [...]This second paper focuses on the optical observations of 232 Magellanic Clouds targets. It describes the uniform reduction of the UVB (300 - 560 nm) and VIS (550 - 1020 nm) XShootU data as well as the preparation of advanced data products [...] . The data reduction of the raw data is based on the ESO CPL X-shooter pipeline. We paid particular attention to the determination of the response curves [...] We implemented slit-loss correction, absolute flux calibration, (semi-)automatic rectification to the continuum, and a correction for telluric lines. The spectra of individual epochs were corrected for the barycentric motion, re-sampled and co-added, and the spectra from the two arms were merged into a single flux calibrated spectrum covering the entire optical range with maximum signal-to-noise ratio. [...] We provide three types of data products: (i) two-dimensional spectra for each UVB and VIS exposure; (ii) one-dimensional UVB and VIS spectra before and after response-correction, as well as after applying various processing, including absolute flux calibration, telluric removal, normalisation and barycentric correction; and (iii) co-added flux-calibrated and rectified spectra over the full optical range, for which all available XShootU exposures were combined. For many of the targets, the final signal-to-noise ratio per resolution element is above 200 in both the UVB and the VIS co-added spectra. The reduced data and advanced scientific data products will be made available to the community upon publication of this paper. [...]

 - **Abstract**
 As well known, magnetic fields in space are distributed very inhomogeneously. Some-times field distributions have forms of filaments with high magnetic field values. As many ob-servations show, such a filamentation takes place in convective cells in the Sun and other astro-physical objects. This effect is associated with the frozenness of the magnetic field into a medium with high conductivity that leads to compression of magnetic field lines and forming magnetic filaments. We show analytically, based on the general analysis, that the magnetic field intensifies in the regions of downward flows in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional convective cells. These regions of the hyperbolic type for magnetic fields play a role of a specific attractor. This analysis was confirmed by numerical simulations for 2D convective cells of the roll-type. Without dissipation the magnetic field grows exponentially in time and does not depend on the aspect ratio between horizontal and vertical scale of the cell. An increase due to compression in the magnetic field in the high conductive plasma is saturated due to the natural limitation associated with dissipative effects when the maximum magnitude of the magnetic field is of the order of the root of the magnetic Reynolds number Rem. For the solar convective zone the mean kinetic energy density exceeds mean magnetic energy density at least for two orders of magnitude that allows one to use the kinematic approximation for the MHD induction equation. In this paper based on the stability analysis we explain why downward flows influence magnetic filaments from making them more flat with orientation along interfaces between convective cells.
#### Up around the bend: a multi-wavelength view of the quasar 3C 345

 - **Abstract**
 The flat-spectrum radio quasar 3C 345 has been showing gamma-ray activity since the mid-2000s along with activity across the electromagnetic spectrum. A gamma-ray burst in 2009 was successfully linked to relativistic outflow in 43 GHz VLBI observations and has since been analyzed also using single dish measurements. A multi-wavelength follow- up VLBI observation to the 2009 flare in conjunction with 43 GHz catalogue data from the VLBA-BU-BLAZAR and BEAM-ME programs are analyzed in this study in the context of the long-term evolution of the source. We aim to probe the innermost few milli-arcseconds of the ultracompact 3C 345 jet. In the process, we analyze the long-term kinematics of the inner jet and discuss the magnetic field morphology at different scales, as well as the origin of the gamma-ray emission. New observations at 23, 43, and 86 GHz took place on ten epochs between 2017 and 2019. We calibrate the 30 data sets using the rPicard pipeline, image them in Difmap and carry out polarization calibration using the GPCAL pipeline. We complement our VLBI data with ancillay VLBI maps at multiple frequencies, as well as 43 GHz observations carried out in the framework of the BEAM-ME and VLBA-BU-BLAZAR monitoring programs. We find multiple distinct component paths in the inner jet, forming a helical geometry. The helix is anchored at a stationary feature some 0.16 mas from the 43 GHz VLBI core and has a timescale of about 8 years. The characteristic bends in the jet morphology are caused by variations in the component ejection angle. We confirm the result of previous studies that the gamma-ray emission is produced (or caused) by relativistic outflow and violent interactions within the jet.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a novel deep learning framework, named SYMHnet, which employs a graph neural network and a bidirectional long short-term memory network to cooperatively learn patterns from solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field parameters for short-term forecasts of the SYM-H index based on 1-minute and 5-minute resolution data. SYMHnet takes, as input, the time series of the parameters' values provided by NASA's Space Science Data Coordinated Archive and predicts, as output, the SYM-H index value at time point t + w hours for a given time point t where w is 1 or 2. By incorporating Bayesian inference into the learning framework, SYMHnet can quantify both aleatoric (data) uncertainty and epistemic (model) uncertainty when predicting future SYM-H indices. Experimental results show that SYMHnet works well at quiet time and storm time, for both 1-minute and 5-minute resolution data. The results also show that SYMHnet generally performs better than related machine learning methods. For example, SYMHnet achieves a forecast skill score (FSS) of 0.343 compared to the FSS of 0.074 of a recent gradient boosting machine (GBM) method when predicting SYM-H indices (1 hour in advance) in a large storm (SYM-H = -393 nT) using 5-minute resolution data. When predicting the SYM-H indices (2 hours in advance) in the large storm, SYMHnet achieves an FSS of 0.553 compared to the FSS of 0.087 of the GBM method. In addition, SYMHnet can provide results for both data and model uncertainty quantification, whereas the related methods cannot.
#### A chemodynamical analysis of bright metal-poor stars from the HESP-GOMPA  survey -- Indications of a non-prevailing site for light r-process elements

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the detailed chemical abundances for a sample of 11 metal-poor, very metal-poor and extremely metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] = -1.65 to [Fe/H] = -3.0) as part of the HESP-GOMPA (Galactic survey Of Metal Poor stArs) survey. The abundance determinations encompass a range of elements, including C, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, and Ba, with a subset of the brighter objects allowing for the measurement of additional key elements. Notably, the abundance analysis of a relatively bright highly r-process-enhanced (r-II) star (SDSS J0019+3141) exhibits a predominantly main r-process signature and variations in the lighter r-process elements. Moreover, successful measurements of thorium in this star facilitate stellar age determinations. We find a consistent odd-even nucleosynthesis pattern in these stars, aligning with expectations for their respective metallicity levels, thus implicating Type II supernovae as potential progenitors. From the interplay between the light and heavy r-process elements, we infer a diminishing relative production of light r-process elements with increasing Type II supernova contributions, challenging the notion that Type II supernovae are the primary source of these light r-process elements in the early Milky Way. A chemodynamical analysis based on Gaia astrometric data and our derived abundances indicates that all but one of our program stars are likely to be of accreted origin. Additionally, our examination of alpha-poor stars underscores the occurrence of an early accretion event from a satellite on a prograde orbit, similar to that of the Galactic disc.
#### New method for estimating molecular cloud distances based on Gaia,  2MASS, and the TRILEGAL galaxy model

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17276
 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new method for estimating the distances of molecular clouds traced by CO line emission. Stars from 2MASS and Gaia EDR3 are selected as on-cloud stars when they are projected on a cloud. The background on-cloud stars have redder colors on average than the foreground stars. Instead of searching for stars projected away from the cloud, we employed the TRILEGA galaxy model to mimic the stellar population without cloud extinction along the sightline toward the cloud. Our method does not require an exact boundary of a cloud. The boundaries are highly variable and depend on the sensitivity of the molecular line data. For each cloud, we compared the distributions of on-cloud stars to the TRILEGAL stellar populations in the diagram of $J-K_s$ color versus distance. The intrinsic $J-K_s$ colors of main-sequence and evolved stars from TRILEGAL were considered separately, and they were used as the baseline for subtracting the observed $J-K_s$ colors. The baseline-corrected $J-K_s$ color was deployed with the Bayesian analysis and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to determine the distance at which the $J-K_s$ color jump is largest. This method was successfully applied to measure the distances of 27 molecular clouds, which were selected from previously published cloud samples. By replacing TRILEGAL with the GALAXIA galaxy model, we were able to measure the distances for 21 of the 27 clouds. The distances of the 21 clouds based on the GALAXIA model agree well with those based on the TRILEGAL model. The distances of the 27 clouds estimated by this method are consistent with previous estimates. We will apply this new method to a larger region of the gaseous galactic plane, in particular, for the inner galactic region, where a region free of CO emission is hard to separate from the crowded field of clouds.
#### The candidates of long-periodic variable sources in 6.7 GHz methanol  masers associated with four high-mass star-forming regions

 - **Abstract**
 Results of the long-term monitoring observations of the 6.7 GHz Class II methanol masers associated with the four high-mass star-forming regions by Hitachi 32-m radio telescope are presented. We detected periodic flux variability in G06.795-0.257, G10.472+0.027, G12.209-0.102, and G13.657-0.599 with the periods of 968, 1624, 1272, and 1266 d, respectively, although the detected period is tentative due to the short monitoring term relative to the estimated period. The facts that the flux variation patterns show the symmetric sine curves and that the luminosities of the central protostar and periods of maser flux variation are consistent with the expected period-luminosity (PL) relation suggest that the mechanisms of maser flux variability of G10.472+0.027 and G12.209-0.102 can be explained by protostellar pulsation instability. From the PL relation, central stars of these two sources are expected to be very high-mass protostars with a mass of 40 M and to have the mass accretion rate of 2*10-2 M yr-1. On the other hand, G06.795-0.257 and G13.657-0.599 have the intermittent variation patterns and have luminosities that are an order of magnitude smaller than those expected from PL relation, suggesting variation mechanisms of these sources originated from binary system. Since almost all the maser features vary with the same period regardless of its geometry, periodic accretion model may be appropriate mechanisms for flux variability in G06.795-0.257 and G13.657-0.599.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cygnus region, which contains massive molecular and atomic clouds and young stars, is a promising Galactic neutrino source candidate. Cosmic rays transport in the region can produce neutrinos and $\gamma$-rays. Recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) detected an ultrahigh-energy $\gamma$-ray bubble (Cygnus Bubble) in this region. Using publicly available track events detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory in 7 years of full detector operation, we conduct searches for correlated neutrino signals from the Cygnus Bubble with neutrino emission templates based on LHAASO $\gamma$-ray observations. No significant signals were found for any employed templates. With the 7 TeV $\gamma$-ray flux template, we set a flux upper limit of 90% confidence level (C.L.) for the neutrino emission from the Cygnus Bubble to be $5.7\times10^{-13}\, \mathrm{TeV}^{-1}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at 5 TeV.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Many barriers prevent dust to form planetesimals via coagulation in protoplanetary discs, such as bouncing, collisional fragmentation or aeolian erosion. Modelling dust and the different phenomena that can alter its evolution is therefore needed. Multiple solutions have been proposed, but still need to be confirmed. Aims: In this paper, we explore the role aeolian erosion plays in the evolution of dust. Methods: We use a monodisperse model to account for dust growth and fragmentation, implemented in a 1D model to compute the evolution of single grains and a 3D SPH code to compute the global evolution of dust and gas. We test the erosion model in our code and ensured it matches previous results. Results: With a model of disc reproducing observations, we show with both 1D and 3D studies that erosion is not significant during the evolution of dust when we take fragmentation into consideration. With a low-viscosity disc, fragmentation is less of a problem, but grain growth is also less important, preventing the formation of large objects anyway. In dust traps, close to the star, erosion is also not impactful, even when fragmentation is turned off. Conclusions: We show in this paper that aeolian erosion is negligible when radial drift, fragmentation and dust traps are taken into account and does not alter the dust evolution in the disc. However, it can have an impact on later stages, i.e. when the streaming instability forms large clumps close to the star, or when planetesimals are captured.
#### Collisional excitation of propyne (CH$_3$CCH) by He atoms

 - **Abstract**
 A detailed interpretation of the detected emission lines of environments in which propyne (or methyl acetylene, CH$_3$CCH) is observed requires a knowledge of its collisional rate coefficients with the most abundant species in the interstellar medium, He or H$_2$. We present the first three-dimensional potential energy surface (3D-PES) for the CH$_3$CCH-He molecular complex, study the dynamics of the collision, and report the first set of rate coefficients for temperatures up to 100 K for the collisional excitation of the lowest 60 ortho rotational levels and 60 para rotational levels of CH$_3$CCH by He atoms. We computed the 3D-PES with the explicitly correlated coupled-cluster with single-, double-, and perturbative triple-excitation method, in conjunction with the augmented correlation-consistent triple zeta basis set (CCSD(T)-F12a/aug-cc-pVTZ). The 3D-PES was fitted to an analytical function. Scattering computations of pure rotational (de-)excitation of CH$_3$CCH by collision with He atoms were performed and the state-to-state cross sections were computed using the close coupling method for total energies up to 100 cm$^{-1}$ and with the coupled states approximation at higher energy for both ortho and para symmetries of CH$_3$CCH. The PES obtained is caracterized by a large anisotropy and a potential well depth of 51.04 cm$^{-1}$. By thermally averaging the collisional cross sections, we determined quenching rate coefficients for kinetic temperatures up to 100 K. A strong even $\Delta j$ propensity rule at almost all collision energies exists for CH$_3$CCH-He complex. To evaluate the impact of rate coefficients in the analysis of observations, we carried out non-LTE radiative transfer computations of the excitation temperatures and we demonstrate that LTE conditions are typically not fulfilled for the propyne molecule.
#### Extrapolating the projected potential of gravitational lens models:  property-preserving degeneracies

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17591
 - **Abstract**
 While gravitational lens inversion holds great promise to reveal the structure of the light-deflecting mass distribution, both light and dark, the existence of various kinds of degeneracies implies that care must be taken when interpreting the resulting lens models. This article illustrates how thinking in terms of the projected potential helps to gain insight into these matters. Additionally it is shown explicitly how, when starting from a discretised version of the projected potential of one particular lens model, the technique of quadratic programming can be used to create a multitude of equivalent lens models that preserve all or a subset of lens properties. This method is applied to a number of scenarios, showing the lack of grasp on the mass outside the strong lensing region, revisiting mass redistribution in between images and applying this to a recent model of the SDSS J1004+4112 cluster, as well as illustrating the generalised mass sheet degeneracy and source-position transformation. In the case of J1004 we show that this mass redistribution did not succeed at completely eliminating a dark mass clump recovered by GRALE near one of the quasar images.
#### Testing approximate infrared scattering radiative-transfer methods for  hot Jupiter atmospheres

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17697
 - **Abstract**
 The calculation of internal atmospheric (longwave) fluxes is a key component of any model of exoplanet atmospheres that requires radiative-transfer (RT) calculations. For atmospheres containing a strong scattering component such as cloud particles, most 1D multiple-scattering RT methods typically involve numerically expensive matrix inversions. This computational bottleneck is exacerbated when multitudes of RT calculations are required, such as in general circulation models (GCMs) and retrieval methods. In an effort to increase the speed of RT calculations without sacrificing too much accuracy, we investigate the applicability of approximate longwave scattering methods developed for the Earth science community to hot Jupiter atmospheres. We test the absorption approximation (AA) and variational iteration method (VIM) applied to typical cloudy hot Jupiter scenarios, using 64 stream DISORT calculations as reference solutions. We find the four-stream VIM variant is a highly promising method to explore using for hot Jupiter GCM and retrieval modelling, showing excellent speed characteristics, with typical errors $\sim$1\% for outgoing fluxes and within $\sim$50\%, but with larger errors in the deep cloud layer test case, for vertical heating rates. Other methods explored in this study were found to typically produce similar error characteristics in vertical heating rates.
