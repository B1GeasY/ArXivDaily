 - **Abstract**
 Each supernova's energy drives interstellar medium (ISM) turbulence and can help launch galactic winds. What difference does it make if $10\%$ of the energy is initially deposited into cosmic rays? To answer this question and study cosmic-ray feedback, we perform galactic patch simulations of a stratified ISM. We compare two magnetohydrodynamic and cosmic ray (MHD+CR) simulations, which are identical except for how each supernova's energy is injected. In one, $10\%$ of the energy is injected as cosmic-ray energy and the rest is thermal. In the other case, energy injection is strictly thermal. We find that cosmic-ray injections (1) drive a faster vertical motion with more mass, (2) produce a more vertically oriented magnetic field, and (3) increase the scale height of warm gas outside the midplane $(z \gtrsim 0.5\,\mathrm{kpc})$. Both simulations show the formation of cold clouds (with a total mass fraction $>50\%$) through the Parker instability and thermal instability. We also show that the Parker instability leads to a decorrelation of cosmic-ray pressure and gas density. Finally, our simulations show that a vertical magnetic field can lead to a significant decrease in the calorimetric fraction for injected cosmic rays.

 - **Abstract**
 Using archival Hubble Space Telescope observations, we report the discovery of four variable low-mass white dwarfs ($0.18 \, M_\odot \leq M \leq 0.5 \,M_\odot$) in the globular cluster NGC 6397. One source exhibits a periodic optical modulation of $5.21 \pm 0.02$ hours, which we interpret as potentially due to the rotation of a magnetic helium core WD (He WD). This makes this candidate the second magnetic He WD in NGC 6397, and one of the few He WDs with a measured rotation period. The other three candidates show aperiodic variability, with a change in magnitude ranging from $\sim 0.11-0.6$. These discoveries highlight the importance of high-cadence photometric surveys in dense stellar environments. Follow-up spectroscopic observations are needed to confirm the nature of the variability of these systems.
#### A statistical approach for interpreting polarized dust emission of the filamentary molecular clouds toward the estimate of 3D magnetic field structure

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we perform 3D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of filamentary molecular clouds. We then generate synthetic observations based on the simulation results. Using these, we investigate how the new polarization data analysis method recently introduced by \citet{2021ApJ...923L...9D} reflects the magnetic field structure in turbulent filamentary molecular clouds. \citet{2021ApJ...923L...9D} proposed that the $R_{\rm{FWHM}}$, the ratio of the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the polarized intensity ($PI$) to that of the total intensity ($I$) can be used to probe the three-dimensional structure of the magnetic field. We calculate the $R_{\rm{FWHM}}$ from the density and magnetic field structure obtained in the 3D-MHD simulations. We find that the mean and variance of $R_{\rm{FWHM}}$ within a filament are smaller and larger, respectively, with a larger inclination of the magnetic field to the plane-of-sky. We also find that both small-scale ($<0.1~\rm{pc}$) and large-scale ($\gtrsim 0.1~\rm{pc}$) turbulence affect the polarized intensity of the dust thermal emission. We conclude that future extensive observations of $R_{\rm{FWHM}}$ may be able to quantify the inclination of the magnetic field to the plane-of-sky in the filamentary molecular clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar molecules are excellent tools for studying the physical and chemical environments of massive star-forming regions. In particular, vibrationally excited HC$_3$N (HC$_3$N*) lines are the key tracers for probing hot cores environments. We present the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 3 mm observations of HC$_3$N* lines in 60 hot cores, aiming to investigate how physical conditions affect the excitation of HC$_3$N* transitions. We have used the XCLASS for line identification. Under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), we derived the rotation temperature and column density of HC$_3$N* transitions in hot cores. Additionally, we calculated the H$_2$ column density and number density, along with the abundance of HC$_3$N* relative to H$_2$, to enable a comparison of the physical properties of hot cores with different numbers of HC$_3$N* states. We have detected HC$_3$N* lines in 52 hot cores, in which 29 cores showing more than one vibrationally excited state. Hot cores with higher gas temperatures have more detections of these vibrationally excited lines. The excitation of HC$_3$N* requires dense environments, with its spatial distribution influenced by the presence of UC Hii regions. The observed column density of HC$_3$N* contributes to the number of HC$_3$N* states in hot core environments. After analyzing the various factors influencing HC$_3$N* excitation in hot cores, we conclude that the excitation of HC$_3$N* is mainly driven by mid-IR pumping, while collisional excitation is ineffective.

 - **Abstract**
 Strongly lensed quasars provide valuable insights into the rate of cosmic expansion, the distribution of dark matter in foreground deflectors, and the characteristics of quasar hosts. However, detecting them in astronomical images is difficult due to the prevalence of non-lensing objects. To address this challenge, we developed a generative deep learning model called VariLens, built upon a physics-informed variational autoencoder. This model seamlessly integrates three essential modules: image reconstruction, object classification, and lens modeling, offering a fast and comprehensive approach to strong lens analysis. VariLens is capable of rapidly determining both (1) the probability that an object is a lens system and (2) key parameters of a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) mass model -- including the Einstein radius ($\theta_\mathrm{E}$), lens center, and ellipticity -- in just milliseconds using a single CPU. A direct comparison of VariLens estimates with traditional lens modeling for 20 known lensed quasars within the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) footprint shows good agreement, with both results consistent within $2\sigma$ for systems with $\theta_\mathrm{E}<3$ arcsecs. To identify new lensed quasar candidates, we begin with an initial sample of approximately 80 million sources, combining HSC data with multiwavelength information from various surveys. After applying a photometric preselection aimed at locating $z>1.5$ sources, the number of candidates is reduced to 710,966. Subsequently, VariLens highlights 13,831 sources, each showing a high likelihood of being a lens. A visual assessment of these objects results in 42 promising candidates that await spectroscopic confirmation. These results underscore the potential of automated deep learning pipelines to efficiently detect and model strong lenses in large datasets.
#### The interdependence between density PDF, CMF and IMF and their relation with Mach number in simulations

 - **Abstract**
 The initial mass function (IMF) of stars and the corresponding cloud mass function (CMF), traditionally considered universal, exhibit variations that are influenced by the local environment. Notably, these variations are apparent in the distribution's tail, indicating a possible relationship between local dynamics and mass distribution. Our study is designed to examine how the gas PDF , the IMF and the CMF depend on the local turbulence within the interstellar medium (ISM). We run hydrodynamical simulations on small star-forming sections of the ISM under varying turbulence conditions, characterized by Mach numbers of 1, 3.5, and 10, and with two distinct mean densities. This approach allowed us to observe the effects of different turbulence levels on the formation of stellar and cloud masses. The study demonstrates a clear correlation between the dynamics of the cloud and the IMF. In environments with lower levels of turbulence likely dominated by gravitational collapse, our simulations showed the formation of more massive structures with a powerlaw gas PDF, leading to a top-heavy IMF and CMF. On the other hand environment dominated by turbulence result in a lognormal PDF and a Salpeter-like CMF and IMF. This indicates that the turbulence level is a critical factor in determining the mass distribution within star-forming regions.
#### The Galactic Disk North-south Asymmetry in Metallicity May Be A New Tracer for the Disk Warp

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic disk warp has been widely characterized by stellar distributions and stellar kinematics but has not been traced by stellar chemistry. Here, we use a sample with over 170,000 red clump (RC) stars selected from LAMOST and APOGEE first to establish a correlation between the north-south asymmetry in metallicity ([Fe/H]) and the disk warp. Our results indicate that the height of the [Fe/H] mid-plane for the whole RC sample stars is accurately described as $Z_{w}$ = 0.017 ($R$ $-$ 7.112)$^{2}$ sin($\phi$ $-$ 9.218). This morphology aligns closely with the warp traced by Cepheids, suggesting that the disk north-south asymmetry in [Fe/H] may serve as a new tracer for the Galactic warp. Our detailed analysis of the young/thin disk stars of this RC sample suggests that its warp is well-modeled as $Z_{w}$ = 0.016 ($R$ $-$ 6.507)$^{2}$ sin($\phi$ $-$ 4.240), indicating that the line of node (LON) of the Galactic warp is oriented at 4.240$_{-1.747}^{+1.641}$ degree.

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic Center provides a unique opportunity to observe a galactic core, objects in close proximity to a supermassive black hole (SMBH), and star formation channels that exhibit imprints of this peculiar environment. This habitat hosts, in addition to the SMBH Sgr A*, a surprisingly young cluster with the so-called S-stars. These stars orbit the SMBH on timescales of a few years with thousands of km/s. While the presence of high-velocity stars in the S-cluster already raises a variety of scientific questions, the observation of several bright L-band emission sources has resulted in a rich discussion of their nature. The detection of a prominent Doppler-shifted Br$\gamma$ line accompanies most of these sources that seem to be embedded in a dusty envelope. Using the radiative-transfer model HYPERION, we find strong indications of the presence of a stellar low-mass population embedded in the S-cluster. We revisit this intriguing cluster and its dusty members that orbit the supermassive black hole Sgr A* on bound Keplerian trajectories. Among these cluster members, there is one source that initiated the studies of this analysis: G1. We find that the flux density of G1 in the NIR and MIR resembles a spectral energy distribution of a Class I YSO, which contributes to the "Paradox of Youth".

 - **Abstract**
 Among solar system objects, comets coming from the Oort Cloud are an elusive population, intrinsically rare and difficult to detect. Nonetheless, as the more pristine objects we can observe, they encapsulate critical cues on the formation of planetary systems and are the focus of many scientific investigations and science missions. The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), which will start to operate from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in 2025, is expected to dramatically improve our detection ability of these comets by performing regular monitoring of the Southern sky deep down to magnitude 24.5 with excellent astrometry. However, making straightforward predictions on future LSST detection rates is challenging due to our biased knowledge of the underlying population. This is because identifications to date have been conducted by various surveys or individual observers, often without detailed information on their respective selection functions. Recent efforts to predict incoming flux of Long Period Comets still suffer of the lack of systematic, well-characterized, homogeneous cometary surveys. Here, we adopt a different point of view by asking how much earlier~on known comets on long-period or hyperbolic orbits would have been discovered by a LSST-like survey if it was already in place 10 years prior to their perihelion epoch. In this case, we are not simulating a real flux of incoming comet, as all comets in our sample reach the perihelion simultaneously, but we can analyze the impact of a LSST-like survey on individual objects. We find that LSST would have found about 40% of comets in our sample at least 5 years prior to their perihelion epoch, and at double (at least) the distance at which they were actually discovered. Based on this approach, we find that LSST has the potentiality to at least twofold the current discovery rate of long-period and hyperbolic comets.

 - **Abstract**
 When the ejecta of supernovae interact with the progenitor star's circumstellar environment, a strong shock is driven back into the ejecta, causing the material to become bright optically and in X-rays. Most notably, as the shock traverses the H-rich envelope, it begins to interact with metal rich material. Thus, continued monitoring of bright and nearby supernovae provides valuable clues about both the progenitor structure and its pre-supernova evolution. Here we present late-time, multi-epoch optical and Chandra} X-ray spectra of the core-collapse supernova SN 1996cr. Magellan IMACS optical spectra taken in July 2017 and August 2021 show a very different spectrum from that seen in 2006 with broad, double-peaked optical emission lines of oxygen, argon, and sulfur with expansion velocities of $\pm 4500$ km s$^{-1}$. Red-shifted emission components are considerably fainter compared to the blue-shifted components, presumably due to internal extinction from dust in the supernova ejecta. Broad $\pm 2400$ km s$^{-1}$ H$\alpha$ is also seen which we infer is shocked progenitor pre-SN mass-loss, H-rich material. Chandra data indicate a slow but steady decline in overall X-ray luminosity, suggesting that the forward shock has broken through any circumstellar shell or torus which is inferred from prior deep Chandra ACIS-S/HETG observations. The X-ray properties are consistent with what is expected from a shock breaking out into a lower density environment. Though originally identified as a SN IIn, based upon late time optical emission line spectra, we argue that the SN 1996cr progenitor was partially or highly stripped, suggesting a SN IIb/Ib.
#### COZMIC. III. Cosmological Zoom-in Simulations of SIDM with Suppressed Initial Conditions

 - **Abstract**
 We present eight cosmological dark matter (DM)--only zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way-like system that include suppression of the linear matter power spectrum $P(k)$, and/or velocity-dependent DM self-interactions, as the third installment of the COZMIC suite. We consider a model featuring a massive dark photon that mediates DM self-interactions and decays into massless dark fermions. The dark photon and dark fermions suppress linear matter perturbations, resulting in dark acoustic oscillations in $P(k)$, which ultimately affect dwarf galaxy scales. The model also features a velocity-dependent elastic self-interaction between DM particles (SIDM), with a cross section that can alleviate small-scale structure anomalies. For the first time, our simulations test the impact of $P(k)$ suppression on gravothermal evolution in an SIDM scenario that leads to core collapse in (sub)halos with present-day virial masses below $\approx 10^9~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$. In simulations with $P(k)$ suppression and self-interactions, the lack of low-mass (sub)halos and the delayed growth of structure reduce the fraction of core-collapsed systems relative to SIDM simulations without $P(k)$ suppression. In particular, $P(k)$ suppression that saturates current warm DM constraints almost entirely erases core collapse in isolated halos. Models with less extreme $P(k)$ suppression produce core collapse in $\approx 20\%$ of subhalos and $\approx 5\%$ of isolated halos above $10^8~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$, and also increase the abundance of extremely low-concentration isolated low-mass halos relative to SIDM. These results reveal a complex interplay between early and late-universe DM physics, revealing new discovery scenarios in the context of upcoming small-scale structure measurements.
#### Origin of $\alpha$-Poor Very Metal-Poor Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Among very metal-poor (VMP) stars, $\alpha$-poor VMP ($\alpha$PVMP) stars that have sub-solar values of ${\rm [X/Fe]}$ for Mg and other $\alpha$ elements are rare and are thought to have been formed from gas polluted by Type 1a supernova (SN 1a). However, recent analyses indicate that pure core-collapse supernova (CCSN) ejecta can also be a likely source. We perform a detailed analysis of 17 $\alpha$PVMP stars by considering six different scenarios relevant to the early Galaxy. We consider a single pair-instability supernova (PISN) and a single CCSN. Additionally, we consider the combination of ejecta from a CCSN with ejecta from another CCSN, a PISN, a near-Chandrasekhar mass (near-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) SN 1a, and a sub-Chandrasekhar mass (sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) SN 1a. A clear signature can only be established for sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a with a near-smoking-gun signature in SDSSJ0018-0939 and a reasonably clear signature in ET0381. The majority ($82\%$) of $\alpha$PVMP stars can be explained by pure CCSN ejecta and do not require any SN 1a contribution. However, the combination of CCSN and sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a ejecta can also explain most ($76\%$) of $\alpha$PVMP stars. In contrast, the combination of ejecta from CCSN with near-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a and PISN can fit $41\%$ and $29\%$ of the stars, respectively. The single PISN scenario is strongly ruled out for all stars. Our results indicate that $\alpha$PVMP stars are equally compatible with pure CCSN ejecta and a combination of CCSN and SN 1a ejecta, with sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a being roughly twice as frequent as near-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of Persistent Radio Sources (PRSs) associated with three repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) has provided insight into the local environments of these FRBs. Here, we present deep radio observations of the fields surrounding three highly active repeating FRBs namely, FRB 20220912A, FRB 20240114A, and FRB 20240619D using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at low radio frequencies. Towards FRB~20240114A, we report the detection of compact source at 650\,MHz with a flux density of 65.6$\pm$8.1\,$\mu$Jy/beam. Our measurements of the spectral index, star formation rate of the host galaxy and recently reported constraints on the physical size strongly argue for our detected source to be a persistent radio source (PRS) associated with the FRB 20240114A. For FRB~20220912A, we detect radio emission that is most likely due to star formation in the host galaxy. For FRB 20240619D, we provide upper limits on the radio emission from an associated PRS or the host galaxy. The detection of the PRS associated with FRB~20240114A is a useful addition to the PRSs known to be associated with only three other FRBs so far, and further supports the origin of the PRS in the form of magnetoionic medium surrounding the FRB sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Linkage between core-collapse supernovae (SNe) and their progenitors is not fully understood and ongoing effort of searching and identifying the progenitors is needed. $\mathrm{SN\,2024abfl}$ is a recent Type II supernova exploded in the nearby star-bursting galaxy $\mathrm{NGC\,2146}$, which is also the host galaxy of $\mathrm{SN\,2018zd}$. From archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data, we have found a red source ($\mathrm{m_{F814W} \sim 25}$) near the location (angular distance $\leq 0.2"$) of $\mathrm{SN\,2024abfl}$ before its explosion. With F814W and F606W photometry, we found that the properties of this source matched a typical red supergiant (RSG) moderately reddened by interstellar dust at the distance of the host galaxy. We conclude that the $\mathrm{SN\,2024abfl}$ had an RSG progenitor with initial mass of $\mathrm{10M_{\odot}}$--$\mathrm{16\,M_{\odot}}$.
