 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar dust at high Galactic latitudes can influence astronomical foreground subtraction, produce diffuse scattered light, and result in harder (de-reddened) ultraviolet spectra of quasars. In a sample of 94 quasars at high latitude and low extinction, we evaluate the interstellar "gas-to-dust ratio", $N_{\rm H}/E(B-V)$, using hydrogen column densities (H I and H$_2$) and far-infrared estimates of dust reddening. In the Galactic plane, this ratio is $6.0\pm0.2$ (in units of $10^{21}~{\rm cm}^{-2}~{\rm mag}^{-1}$). In a sub-sample of 51 quasars with measurements of both H I and H$_2$ and $0.01 \leq E(B-V) \lesssim 0.1$, we find mean ratios $10.3\pm0.4$ (gas at all velocities) and $9.2\pm0.3$ (low velocity only). Including H$_2$ increases $N_{\rm H}$ by $\sim10$%, even at high latitude. On average, recent Planck estimates of $E(B-V)$ in low reddening sight lines are 12% higher than those from Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011), and $N_{\rm HI}$ exhibits significant variations when measured at different radio telescopes. We also show that $E(B-V)$ is sensitive to far-infrared modeled dust temperature $T_d$ and emissivity index $\beta$. Consequently, gas-to-dust ratios have large, asymmetric errors at low $E(B-V)$. The ratios are elevated in sight lines with high-velocity clouds, which contribute $N_{\rm H}$ but little reddening. In Complex C, the ratio decreases by 40% when high velocity gas is excluded. Decreases in dust content are expected in low-metallicity gas above the Galactic plane, resulting from grain destruction in shocks, settling to the disk, and thermal sputtering in hot halo gas.

 - **Abstract**
 The complex chemistry that occurs in star-forming regions can provide insight into the formation of prebiotic molecules at various evolutionary stages of star formation. To study this process, we present millimeter-wave interferometric observations of the neighboring hot cores W3(H$_2$O) and W3(OH) carried out using the NOEMA interferometer. We have analyzed distributions of six molecules that account for most observed lines across both cores and have constructed physical parameter maps for rotational temperature, column density, and velocity field with corresponding uncertainties. We discuss the derived spatial distributions of these parameters in the context of the physical structure of the source. We propose the use of HCOOCH$_3$ as a new temperature tracer in W3(H$_2$O) and W3(OH) in addition to the more commonly used CH$_3$CN. By analyzing the physically-derived parameters for each molecule across both W3(H$_2$O) and W3(OH), the work presented herein further demonstrates the impact of physical environment on hot cores at different evolutionary stages.

 - **Abstract**
 Protostellar disks are a ubiquitous part of the star formation process and the future sites of planet formation. As part of the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) large program, we present high-angular resolution dust continuum ($\sim40\,$mas) and molecular line ($\sim150\,$mas) observations of the Class 0 protostar, IRAS 15398-3359. The dust continuum is small, compact, and centrally peaked, while more extended dust structures are found in the outflow directions. We perform a 2D Gaussian fitting to find the deconvolved size and $2\sigma$ radius of the dust disk to be $4.5\times2.8\,\mathrm{au}$ and $3.8\,\mathrm{au}$, respectively. We estimate the gas+dust disk mass assuming optically thin continuum emission to be $0.6-1.8\,M_\mathrm{jup}$, indicating a very low-mass disk. The CO isotopologues trace components of the outflows and inner envelope, while SO traces a compact, rotating disk-like component. Using several rotation curve fittings on the PV diagram of the SO emission, the lower limits of the protostellar mass and gas disk radius are $0.022\,M_\odot$ and $31.2\,\mathrm{au}$ from our Modified 2 single power-law fitting. A conservative upper limit of the protostellar mass is inferred to be $0.1\,M_\odot$. The protostellar mass-accretion rate and the specific angular momentum at the protostellar disk edge are found to be between $1.3-6.1\times10^{-6}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ and $1.2-3.8\times10^{-4}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,pc}$, respectively, with an age estimated between $0.4-7.5\times10^{4}\,$yr. At this young age with no clear substructures in the disk, planet formation would likely not yet have started. This study highlights the importance of high-resolution observations and systematic fitting procedures when deriving dynamical properties of deeply embedded Class 0 protostars.

 - **Abstract**
 The observation of interstellar objects 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov suggests the existence of a larger population of smaller projectiles that impact our planet with unbound orbits. We analyze an asteroidal grazing meteor (FH1) recorded by the Finnish Fireball Network on October 23, 2022. FH1 displayed a likely hyperbolic orbit lying on the ecliptic plane with an estimated velocity excess of $\sim$0.7 km$\,$s$^{-1}$ at impact. FH1 may either be an interstellar object, indicating a high-strength bias in this population, or an Oort cloud object, which would reinforce migration-based solar system models. Furthermore, under the calculated uncertainties, FH1 could potentially be associated with the passage of Scholz's binary star system. Statistical evaluation of uncertainties in the CNEOS database and study of its hyperbolic fireballs reveals an anisotropic geocentric radiant distribution and low orbital inclinations, challenging the assumption of a randomly incoming interstellar population. Orbital integrations suggest that the event on March 9, 2017 (IM2) from CNEOS may have experienced gravitational perturbation during the Scholz fly-by, contingent upon velocity overestimation within the expected range. These findings suggest that apparent interstellar meteors may, in fact, be the result of accelerated meteoroid impacts caused by close encounters with massive objects within or passing through our solar system.

 - **Abstract**
 The TeV afterglow detected by LHAASO has been interpreted as arising from a narrow jet while the radio to X-ray afterglows are explained as arising from a wide structured jet. However, there is no model explaining the TeV and lower-energy multi-wavelength afterglows simultaneously. We here investigate a two-component jet model, including an inner narrow core and an outer wide wing with an angular structure, to explain both the early TeV afterglow and multi-wavelength afterglows that last up to 100 days. We find that the radio afterglow and the TeV upper limit imposed by H.E.S.S. observations combine to constrain the circum-burst density to be low at larger radii. Thus, a decreasing density profile with radius is favored. Considering that the rising TeV light curve during the afterglow onset favors a constant-density medium, we invoke a stratified density profile, including a constant-density profile at small radii and a wind density profile at large radii. We find that the two-component jet model with such a stratified density profile can explain the TeV, X-ray and optical afterglows of GRB 221009A, although the radio fluxes exceed the observed ones by a factor of two at later epochs. The discrepancy in the radio afterglow could be resolved by invoking some non-standard assumption about the microphysics of afterglow shocks, such as a decreasing fraction of accelerated particles with time. The total kinetic energy of the two components in our model is $\lesssim 10^{52}{\rm erg}$, significantly smaller than that in the single structured jet models.
