 - **Abstract**
 JWST/MIRI has sharpened our infrared eyes toward the star formation process. This paper presents the first mid-infrared detection of gaseous SO$_2$ emission in an embedded low-mass protostellar system. MIRI-MRS observations of the low-mass protostellar binary NGC 1333 IRAS2A are presented from the JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS+) program, revealing emission from the SO$_2~\nu_3$ asymmetric stretching mode at 7.35 micron. The results are compared to those derived from high-angular resolution SO$_2$ data obtained with ALMA. The SO$_2$ emission from the $\nu_3$ band is predominantly located on $\sim50-100$ au scales around the main component of the binary, IRAS2A1. A rotational temperature of $92\pm8$ K is derived from the $\nu_3$ lines. This is in good agreement with the rotational temperature derived from pure rotational lines in the vibrational ground state (i.e., $\nu=0$) with ALMA ($104\pm5$ K). However, the emission of the $\nu_3$ lines is not in LTE given that the total number of molecules predicted by a LTE model is found to be a factor $2\times10^4$ higher than what is derived for the $\nu=0$ state. This difference can be explained by a vibrational temperature that is $\sim100$ K higher than the derived rotational temperature of the $\nu=0$ state. The brightness temperature derived from the continuum around the $\nu_3$ band of SO$_2$ is $\sim180$ K, which confirms that the $\nu_3=1$ level is not collisionally populated but rather infrared pumped by scattered radiation. This is also consistent with the non-detection of the $\nu_2$ bending mode at 18-20 micron. Given the rotational temperature, the extent of the emission ($\sim100$ au in radius), and the narrow line widths in the ALMA data (3.5 km/s), the SO$_2$ in IRAS2A likely originates from ice sublimation in the central hot core around the protostar rather than from an accretion shock at the disk-envelope boundary.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an atlas and follow-up spectroscopic observations of 87 thin stream-like structures detected with the STREAMFINDER algorithm in Gaia DR3, of which 29 are new discoveries. Here we focus on using these streams to refine mass models of the Galaxy. Fits with a double power law halo with the outer power law slope set to $-\beta_h=3$ yield an inner power law slope $-\gamma_h=0.97^{+0.17}_{-0.21}$, a scale radius of $r_{0, h}=14.7^{+4.7}_{-1.0}$ kpc, a halo density flattening $q_{m, h}=0.75\pm0.03$, and a local dark matter density of $\rho_{h, \odot}=0.0114\pm0.0007 {\rm M_\odot pc^{-3}}$. Freeing $\beta$ yields $\beta=2.53^{+0.42}_{-0.16}$, but this value is heavily influenced by our chosen virial mass limit. The stellar disks are found to have a combined mass of $4.20^{+0.44}_{-0.53}\times10^{10} {\rm M_\odot}$, with the thick disk contributing $12.4\pm0.7$\% to the local stellar surface density. The scale length of the thin and thick disks are $2.17^{+0.18}_{-0.08}$ kpc and $1.62^{+0.72}_{-0.13}$ kpc, respectively, while their scale heights are $0.347^{+0.007}_{-0.010}$ kpc and $0.86^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$ kpc, respectively. The virial mass of the favored model is $M_{200}=1.09^{+0.19}_{-0.14}\times 10^{12} {\rm M_\odot}$, while the mass inside of 50 kpc is $M_{R<50}=0.46\pm0.03\times 10^{12} {\rm M_\odot}$. We introduce the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) into the derived potential models, and fit the "Orphan" stream therein, finding a mass for the LMC that is consistent with recent estimates. Some highlights of the atlas include the nearby trailing arm of $\omega$-Cen, and a nearby very metal-poor stream that was once a satellite of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. Finally, we unambiguously detect a hot component around the GD-1 stream, consistent with it having been tidally pre-processed within its own DM subhalo.

 - **Abstract**
 The canonical picture of star formation involves disk-mediated accretion, with Keplerian accretion disks and associated bipolar jets primarily observed in nearby, low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs). Recently, rotating gaseous structures and Keplerian disks have been detected around a number of massive (M > 8 solar masses) YSOs (MYSOs) including several disk-jet systems. All of the known MYSO systems are located in the Milky Way, and all are embedded in their natal material. Here we report the detection of a rotating gaseous structure around an extragalactic MYSO in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The gas motions show radial flow of material falling from larger scales onto a central disk-like structure, the latter exhibiting signs of Keplerian rotation, i.e., a rotating toroid feeding an accretion disk and thus the growth of the central star. The system is in almost all aspects comparable to Milky Way high-mass young stellar objects accreting gas via a Keplerian disk. The key difference between this source and its Galactic counterparts is that it is optically revealed, rather than being deeply embedded in its natal material as is expected of such a young massive star. We suggest that this is the consequence of the star having formed in a low-metallicity and low-dust content environment, thus providing important constraints for models of the formation and evolution of massive stars and their circumstellar disks.
#### Line Driven Instabilities due to Continuum Radiation Transport in  Stellar Winds

 - **Abstract**
 We study line driven stellar winds using time-dependent radiation hydrodynamics where the continuum radiation couples to the gas via either a scattering or absorption opacity and there is an additional radiation force due to spectral lines that we model in the Sobolev approximation. We find that in winds with scattering opacities, instabilties tend to be suppressed and the wind reaches a steady state. Winds with absorption opacities are unstable and remain clumpy at late times. Clumps persist because they are continually regenerated in the subcritical part of the flow. Azimuthal gradients in the radial velocity distribution cause a drop in the radial radiation force and provide a mechanism for generating clumps. These clumps form on super-Sobolev scales, but at late times become Sobolev-length sized indicating that our radiation transfer model is breaking down. Inferring the clump distribution at late times therefore requires radiation-hydrodynamic modeling below the Sobolev scale.

 - **Abstract**
 We present 1-5um spectroscopy of the coldest known brown dwarf, WISE J085510.83-071442.5 (WISE 0855), performed with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). NIRSpec has dramatically improved the measurement of spectral energy distribution of WISE 0855 in terms of wavelength coverage, signal-to-noise ratios, and spectral resolution. We have performed preliminary modeling of the NIRSpec data using the ATMO 2020 models of cloudless atmospheres, arriving at a best fitting model that has T_eff=285 K. That temperature is ~20 K higher than the value derived by combining our luminosity estimate with evolutionary models (i.e., the radius in the model fit to the SED is somewhat smaller than expected from evolutionary models). Through comparisons to the model spectra, we detect absorption in the fundamental band of CO, which is consistent with an earlier detection in a ground-based spectrum and indicates the presence of vertical mixing. Although PH_3 is expected in Y dwarfs that experience vertical mixing, it is not detected in WISE 0855. Previous ground-based M-band spectroscopy of WISE 0855 has been cited for evidence of H_2O ice clouds, but we find that the NIRSpec data in that wavelength range are matched well by our cloudless model. Thus, clear evidence of H_2O ice clouds in WISE 0855 has not been identified yet, but it may still be present in the NIRSpec data. The physical properties of WISE 0855, including the presence of H_2O clouds, can be better constrained by more detailed fitting with both cloudless and cloudy models and the incorporation of unpublished 5-28um data from the Mid-infrared Instrument on JWST.
#### ALMA High-resolution Spectral Survey of Thioformaldehyde (H2CS) Towards  Massive Protoclusters

 - **Abstract**
 Investigating the temperature and density structures of gas in massive protoclusters is crucial for understanding the chemical properties therein. In this study, we present observations of the continuum and thioformaldehyde (H2CS) lines at 345 GHz of 11 massive protoclusters using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) telescope. High spatial resolution and sensitivity observations have detected 145 continuum cores from the 11 sources. H2CS line transitions are observed in 72 out of 145 cores, including line-rich cores, warm cores and cold cores. The H2 column densities of the 72 cores are estimated from the continuum emission which are larger than the density threshold value for star formation, suggesting that H2CS can be widely distributed in star-forming cores with different physical environments. Rotation temperature and column density of H2CS are derived by use of the XCLASS software. The results show the H2CS abundances increase as temperature rises and higher gas temperatures are usually associated with higher H2CS column densities. The abundances of H2CS are positively correlated with its column density, suggesting that the H2CS abundances are enhanced from cold cores, warm cores to line-rich cores in star forming regions.
#### Generation of Isocurvature from Curvature Inhomogeneities on  Super-Horizon Scales

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.17379
 - **Abstract**
 Here it is shown 1) how isocurvature inhomogeneities correlated on causally disconnected (super-horizon) scales are generated from curvature inhomogeneities which are known to be correlated on these scales 2) that super-horizon isocurvature generation is nearly inevitable for non-equilibrium chemical processes 3) that the amplitude of the compositional isocurvature correlations a) can be large for production of rare objects, b) falls off rapidly with separation c) falls off at scales below the horizon when these modes are generated. These two fall-offs results in an "isocurvature bump" in the power spectrum. Isocurvature generation is illustrated by the process of dark matter freeze-in, computed here with both separate universe modelling and linear perturbation theory. For freeze-in the most prominent isocurvature modes are inhomogeneities in the ratio of dark matter to standard model matter. Much smaller inhomogeneities in the ratio of baryons to standard model entropy are also produced. Previous constraints on freeze-in from Ly-$\alpha$ clouds limit the bump enhancement to $\lesssim10\%$ on comoving scales $\lesssim1\,$Mpc. Current observations are not sensitive to the isocurvature modes generated in viable freeze-in models. Results are obtained using a somewhat novel framework to describe cosmological inhomogeneities.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-epoch VLBI observations measure 3D water maser motions in protostellar outflows, enabling analysis of inclination and velocity. However, these analyses assume that water masers and shock surfaces within outflows are co-propagating. We compared VLBI data on maser-traced bowshocks in high-mass protostar AFGL 5142-MM1, from seven epochs of archival data from the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA), obtained from April 2014 to May 2015, and our newly-conducted data from the KVN and VERA Array (KaVA), obtained in March 2016. We find an inconsistency between the expected displacement of the bowshocks and the motions of individual masers. The separation between two opposing bowshocks in AFGL 5142-MM1 was determined to be $337.17\pm0.07~\rm{mas}$ in the KaVA data, which is less than an expected value of $342.1\pm0.7~\rm{mas}$ based on extrapolation of the proper motions of individual maser features measured by VERA. Our measurements imply that the bowshock propagates at a velocity of $24\pm3~\rm{km~s^{-1}}$, while the individual masing gas clumps move at an average velocity of $55\pm5~\rm{km~s^{-1}}$, i.e. the water masers are moving in the outflow direction at double the speed at which the bowshocks are propagating. Our results emphasise that investigations of individual maser features are best approached using short-term high-cadence VLBI monitoring, while long-term monitoring on timescales comparable to the lifetimes of maser features, are better suited to tracing the overall evolution of shock surfaces. Observers should be aware that masers and shock surfaces can move relative to each other, and that this can affect the interpretation of protostellar outflows.
#### Supernovae in 2023 (review): breakthroughs by late observations

 - **Abstract**
 I present a review of how late observations of supernovae, of the nebular phase, and much later of supernova remnants (SNRs), and their analysis in 2023 made progress towards breakthroughs in supporting the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) for core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and in introducing the group of lonely white dwarf (WD) scenarios for type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The new analyses of CCSN remnants (CCSNRs) reveal point-symmetric morphologies in a way unnoticed before in three CCSNRs. Comparison to multipolar planetary nebulae that are shaped by jets suggests that jets exploded these CCSNe, as predicted by the JJEM, but incompatible with the prediction of the delayed neutrino explosion mechanism. The spherical morphology of the ejecta Pa 30 of the historical type Iax supernova (SN Iax) of 1181 AD, which studies in 2023 revealed, is mostly compatible with the explosion of a lonely WD. Namely, at the explosion time, there is only a WD, without any close companion, although the WD was formed via a close binary interaction, i.e., binary merger. An identification of point-symmetry in SNR G1.9+0.3, a normal SN Ia and the youngest SN in the Galaxy, suggests an SN explosion of a lonely WD inside a planetary nebula (an SNIP). The group of lonely WD scenarios includes the core degenerate scenario and the double degenerate scenario with a merger to explosion delay (MED) time. SN Ia explosions of lonely WDs are common, and might actually account for most (or even all) normal SNe Ia.
