 - **Abstract**
 Noble gases provide tracers of cosmic provenance that are accessible to a future Uranus Atmospheric Probe. Argon and krypton are expected to be well-mixed on Uranus with respect to H$_2$ and He, although condensation at the winter pole may be possible. The Ar/H$_2$ and Ar/Kr ratios address whether the materials accreted by Uranus resembled the extremely cold materials accreted by Jupiter's atmosphere, or whether they were warmer like comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, or whether Uranus is like neither. Xenon condenses as an ice, probably on methane ice, in Uranus's upper troposphere. Condensation may complicate interpretation of Xe/H$_2$, but it also presents an opportunity to collect concentrated xenon samples suitable for measuring isotopes. Solar System Xe tracks three distinct nucleosynthetic xenon reservoirs, one evident in the Sun and in chondritic meteorites, a second in refractory presolar grains, and a third evident in comet 67P/C-G and in Earth's air. The first and third reservoirs appear to have been captured from different clouds of gas. The two gases do not appear to have been well-mixed; moreover, the high $^{129}$Xe/$^{132}$Xe ratio in 67P/C-G implies that the gas was captured before the initial nucleosynthetic complement of $^{129}$I (15.7 Myr half-life) had decayed. Xenon's isotopic peculiarities, if seen in Uranus, could usefully upset our understanding of planetary origins. Krypton's isotopic anomalies are more subtle and may prove hard to measure. There is a slight chance that neon and helium fractionations can be used to constrain how Uranus acquired its nebular envelope.

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamical masses of young planets aged between 10 and 200 Myr detected in imaging play a crucial role in shaping models of giant planet formation. Regrettably, only a few such objects possess these characteristics. Furthermore, the evolutionary pattern of young sub-stellar companions in near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams might diverge from free-floating objects, possibly due to differing formation processes. The recent identification of a giant planet around AF Lep, part of the beta Pic moving group (BPMG), encouraged us to re-examine these points. We considered updated dynamical masses and luminosities for the sub-stellar objects in the BPMG. In addition, we compared the properties of sub-stellar companions and free-floating objects in the BPMG and other young associations remapping the positions of the objects in the colour-magnitude diagram into a dustiness-temperature plane. We found that cold-start evolutionary models do not reproduce the mass-luminosity relation for sub-stellar companions in the BPMG. This aligns rather closely with predictions from 'hot start' scenarios and is consistent with recent planet formation models. We obtain rather good agreement with masses from photometry and the remapping approach compared to actual dynamical masses. We also found a strong suggestion that the near-infrared colour-magnitude diagram for young companions is different from that of free-floating objects belonging to the same young associations. If confirmed by further data, this last result would imply that cloud settling - which likely causes the transition between L and T spectral type - occurs at a lower effective temperature in young companions than in free-floating objects. This might tentatively be explained with a different chemical composition.
#### Vapor equilibrium models of accreting rocky planets demonstrate direct  core growth by pebble accretion

 - **Abstract**
 The gaseous envelope of an accreting rocky planet becomes hot enough to sublimate silicates and other refractory minerals. % aims heading (mandatory) For this work, we studied the effect of the resulting envelope enrichment with a heavy vapor species on the composition and temperature of the envelope. For simplification, we used the gas-phase molecule SiO to represent the sublimation of silicate material. We solved the equilibrium structure equations in 1D for planets in the mass range of $0.1$ to $3\,M_\oplus$. The convective stability criterion was extended to take the stabilizing effect of the condensation of SiO clouds into account. We assumed that the envelope is both in hydrostatic equilibrium and in vapor equilibrium with the underlying magma ocean. This means that pebbles do not undergo sublimation in the envelope and therefore survive until they plunge into the magma ocean. We find that the emergence of an inner radiative region, where SiO condensation suppresses convection, increases the pressure and temperature in the inner envelope compared to pure H$_2$/He envelopes once $M_\mathrm{pl} \gtrsim 0.3\,M_\oplus$. For $M_\mathrm{pl}>0.75\,M_\oplus$, the temperature and pressure close to the surface reach the supercritical point of SiO. The amount of SiO stored in the envelope is lower than the total planet mass for low mass planets. However, for $M_\mathrm{pl}>2.0\,M_\oplus$, all accreted pebble material must contribute to maintain the vapor equilibrium in the envelope. Therefore, the non-vapor mass of the planet ceases to increase beyond this threshold. Overall, our vapor equilibrium model of the planetary envelope allows for direct core growth by pebble accretion up to much higher masses than previously thought.
#### Chronology of our Galaxy from Gaia Colour-Magnitude Diagram-fitting  (ChronoGal). I. The formation and evolution of the thin disk from the Gaia  Catalogue of Nearby Stars

 - **Abstract**
 The current major challenge to reconstruct the chronology of the Milky Way (MW) is the difficulty to derive precise stellar ages. CMD-fitting offers an alternative to individual age determinations to derive the star formation history (SFH). We present CMDft.Gaia and use it to analyse the CMD of the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars (GCNS), which contains a census of the stars within 100 pc of the Sun. The result is an unprecedented detailed view of the evolution of the MW disk. The bulk of star formation started 11-10.5 Gyr ago at [Fe/H]~solar and continued with a slightly decreasing metallicity trend until 6 Gyr ago. Between 6-4 Gyr ago, a break in the age-metallicity distribution is observed, with 3 stellar populations with distinct metallicities (sub-solar, solar, and super-solar), possibly indicating some dramatic event in the Galaxy. Star formation resumed 4 Gyr ago with a bursty behaviour, metallicity near solar and higher average SFR. The derived metallicity distribution closely matches precise spectroscopic data, which also show stellar populations deviating from solar metallicity. Interestingly, our results reveal the presence of intermediate-age populations with both a metallicity typical of the thick disk and supersolar metallicity. Our many tests indicate that, with high precision Gaia photometric and distance data, CMDft.Gaia can achieve a precision ~10% and an accuracy better than 6% in the dating of even old stellar populations. The comparison with independent spectroscopic data shows that metallicity distributions are determined with high precision, without imposing a-priory metallicity information. This opens the door to obtaining detailed and robust information on the evolution of the stellar populations of the MW over cosmic time. As an example we provide an unprecedented detailed view of the age and metallicity distributions of the stars within 100 pc of the Sun.
#### Effects of physical conditions on the stellar initial mass function: The  low-metallicity star-forming region Sh 2-209

 - **Abstract**
 Recent work suggested that the variation of the initial mass function (IMF) of stars depends on the physical conditions, notably, the metallicity and gas density. We investigated the properties of two clusters, namely the main cluster (MC) and the subcluster (SC), in the low-metallicity HII region Sh 2-209 (S209) based on recently derived IMFs. We tested three previously published correlations using previous observations: the top-heaviness of the IMF in dependence on metallicity, the half-mass radius, and the most massive star in dependence on the stellar mass of the embedded clusters. For this region, two different galactocentric distances, namely 10.5 kpc and 18 kpc, were considered, where an age-distance-degeneracy was found for the previously determined IMF to be consistent with other formulated metallicity and density dependent IMFs. The determined half-mass radius (0.080 +/- 0.005) pc and the embedded cluster density (0.2 +/- 0.1) 10^6 Msun pc^-3 for the MC with an age of 0.5 Myr in S209 assuming a galactocentric distance of 18 kpc support the assumption that a low-metallicity environment results in a denser cluster, which leads to a top-heavy IMF. Thus, all three tests are consistent with the previously published correlations. The results for S209 are placed in the context with the IMF determination within the metal-poor cluster in the star-forming region NGC 346 in the Small Magellanic Cloud.
