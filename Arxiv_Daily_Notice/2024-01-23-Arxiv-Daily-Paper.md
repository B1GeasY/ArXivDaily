 - **Abstract**
 We consider a binary stellar system, in which a low-mass, of 0.6 Msun, carbon-oxygen white dwarf (WD) mergers with a degenerate helium core of 0.4 Msun of a red giant. We analyse the outcome of a merger within a common envelope (CE). We predict the observational properties of the resulting transient. We find that the double detonation of the WD, being a pure thermonuclear explosion and embedded into the hydrogen-rich CE, has a light curve with the distinct plateau shape, i.e. looks like a supernova (SN) Type IIP, with a duration of about 40 days. We find five observed SNe IIP: SN 2004dy, SN 2005af, SN 2005hd, SN 2007aa, and SN 2008bu, that match the V-band light curve of our models. Hence, we show that a thermonuclear explosion within a CE might be mistakenly identified as a SN IIP, which are believed to be an outcome of a core-collapse neutrino-driven explosion of a massive star. We discuss a number of diagnostics, that may help to distinguish this kind of a thermonuclear explosion from a core-collapse SN.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Elongated trails of infalling gas, often referred to as "streamers," have recently been observed around young stellar objects (YSOs) at different evolutionary stages. This asymmetric infall of material can significantly alter star and planet formation processes, especially in the more evolved YSOs. Aims. In order to ascertain the infalling nature of observed streamer-like structures and then systematically characterize their dynamics, we developed the code TIPSY (Trajectory of Infalling Particles in Streamers around Young stars). Methods. Using TIPSY, the streamer molecular line emission is first isolated from the disk emission. Then the streamer emission, which is effectively a point cloud in three-dimensional (3D) position-position-velocity space, is simplified to a curve-like representation. The observed streamer curve is then compared to the theoretical trajectories of infalling material. The best-fit trajectories are used to constrain streamer features, such as the specific energy, the specific angular momenta, the infall timescale, and the 3D morphology. Results. We used TIPSY to fit molecular-line ALMA observations of streamers around a Class II binary system, S CrA, and a Class I/II protostar, HL Tau. Our results indicate that both of the streamers are consistent with infalling motion. TIPSY results and mass estimates suggest that S CrA and HL Tau are accreting material at a rate of $\gtrsim27$ M$_{jupiter}$ Myr$^{-1}$ and $\gtrsim5$ M$_{jupiter}$ Myr$^{-1}$, respectively, which can significantly increase the mass budget available to form planets. Conclusions. TIPSY can be used to assess whether the morphology and kinematics of observed streamers are consistent with infalling motion and to characterize their dynamics, which is crucial for quantifying their impact on the protostellar systems.
#### Dust-gas dynamics driven by the streaming instability with various  pressure gradients

 - **Abstract**
 The streaming instability, a promising mechanism to drive planetesimal formation in dusty protoplanetary discs, relies on aerodynamic drag naturally induced by the background radial pressure gradient. This gradient should vary in disks, but its effect on the streaming instability has not been sufficiently explored. For this purpose, we use numerical simulations of an unstratified disc to study the non-linear saturation of the streaming instability with mono-disperse dust particles and survey a wide range of gradients for two distinct combinations of the particle stopping time and the dust-to-gas mass ratio. As the gradient increases, we find most kinematic and morphological properties increase but not always in linear proportion. The density distributions of tightly-coupled particles are insensitive to the gradient whereas marginally-coupled particles tend to concentrate by more than an order of magnitude as the gradient decreases. Moreover, dust-gas vortices for tightly-coupled particles shrink as the gradient decreases, and we note higher resolutions are required to trigger the instability in this case. In addition, we find various properties at saturation that depend on the gradient may be observable and may help reconstruct models of observed discs dominated by streaming turbulence. In general, increased dust diffusion from stronger gradients can lower the concentration of dust filaments and can explain the higher solid abundances needed to trigger strong particle clumping and the reduced planetesimal formation efficiency previously found in vertically-stratified simulations.
#### Theoretical modelling of the adsorption of neutral and charged  sulphur-bearing species on to olivine nanoclusters

 - **Abstract**
 Sulphur depletion in the interstellar medium (ISM) is a long-standing issue, as only 1% of its cosmic abundance is detected in dense molecular clouds (MCs), while it does not appear to be depleted in other environments. In addition to gas phase species, MCs also contain interstellar dust grains, which are irregular, micron-sized, solid aggregates of carbonaceous materials and/or silicates. Grains provide a surface where species can meet, accrete, and react. Although freeze-out of sulphur onto dust grains could explain its depletion, only OCS and, tentatively, SO$_2$ were observed on their surfaces. Therefore, it is our aim to investigate the interaction between sulphur-containing species and the exposed mineral core of the grains at a stage prior to when sulphur depletion is observed. Here, the grain core is represented by olivine nanoclusters, one of the most abundant minerals in the ISM, with composition Mg$_4$Si$_2$O$_8$ and Mg$_3$FeSi$_2$O$_8$. We performed a series of quantum mechanical calculations to characterize the adsorption of 9 S-bearing species, both neutral and charged, onto the nanoclusters. Our calculations reveal that the Fe-S interaction is preferred to Mg-S, causing sometimes the chemisorption of the adsorbate. These species are more strongly adsorbed on the bare dust grain silicate cores than on water ice mantles, and hence therefore likely sticking on the surface of grains forming part of the grain core. This demonstrates that the interaction of bare grains with sulphur species in cloud envelopes can determine the S-depletion observed in dense molecular clouds.
#### Testing Hadronic-Model Predictions of Depth of Maximum of Air-Shower  Profiles and Ground-Particle Signals using Hybrid Data of the Pierre Auger  Observatory
 - **Authors:** Authors: The Pierre Auger Collaboration
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10740
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10740
 - **Abstract**
 We test the predictions of hadronic interaction models regarding the depth of maximum of air-shower profiles, $X_{max}$, and ground-particle signals in water-Cherenkov detectors at 1000 m from the shower core, $S(1000)$, using the data from the fluorescence and surface detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The test consists in fitting the measured two-dimensional ($S(1000)$, $X_{max}$) distributions using templates for simulated air showers produced with hadronic interaction models EPOS-LHC, QGSJet II-04, Sibyll 2.3d and leaving the scales of predicted $X_{max}$ and the signals from hadronic component at ground as free fit parameters. The method relies on the assumption that the mass composition remains the same at all zenith angles, while the longitudinal shower development and attenuation of ground signal depend on the mass composition in a correlated way. The analysis was applied to 2239 events detected by both the fluorescence and surface detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory with energies between $10^{18.5}$ to $10^{19.0}$ eV and zenith angles below $60^\circ$. We found, that within the assumptions of the method, the best description of the data is achieved if the predictions of the hadronic interaction models are shifted to deeper $X_{max}$ values and larger hadronic signals at all zenith angles. Given the magnitude of the shifts and the data sample size, the statistical significance of the improvement of data description using the modifications considered in the paper is larger than $5\sigma$ even for any linear combination of experimental systematic uncertainties.

 - **Abstract**
 The unprecedented precision of Gaia has led to a paradigm shift in membership determination of open clusters where a variety of machine learning (ML) models can be employed. In this paper, we apply the unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to a sample of thirteen clusters with varying ages ($log \ t \approx$ 6.38-9.64) and distances (441-5183 pc) from Gaia DR3 data to determine membership. We use ASteca to determine parameters for the clusters from our revised membership data. We define a quantifiable metric Modified Silhouette Score (MSS) to evaluate its performance. We study the dependence of MSS on age, distance, extinction, galactic latitude and longitude, and other parameters to find the particular cases when GMM seems to be more efficient than other methods. We compared GMM for nine clusters with varying ages but we did not find any significant differences between GMM performance for younger and older clusters. But we found a moderate correlation between GMM performance and the cluster distance, where GMM works better for closer clusters. We find that GMM does not work very well for clusters at distances larger than 3~kpc.
#### Using Bayesian Inference to Distinguish Neutrino Flavor Conversion  Scenarios via a Prospective Supernova Neutrino Signal

 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming galactic core-collapse supernova is expected to produce a considerable number of neutrino events within terrestrial detectors. By using Bayesian inference techniques, we address the feasibility of distinguishing among various neutrino flavor conversion scenarios in the supernova environment, using such a neutrino signal. In addition to the conventional MSW, we explore several more sophisticated flavor conversion scenarios, such as spectral swapping, fast flavor conversions, flavor equipartition caused by non-standard neutrino interactions, magnetically-induced flavor equilibration, and flavor equilibrium resulting from slow flavor conversions. Our analysis demonstrates that with a sufficiently large number of neutrino events during the supernova accretion phase (exceeding several hundreds), there exists a good probability of distinguishing among feasible neutrino flavor conversion scenarios in the supernova environment.
