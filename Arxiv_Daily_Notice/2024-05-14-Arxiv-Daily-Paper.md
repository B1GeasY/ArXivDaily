 - **Abstract**
 We present a study illustrating the effects of the passage of a Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) mass satellite on the distance and velocity distributions of satellites in $\Lambda+$Cold Dark Matter simulations of Milky Way (MW) sized halos. In agreement with previous studies, we find that during such a passage the velocity distribution develops a high-velocity tail due to the reflex motion of the inner part of the halo, which can bias velocity-based virial halo mass estimates. When the velocity distribution of MW satellites is corrected for effects of the LMC passage, it is consistent with the distributions in halos of masses as low as $M_{\rm 200c}=8\times 10^{11}\, M_\odot$ and as high as $1.5\times 10^{12}\,M_\odot$. We present a new halo mass estimator $M_{\rm 200c}=c\sigma^2_{\rm 3D}r_{\rm med}$, where $c$ is a constant calibrated using satellite systems in the simulated MW-sized halos, $\sigma^2_{\rm 3D}$ is the variance of 3D velocities taken with the sign of the radial velocity of each satellite, and $r_{\rm med}$ is the median halocentric distance of the satellites. We show that the estimator has only $s=8\%$ scatter around the median relation of the estimated and true halo masses and deviates by $<2s$ from the median during the pericentric passage of an LMC-like subhalo. This is because $\sigma^2_{\rm 3D}$ and $r_{\rm med}$ deviate in opposite directions during such passages. We apply the estimator to the MW satellite system and estimate the virial mass of the Milky Way of $M_{\rm 200c}=9.96\pm 1.45\times 10^{11}\, M_\odot$, in good agreement with several recent estimates using other methods.

          Supernova Explosions of the Lowest-Mass Massive Star Progenitors

 - **Abstract**
 We here focus on the behavior of supernovae that technically explode in 1D (spherical symmetry). When simulated in 3D, however, the outcomes of representative progenitors of this class are quite different in almost all relevant quantities. In 3D, the explosion energies can be two to ten times higher, and there are correspondingly large differences in the $^{56}$Ni yields. These differences between the 3D and 1D simulations reflect in part the relative delay to explosion of the latter and in the former the presence of proto-neutron star convection that boosts the driving neutrino luminosities by as much as $\sim$50\% at later times. In addition, we find that the ejecta in 3D models are more neutron-rich, resulting in significant weak r-process and $^{48}$Ca yields. Furthermore, we find that in 3D the core is an interesting, though subdominant, source of acoustic power. In summary, we find that though a model might be found theoretically to explode in 1D, one must perform supernova simulations in 3D to capture most of the associated observables. The differences between 1D and 3D models are just too large to ignore.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary black holes (BBHs) born from the evolution of Population III (Pop. III) stars are one of the main high-redshift targets for next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. Their predicted initial mass function and lack of metals make them the ideal progenitors of black holes above the upper edge of the pair-instability mass gap, i.e. with a mass higher than $\approx{}134$ (241) M$_\odot$ for stars that become (do not become) chemically homogeneous during their evolution. Here, we investigate the effects of cluster dynamics on the mass function of BBHs born from Pop. III stars, by considering the main uncertainties on Pop. III star mass function, orbital properties of binary systems, star cluster's mass and disruption time. In our dynamical models, at least $\sim$5% and up to 100% BBH mergers in Pop. III star clusters have primary mass $m_1$ above the upper edge of the pair-instability mass gap. In contrast, only $\lesssim {} 3$% isolated BBH mergers have primary mass above the gap, unless their progenitors evolved as chemically homogeneous stars. The lack of systems with primary and/or secondary mass inside the gap defines a zone of avoidance with sharp boundaries in the primary mass - mass ratio plane. Finally, we estimate the merger rate density of BBHs and, in the most optimistic case, we find a maximum of $\mathcal{R}\approx200\,{\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$ at $z\sim15$ for BBHs formed via dynamical capture. For comparison, the merger rate density of isolated Pop. III BBHs is $\mathcal{R}\leq{}10\,{\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$, for the same model of Pop. III star formation history.

 - **Abstract**
 The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Gamma-Ray Observatory located on the side of the Sierra Negra volcano in Mexico, has been fully operational since 2015. The HAWC collaboration has recently significantly improved their extensive-air-shower reconstruction algorithms, which has notably advanced the observatory performance. The energy resolution for primary gamma rays with energies below 1~TeV was improved by including a noise-suppression algorithm. Corrections have also been made to systematic errors in direction fitting related to the detector and shower plane inclinations, $\mathcal{O}(0.1^{\circ})$ biases in highly inclined showers, as well as enhancements to the core reconstruction. The angular resolution for gamma rays approaching the HAWC array from large zenith angles ($> 37^{\circ}$) has improved by a factor of four at the highest energies ($> 70$~TeV) as compared to previous reconstructions. The inclusion of a lateral distribution function fit to the extensive air shower footprint on the array to separate gamma-ray primaries from cosmic-ray ones, based on the resulting $\chi^{2}$ values, improved the background rejection performance at all inclinations. At large zenith angles, the improvement in significance is a factor of four compared to previous HAWC publications. These enhancements have been verified by observing the Crab Nebula, which is an overhead source for the HAWC Observatory. We show that the sensitivity to Crab-like point sources ($E^{-2.63}$) with locations overhead to 30$^{\circ}$ zenith is comparable or less than 10\% of the Crab Nebula's flux between 2 and 50~TeV. Thanks to these improvements, HAWC can now detect more sources, including the Galactic Center.
#### Title:
          Birth and Evolution of Fast Radio Bursts: Strong Population-Based Evidence for a Neutron-Star Origin

 - **Abstract**
 While the appeal of their extraordinary radio luminosity to our curiosity is undiminished, the nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs) has remained unclear. The challenge has been due in part to small sample sizes and limited understanding of telescope selection effects. We here present the first inclusion of the entire set of one-off FRBs from CHIME/FRB Catalog 1 in frbpoppy. Where previous work had to curate this data set, and fit for few model parameters, we have developed full multi-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) capabilities for frbpoppy -- the comprehensive, open-science FRB population synthesis code -- that allow us to include all one-off CHIME bursts. Through the combination of these two advances we now find the best description of the real, underlying FRB population, with higher confidence than before. We show that $4\pm3\times10^{3}$ one-off FRBs go off every second between Earth and $z$=1; and we provide a mock catalog based on our best model, for straight-forward inclusion in other studies. We investigate CHIME side-lobe detection fractions, and FRB luminosity characteristics, to show that some bright, local FRBs are still being missed. We find strong evidence that FRB birth rates evolve with the star formation rate of the Universe, even with a hint of a short (0.1$-$1 Gyr) delay time. The preferred contribution of the hosts to the FRB dispersion agrees with a progenitor birth location in the host disk. This population-based evidence solidly aligns with magnetar-like burst sources, and we conclude FRBs are emitted by neutron stars.

          Phosphorus enrichment by ONe novae in the Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have shown that [P/Fe] in the Galactic stars decreases with increasing [Fe/H] for [Fe/H] > -1 whereas it is almost subsolar for [Fe/H]< -2. These [P/Fe] trends with [Fe/H] have not been well reproduced by previous theoretical models incorporating phosphorus (P) enrichment only by core collapse supernoave. We here show, for the first time, that the trends can be naturally explained by our new models incorporating P enrichment by oxygen-neon (ONe) novae which occur at the surface of massive white dwarfs whose masses are larger than 1.25 M_sun with a metallicity-dependence rate. We also show that the observations can be better reproduced by the models by assuming that (i) the total mass of gaseous ejecta per ONe nov (M_ej) is as high as 4 * 10^{-5} M_sun and (ii) the number of such novae per unit mass (N_ONe) is as large as 0.01 at [Fe/H]~-3. The assumed M_ej is consistent with observations, and the high N_ONe is expected from recent theoretical models for ONe nova fractions. We predict that (i) [P/Fe] increases with increasing [Fe/H] for -2 < [Fe/H] < -1 and (ii) [P/Fe] and [Cl/Fe] trends with [Fe/H] are very similar with each other due to very large yields of P and Cl from ONe nova. It is thus worthwhile for future observations to assess the validity of the proposed P enrichment by ONe novae by confirming or ruling out these two predictions.
#### Title:
          The Coupled Impacts of Atmospheric Composition and Obliquity on the Climate Dynamics of TRAPPIST-1e

 - **Abstract**
 Planets in multi-planet systems are expected to migrate inward as near-resonant chains, thus allowing them to undergo gravitational planet-planet interactions and possibly maintain a non-zero obliquity. The TRAPPIST-1 system is in such a near-resonant configuration, making it plausible that TRAPPIST-1e has a non-zero obliquity. In this work, we use the ExoCAM GCM to study the possible climates of TRAPPIST-1e at varying obliquities and atmospheric compositions. We vary obliquity from 0$^\circ$ to 90$^\circ$ and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide from 0.0004 bars (modern Earth-like) to 1 bar. We find that models with a higher obliquity are hotter overall and have a smaller day-night temperature contrast than the lower obliquity models, which is consistent with previous studies. Most significantly, the super-rotating high-altitude jet becomes sub-rotating at high obliquity, thus impacting cloud and surface temperature patterns. As the amount of carbon dioxide increases, the climate of TRAPPIST-1e becomes hotter, cloudier, and less variable. From modeled thermal phase curves, we find that the impact of obliquity could potentially have observable consequences due to the effect of cloud coverage on the outgoing longwave radiation.
