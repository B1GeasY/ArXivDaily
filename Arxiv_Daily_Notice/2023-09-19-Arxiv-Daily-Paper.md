 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the evolution of cosmic filaments across redshift with emphasis on some important properties: filament lengths, growth rates, and radial profiles of galaxy densities. Following an observation-driven approach, we build cosmic filament catalogues at z=0,1,2,3 and 4 from the galaxy distributions of the large hydro-dynamical run of the MilleniumTNG project. We employ the extensively used DisPerSE cosmic web finder code, for which we provide a user-friendly guide, including the details of a physics-driven calibration procedure, with the hope of helping future users. We perform the first statistical measurements of the evolution of connectivity in a large-scale simulation, finding that the connectivity of cosmic nodes (defined as the number of filaments attached) globally decreases from early to late times. The study of cosmic filaments in proper coordinates reveals that filaments grow in length and radial extent, as expected from large-scale structures in an expanding Universe. But the most interesting results arise once the Hubble flow is factored out. We find remarkably stable comoving filament length functions and over-density profiles, showing only little evolution of the total population of filaments in the past ~12.25 Gyrs. However, by tracking the spatial evolution of individual structures, we demonstrate that filaments of different lengths actually follow different evolutionary paths. While short filaments preferentially contract, long filaments expand along their longitudinal direction with growth rates that are the highest in the early, matter dominated Universe. Filament diversity at fixed redshift is also shown by the different (~$5 \sigma$) density values between the shortest and longest filaments. Our results hint that cosmic filaments can be used as additional probes for dark energy, but further theoretical work is still needed.
#### Optimal Fitting, Debiasing, and Cosmic Ray Rejection for Detectors Read  Out Up-the-Ramp

 - **Abstract**
 This paper derives the optimal fit to a pixel's count rate in the case of an ideal detector read out nondestructively in the presence of both read and photon noise. The approach is general for any readout scheme, provides closed-form expressions for all quantities, and has a computational cost that is linear in the number of resultants (groups of reads). I also derive the bias of the fit from estimating the covariance matrix and show how to remove it to first order. The ramp-fitting algorithm I describe provides the $\chi^2$ value of the fit of a line to the accumulated counts, enabling hypothesis testing for cosmic ray hits using the entire ramp. I show that this approach can be substantially more sensitive than one that only uses the difference between sequential resultants, especially for long ramps and for jumps that occur in the middle of a group of reads. It can also be implemented for a computational cost that is linear in the number of resultants. I provide and describe a pure Python implementation of these algorithms that can process a 10-resultant ramp on a $4096 \times 4096$ detector in $\approx$8 seconds with bias removal, or in $\approx$20 seconds including iterative cosmic ray detection and removal, on a single core of a 2020 Macbook Air. This Python implementation, together with tests and a tutorial notebook, are available at https://github.com/t-brandt/fitramp.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent measurements of the spectral intensities of cosmic-ray nuclei have suggested that the ratio of Boron to Carbon nuclei, $R(E)$, comprises two components, one which carries all of the energy dependence and the other a constant independent of energy per nucleon. This supports the earlier theoretical expectations and results of gamma-ray astronomy that one of these components is attributable to spallation in a cocoon like region surrounding the sources and the other in the general interstellar medium before cosmic rays leak away from the Galaxy. A new way of analyzing cosmic-ray spectra is presented here to shed light on the recent findings: based solely on the assumption that the B nuclei in cosmic rays are entirely the products of spallation of heavier nuclei, we solve a cascade of propagation equations to derive both the source-spectra of p, C, O, and Fe nuclei prior to any spallation effects and the energy dependence of the leakage lifetime, $\tau(E)$, implied by the energy dependence of $R(E)$. We find that the source spectra of these nuclei are nearly power laws with the same index, in the nested leaky-box model where the energy-dependent part of the matter is traversed in a cocoon surrounding the sources, and the constant part of the traversal is in the interstellar medium. This is not the case for the alternate choice with the grammage in the sources being a constant. We briefly discuss our results and comment on some aspects of cosmic-ray propagation.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation is underway in the W49N molecular cloud (MC) at a high level of efficiency, with almost twenty ultra-compact (UC) HII regions observed thus far, indicating a recent formation of massive stars. Previous works have suggested that this cloud is undergoing a global contraction. We analyse the data on OH masers in the molecular cloud W49N, observed with the VLBA at the 1612, 1665, and 1667 MHz transitions in LCP and RCP with an aim to study the global kinematics of the masers. We carried out our study based on the locations and observed velocities of the maser spots. The velocities were fitted to the straight line of V$_{obs}$-V$_{sys}$ versus d$_{(\alpha, \delta)m}$, resulting in V$_{ftd}$. The difference between the fitted values and those obtained from observations is $\Delta $V. The V$_{obs}$-V$_{sys}$ velocity shows a gradient as a function of the distance to ($\alpha, \delta$)$_{m}$, where the closer spots have the largest velocities. Spots with similar velocities are located in different sectors, with respect to ($\alpha, \delta$)$_{m}$. Then, we assumed that the spots are moving towards a contraction centre (CC$_{OH}$), which is at the apex of a CONUS. We also assumed that the distance of each spot to CC$_{OH}$ is d$_{cc}$ and that they fall with a velocity V$_{CC}$, with the total velocity being V$_{Tot}$. Using this velocity, we estimated the free-fall velocity. The observed dispersion with respect to the global trend against $d_{cc}$, shows a maximum at 0.12 pc, with a decay from 0.12 to 0.19 pc, which is faster than that taking place between 0.19 and 0.42 pc. Based on $V_{tot}$ an inner mass of M$_{inn}$=2500 $M_{\odot}$ was estimated.The velocities of the OH spots at W49N, together with their positions respect $(\alpha, \delta)_m$, make it possible to trace a global kinematics, which seems to be due to a subcollapse in the W49N molecular cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 According to the structures traced by $^{13}$CO spectral lines within the $^{12}$CO molecular clouds (MCs), we investigate the contributions of their internal gas motions and relative motions to the total velocity dispersions of $^{12}$CO MCs. Our samples of 2851 $^{12}$CO MCs harbor a total of 9556 individual $^{13}$CO structures, among which 1848 MCs ($\sim$ 65$\%$) have one individual $^{13}$CO structure and the other 1003 MCs ($\sim$ 35$\%$) have multiple $^{13}$CO structures. We find that the contribution of the relative motion between $^{13}$CO structures ($\sigma_{\rm ^{13}CO, re}$) is larger than that from their internal gas motion ($\sigma_{\rm ^{13}CO, in}$) in $\sim$ 62$\%$ of 1003 MCs in the `multiple' regime. In addition, we find the $\sigma_{\rm ^{13}CO, re}$ tends to increase with the total velocity dispersion($\sigma_{\rm ^{12}CO, tot}$) in our samples, especially for the MCs having multiple $^{13}$CO structures. This result provides a manifestation of the macro-turbulent within MCs, which gradually becomes the dominant way to store the kinetic energy along with the development of MC scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiwavelength photometry of the secondary eclipses of extrasolar planets is able to disentangle the reflected and thermally emitted light radiated from the planetary dayside. This leads to the measurement of the planetary geometric albedo $A_g$, which is an indicator of the presence of clouds in the atmosphere, and the recirculation efficiency $\epsilon$, which quantifies the energy transport within the atmosphere. In this work we aim to measure $A_g$ and $\epsilon$ for the planet WASP-178 b, a highly irradiated giant planet with an estimated equilibrium temperature of 2450 K.} We analyzed archival spectra and the light curves collected by Cheops and Tess to characterize the host WASP-178, refine the ephemeris of the system and measure the eclipse depth in the passbands of the two respective telescopes. We measured a marginally significant eclipse depth of 70$\pm$40 ppm in the Tess passband and statistically significant depth of 70$\pm$20 ppm in the Cheops passband. Combining the eclipse depth measurement in the Cheops (lambda_eff=6300 AA) and Tess (lambda_eff=8000 AA) passbands we constrained the dayside brightness temperature of WASP-178 b in the 2250-2800 K interval. The geometric albedo 0.1<$\rm A_g$<0.35 is in general agreement with the picture of poorly reflective giant planets, while the recirculation efficiency $\epsilon>$0.7 makes WASP-178 b an interesting laboratory to test the current heat recirculation models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an algorithm to derive difference images for data taken with the JWST with matched PSFs. It is based on the SFFT method but with revisions to accommodate the rotations and spatial variations of the Point Spread Functions (PSFs). It allows for spatially varying kernels in B-spline form with separately controlled photometric scaling and Tikhonov kernel regularization for harnessing the ultimate fitting flexibility. We present this method using the JWST/NIRCam images of Abell cluster 2744 acquired in JWST Cycle 1 as the test data. The algorithm can be useful for time-domain source detection and differential photometry with the JWST. It can also co-add images of multiple exposures taken at different field orientations. The co-added images preserve the sharpness of the central cores of the PSFs, and the positions and shapes of the objects are matched precisely with B-splines across the field.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a data-driven model for abundances of Fe, Sr, Ba, and Eu in metal-poor (MP) stars. The production patterns for core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs) are derived from the data of Holmbeck et al. (arXiv:2007.00749) on [Sr/Fe], [Ba/Fe], and [Eu/Fe] for 195 stars. Nearly all the data can be accounted for by mixtures of contributions from these two sources. We find that on average, the Sr contribution to an MP star from BNSMs is $\approx 3$ times that from CCSNe. Our model is also consistent with the solar inventory of Fe, Sr, Ba, and Eu. We carry out a parametric $r$-process study to explore the conditions that can give rise to our inferred production patterns and find that such conditions are largely consistent with those from simulations of CCSNe and BNSMs. Our model can be greatly enhanced by accurate abundances of many $r$-process elements in a large number of MP stars, and future results from this approach can be used to probe the conditions in CCSNe and BNSMs in much more detail.

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical and near-infrared observations of SN~2022crv, a stripped envelope supernova in NGC~3054, discovered within 12 hrs of explosion by the Distance Less Than 40 Mpc Survey. We suggest SN~2022crv is a transitional object on the continuum between SNe Ib and SNe IIb. A high-velocity hydrogen feature ($\sim$$-$20,000 -- $-$16,000 $\rm km\,s^{-1}$) was conspicuous in SN~2022crv at early phases, and then quickly disappeared around maximum light. By comparing with hydrodynamic modeling, we find that a hydrogen envelope of $\sim 10^{-3}$ \msun{} can reproduce the behaviour of the hydrogen feature observed in SN~2022crv. The early light curve of SN~2022crv did not show envelope cooling emission, implying that SN~2022crv had a compact progenitor with extremely low amount of hydrogen. The analysis of the nebular spectra shows that SN~2022crv is consistent with the explosion of a He star with a final mass of $\sim$4.5 -- 5.6 \msun{} that has evolved from a $\sim$16 -- 22 \msun{} zero-age main sequence star in a binary system with about 1.0 -- 1.7 \msun{} of oxygen finally synthesized in the core. The high metallicity at the supernova site indicates that the progenitor experienced a strong stellar wind mass loss. In order to retain a small amount of residual hydrogen at such a high metallicity, the initial orbital separation of the binary system is likely larger than $\sim$1000~$\rm R_{\odot}$. The near-infrared spectra of SN~2022crv show a unique absorption feature on the blue side of He I line at $\sim$1.005~$\mu$m. This is the first time that such a feature has been observed in a Type Ib/IIb, and could be due to \ion{Sr}{2}. Further detailed modelling on SN~2022crv can shed light on the progenitor and the origin of the mysterious absorption feature in the near infrared.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of molecular line observations performed toward the NGC 2068 and NGC 2071 regions of the Orion B cloud as the TRAO-FUNS project to study the roles of the filamentary structure in the formation of dense cores and stars in the clouds. Gaussian decomposition for the C$^{18}$O spectra with multiple velocity components and application of a Friends-of-Friends algorithm for the decomposed components allowed us to identify a few tens of velocity coherent filaments. We also identified 48 dense cores from the observations of N$_2$H$^{+}$ using a core finding tool, FellWalker. We made the virial analysis for these filaments and dense cores, finding that the filaments with N$_2$H$^{+}$ dense core are thermally supercritical, and the filaments with larger ratio between the line mass and the thermal critical line mass tend to have more dense cores. We investigated the contribution of the nonthermal motions in dense cores and filaments, showing the dense cores are mostly in transonic/subsonic motions while their natal filaments are mostly in supersonic motions. This may indicates that gas turbulent motions in the filaments have been dissipated at the core scale to form the dense cores there. The filaments with (dynamically evolved) dense cores in infalling motions or with NH$_2$D bright (or chemically evolved) dense cores are all found to be gravitationally critical. Therefore, the criticality of the filament is thought to provide a key condition for its fragmentation, the formation of dense cores, and their kinematical and chemical evolution.
#### The Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments:  CASCADE. II. A detailed kinematic analysis of the DR21 Main outflow

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular outflows are believed to be a key ingredient in the process of star formation. The molecular outflow associated with DR21 Main in Cygnus-X is one of the most extreme, in mass and size, molecular outflows in the Milky Way. The outflow is suggested to belong to a rare class of explosive outflows which are formed by the disintegration of protostellar systems.We aim to explore the morphology, kinematics,and energetics of the DR21 Main outflow, and compare those properties to confirmed explosive outflows to unravel the underlying driving mechanism behind DR21. Line and continuum emission are studied at a wavelength of 3.6\,mm with IRAM 30 m and NOEMA telescopes as part of the Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments (CASCADE) program. The spectra include ($J= 1-0$) transitions of HCO$^+$, HCN, HNC, N$_2$H$^+$, H$_2$CO, CCH tracing different temperature and density regimes of the outflowing gas at high-velocity resolution ($\sim$ 0.8 km s$^{-1}$). The map encompasses the entire DR21 Main outflow and covers all spatial scales down to a resolution of ~3" ($\sim$ 0.02 pc). Integrated intensity maps of the HCO$^+$ emission reveal a strongly collimated bipolar outflow with significant overlap of the blue- and red-shifted emission. The opening angles of both outflow lobes decrease with velocity, from $\sim80$ to 20$^{\circ}$ for the velocity range from 5 to 45 km s$^{-1}$ relative to the source velocity. No evidence is found for the presence of elongated, "filament-like" structures expected in explosive outflows. N$_2$H$^+$ emission near the western outflow lobe reveals the presence of a dense molecular structure which appears to be interacting with the DR21 Main outflow. The overall morphology as well as the detailed kinematics of the DR21 Main outflow is more consistent with that of a typical bipolar outflow instead of an explosive counterpart.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of TOI-1420b, an exceptionally low-density ($\rho = 0.08\pm0.02$ g cm$^{-3}$) transiting planet in a $P = 6.96$ day orbit around a late G dwarf star. Using transit observations from TESS, LCOGT, OPM, Whitin, Wendelstein, OAUV, Ca l'Ou, and KeplerCam along with radial velocity observations from HARPS-N and NEID, we find that the planet has a radius of $R_p$ = 11.9 $\pm$ 0.3 $R_\Earth$ and a mass of $M_p$ = 25.1 $\pm$ 3.8 $M_\Earth$. TOI-1420b is the largest-known planet with a mass less than $50M_\Earth$, indicating that it contains a sizeable envelope of hydrogen and helium. We determine TOI-1420b's envelope mass fraction to be $f_{env} = 82^{+7}_{-6}\%$, suggesting that runaway gas accretion occurred when its core was at most $4-5\times$ the mass of the Earth. TOI-1420b is similar to the planet WASP-107b in mass, radius, density, and orbital period, so a comparison of these two systems may help reveal the origins of close-in low-density planets. With an atmospheric scale height of 1950 km, a transmission spectroscopy metric of 580, and a predicted Rossiter-McLaughlin amplitude of about $17$ m s$^{-1}$, TOI-1420b is an excellent target for future atmospheric and dynamical characterization.
