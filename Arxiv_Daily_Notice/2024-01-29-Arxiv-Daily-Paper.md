 - **Abstract**
 The nearby long-duration GRB 191019A recently detected by {\em Swift} lacks an associated supernova and belongs to a host galaxy with little star formation activity, suggesting that the origin of this burst is the result of the merger of two compact objects with dynamical interactions in a high-density medium of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). By motivating of this event, it occurs in such high-density environment, the ejecta- circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction cannot be ignored to contribute a possible kilonova emission. Here, we theoretically calculate the kilonova emission by considering the contribution of the ejecta-CSM interaction in the high-density environment. We find that the contribution to the kilonova emission from the ejecta-CSM interaction will dominate at a later time, and a smaller ejecta mass will have a stronger kilonova emission from the ejecta-CSM interaction. Moreover, we try to apply it to GRB 191019A, but we find that it is difficult to identify the possible kilonova emission from the observations due to the contribution of the bright host galaxy. On the other hand, it requires a less injected mass (less than $M_{\rm ej}=2\times10^{-5}M_{\odot}$) if one can detect the kilonova emission associated with a GRB 191019A-like event in the future. The r-process-powered and spin energy contributions from the magnetar are also discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Considering ten well-known relativistic mean field models, we invoke feeble interaction between hadronic matter and fermionic dark matter (DM) $\chi$ via new physics scalar ($\phi$) and vector ($\xi$) mediators in neutron star core, thereby forming DM admixed neutron stars (DMANSs). The chosen masses of the DM fermion ($m_{\chi}$) and the mediators ($m_{\phi}$ and $m_{\xi}$) are consistent with the self-interaction constraint from Bullet cluster while their respective couplings ($y_{\phi}$ and $y_{\xi}$) are also constrained by the present day relic abundance. Assuming that both $\phi$ and $\xi$ contribute equally to the relic abundance, we compute the equation of state of the DMANSs and consequently their structural properties. We found that for a particular (constant) DM density, the presence of lighter DM results in more massive DMANSs with larger radius. In the light of the various recent constraints like those from the massive pulsar PSR J0740+6620, the gravitational wave (GW170817) data and the results of NICER experiments for PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, we provide a bound on $m_{\chi}$ within the framework of the present work as $m_{\chi}\approx$ (0.1 $-$ 30) GeV for a wide range of fixed DM Fermi momenta $k_F^{\chi}$=(0.01 $-$ 0.06) GeV. In the case of the hadronic models that yield larger radii corresponding to the low mass neutron stars in the no-DM scenario, interaction with comparatively heavier DM fermion is necessary in order to ensure that the DMANSs obtained with such models satisfy the radius constraints from both GW170817 and NICER data for PSR J0030+0451.

 - **Abstract**
 Evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background, plausibly originating from the merger of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), is accumulating with observations from pulsar timing arrays. An outstanding question is how inspiraling SMBHs get past the "final parsec" of separation, where they have a tendency to stall before GW emission alone can make the binary coalesce. We argue that dynamical friction from the dark matter (DM) spike surrounding the black holes is sufficient to resolve this puzzle, if the DM has a self-interaction cross section of order $0.2-5\,$cm$^2$/g. The same effect leads to a softening of the GW spectrum at low frequencies as suggested by the current data. For collisionless cold DM, the friction deposits so much energy that the spike is disrupted and cannot bridge the final parsec, while for self-interacting DM, the isothermal core of the halo can act as a reservoir for the energy liberated from the SMBH orbits. A realistic velocity dependence, such as generated by the exchange of a massive mediator like a dark photon, is favored to give a good fit to the GW spectrum while providing a large enough core. A similar velocity dependence has been advocated for solving the small-scale structure problems of cold DM.

 - **Abstract**
 We study young massive clusters (YMCs) in their embedded "infant" phase with $\sim$0.1" ALMA, HST, and JWST observations targeting the central starburst ring in NGC 3351, a nearby Milky Way analog galaxy. Our new ALMA data reveal 18 bright and compact (sub-)millimeter continuum sources, of which 11 have apparent counterparts in JWST images and only 6 have counterparts in HST images. Based on the ALMA continuum and molecular line data, as well as ancillary measurements for the HST and JWST counterparts, we identify 14 sources as infant star clusters with high stellar and/or gas masses (${\sim}10^5\;\mathrm{M_\odot}$), small radii (${\lesssim}\,5\;\mathrm{pc}$), large escape velocities ($6{-}10\;\mathrm{km/s}$), and short free-fall times ($0.5{-}1\;\mathrm{Myr}$). Their multiwavelength properties motivate us to divide them into four categories, likely corresponding to four evolutionary stages from starless clumps to exposed HII region-cluster complexes. Leveraging age estimates for HST-identified clusters in the same region, we infer an evolutionary timeline going from $1{-}2\;\mathrm{Myr}$ before cluster formation as starless clumps, to $4{-}6\;\mathrm{Myr}$ after as exposed HII region-cluster complexes. Finally, we show that the YMCs make up a substantial fraction of recent star formation across the ring, exhibit an non-uniform azimuthal distribution without a very coherent evolutionary trend along the ring, and are capable of driving large-scale gas outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 We estimate the mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using the kinematics of 30 LMC globular clusters (GCs). We combine proper motions (PMs) measured with HST, Gaia, or a combination of the two, from a recent study by Bennet et al. (2022) with literature line-of-sight velocities (LOSVs) to give 3 components of motion. With these, we derive a 3D velocity dispersion anisotropy $\beta = -0.72 ^{+0.62} _{-1.07}$, consistent with the GCs forming a flattened system with significant azimuthal motion. We then apply a tracer mass estimator and measure an enclosed mass $M (<13.2 \mathrm{kpc})= 2.66^{+0.42} _{-0.36} \times 10^{10} \mathrm{M}_\odot$. This is broadly consistent with results from previous studies of the LOSVs of GCs and other luminous tracers. Assuming a cosmologically-constrained NFW distribution for the dark matter, this implies a virial mass $M_\mathrm{virial} = 1.80^{+1.05} _{-0.54} \times 10^{11} \mathrm{M}_\odot$. Despite being an extrapolation by almost an order of magnitude in radius, this result is consistent with published estimates from other methods that are directly sensitive to the LMC's total mass. Our results support the conclusion that the LMC is approximately 17$^{+10}_{-6}$% of the Milky Way's mass, making it a significant contributor to the Local Group (LG) potential.

 - **Abstract**
 The red hypergiant VY CMa is famous for its very visible record of high mass loss events. Recent CO observations with ALMA revealed three previously unknown large scale outflows (Paper I). In this paper we use the CO maps to investigate the motions of a cluster of four clumps close to the star, not visible in the optical or infrared images. We present their proper motions measured from two epochs of ALMA images and determine the line of sight velocities of the gas in emission at the clumps. We estimate their masses and ages, or time since ejection, and conclude that all four were ejected during VY CMa's active period in the early 20th century. Together with two additional knots observed with HST, VY CMa experienced at least six massive outflows during a 30 year period with a total mass lost greater than 0.07 Msun. The position-velocity map of the $^{12}$CO emission reveals previously unnoticed attributes of the older outer ejecta. In a very narrow range of Doppler velocities, $^{12}$CO absorption and emission causes some of this outer material to be quite opaque. At those frequencies the inner structure is hidden and we see only emission from an extended outer region. This fact produces a conspicuous but illusory dark spot if one attempts to subtract the continuum in a normal way.

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST spectral and photometric observations of the Type IIP supernova (SN) 2022acko at ~50 days past explosion. These data are the first JWST spectral observations of a core-collapse SN. We identify ~30 different H I features, other features associated with products produced from the CNO cycle, and s-process elements such as Sc II and Ba II. By combining the JWST spectra with ground-based optical and NIR spectra, we construct a full Spectral Energy Distribution from 0.4 to 25 microns and find that the JWST spectra are fully consistent with the simultaneous JWST photometry. The data lack signatures of CO formation and we estimate a limit on the CO mass of < 10^{-8} solar mass. We demonstrate how the CO fundamental band limits can be used to probe underlying physics during stellar evolution, explosion, and the environment. The observations indicate little mixing between the H envelope and C/O core in the ejecta and show no evidence of dust. The data presented here set a critical baseline for future JWST observations, where possible molecular and dust formation may be seen.

 - **Abstract**
 High-latitude ($|b|>30^{\circ}$) molecular clouds have virial parameters that exceed 1, but whether these clouds can form stars has not been studied systematically. Using JCMT SCUBA-2 archival data, we surveyed 70 fields that target high-latitude Planck galactic cold clumps (HLPCs) to find dense cores with density of $10^{5}$-$10^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$ and size of $<0.1$ pc. The sample benefits from both the representativeness of the parent sample and covering densest clumps at the high column density end ($>1\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$). At an average noise rms of 15 mJy/beam, we detected Galactic dense cores in only one field, G6.04+36.77 (L183), while also identifying 12 extragalactic objects and two young stellar objects. Compared to the low-latitude clumps, dense cores are scarce in HLPCs. With synthetic observations, the densities of cores are constrained to be $n_c\lesssim10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, should they exist in HLPCs. Low-latitude clumps, Taurus clumps, and HLPCs form a sequence where a higher virial parameter corresponds to a lower dense core detection rate. If HLPCs were affected by the Local Bubble, the scarcity should favor turbulence-inhibited rather than supernova-driven star formation. Studies of the formation mechanism of the L183 molecular cloud are warranted.
#### Variable white dwarfs in TMTS: Asteroseismological analysis of a ZZ Ceti  star, TMTS J17184064+2524314

 - **Abstract**
 The Tsinghua University-Ma Huateng Telescope for Survey (TMTS) has been constantly monitoring the northern sky since 2020 in search of rapidly variable stars. To find variable white dwarfs (WDs), the TMTS catalog is cross-matched with the WD catalog of Gaia EDR3, resulting in over 3000 light curves of WD candidates. The WD TMTS J17184064+2524314 (hereafter J1718) is the second ZZ~Ceti star discovered among these common sources. Based on the light curves from TMTS, follow-up photometric observations, and TESS, 10 periods and 3 combination periods are detected. A rotation period of $25.12\pm0.18$ hr is derived, according to the identified rotational splitting. Our spectroscopic observation indicates that this WD belongs to DA type with $T_{\rm eff}=11,670\pm604$ K, log $g=8.16\pm0.36$, $M = 0.70\pm0.23$ M$_{\odot}$, and age=$0.51\pm0.34$ Gyr. Based on core-parameterized asteroseismological model grids ($\geqslant$ 14 million), we derive a best-fit solution of $T_{\rm eff}=11,640\pm20$ K, log $g=8.267\pm0.008$, and $M = 0.750\pm0.005$ M$_{\odot}$ for J1718, consistent with the spectral fitting results. For this WD, the corresponding carbon and oxygen abundances in the core are 0.43 and 0.57, respectively. The distance derived from the intrinsic luminosity given by asteroseismology is $64\pm15$ pc, in accord with the distance of $70.1\pm0.2$ pc from Gaia DR3 within the uncertainties.
#### Thermal and kinetic coronal rain diagnostics with MgII h & k lines

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14859
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14859
 - **Abstract**
 We performed the temperature diagnostics using inversions of data from nine spectroscopic observations obtained with the IRIS spectrograph in the MgII h & k lines. The sensitivity to the temperature of the emission peaks of these lines was exploited to determine the temperature of the coronal rain plasma using inversions of the spectroscopic profiles. Additional relationships between different spectral features of these lines, derived from the use of 3D radiative transfer line synthesis applied to simulations, were employed in order to derive the line-of-sight (LoS) velocities in different parts of the coronal rain plasma. For the first time, spectroscopic inversions of coronal rain were successfully performed. Temperatures derived from the inversions yield coronal rain clump temperatures at the formation height of the emission peaks of the MgII h & k lines in the range between 5000 and 7000 K. This narrow range of values remains consistent among all the different observations used in this work. We obtained LoS velocities of up to 40 km/s, which are consistent with the motion of the plasma being mostly constrained to the plane of the sky, as the coronal rain was mostly detected shortly after its formation and the observations took place in the disc. Furthermore, velocity diagnostics led to the detection of larger velocities at higher layers of the coronal rain plasma in some cases. This increased velocity seems to indicate that at some point (at least) during the fall of coronal rain clumps towards the chromosphere, the material in the upper part of the coronal rain plasma is falling with greater velocity than the material below it. The conditions of the temperature and density of the coronal rain plasma where the Mg II h line forms appear to be slightly different that those of the Mg II k line, with the former found at slightly colder and denser parts of the plasma.
#### The JWST Resolved Stellar Populations Early Release Science Program VI.  Identifying Evolved Stars in Nearby Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We present an investigation of evolved stars in the nearby star-forming galaxy WLM, using NIRCam imaging from the JWST resolved stellar populations early-release science (ERS) program. We find that various combinations of the F090W, F150W, F250M, and F430M filters can effectively isolate red supergiants (RSGs) and thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stars from one another, while also providing a reasonable separation of the primary TP-AGB subtypes: carbon-rich C-type stars and oxygen-rich M-type stars. The classification scheme we present here agrees very well with the well-established Hubble Space Telescope (HST) medium-band filter technique. The ratio of C to M-type stars (C/M) is 0.8$\pm$0.1 for both the new JWST and the HST classifications, which is within one sigma of empirical predictions from optical narrow-band CN and TiO filters. The evolved star colors show good agreement with the predictions from the PARSEC$+$COLIBRI stellar evolutionary models, and the models indicate a strong metallicity dependence that makes stellar identification even more effective at higher metallicity. However, the models also indicate that evolved star identification with NIRCam may be more difficult at lower metallicies. We test every combination of NIRCam filters using the models and present additional filters that are also useful for evolved star studies. We also find that $\approx$90\% of the dusty evolved stars are carbon-rich, suggesting that carbonaceous dust dominates the present-day dust production in WLM, similar to the findings in the Magellanic Clouds. These results demonstrate the usefulness of NIRCam in identifying and classifying dust-producing stars without the need for mid-infrared data.

 - **Abstract**
 The highly sensitive millimeter-wave telescope is an important tool for accurate measurement of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, and its core component is a detector array located in a cryogenic focal plane. The feasibility of utilizing thermal kinetic inductance detectors (TKIDs) for CMB observations has been demonstrated. We propose a pixel design of TKIDs for observing CMB through atmospheric windows for observations in the 90/150 GHz bands. Assuming lossless dielectric, the coupling efficiency of a single pixel is around 90%. This pixel design will be utilized for future large-scale TKIDs array designs for CMB observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present observational evidence of late-time interaction between the ejecta of the hydrogen-poor Type Ib supernova (SN) 2019yvr and hydrogen-rich circumstellar material (CSM), similar to the Type Ib SN 2014C. A narrow H{\alpha} emission line appears simultaneously with a break in the light-curve decline rate at around 80-100 d after explosion. From the interaction delay and the ejecta velocity, under the assumption that the CSM is detached from the progenitor, we estimate the CSM inner radius to be located at ~6.5-9.1 {\times} 10^{15} cm. The H{\alpha} emission line persists throughout the nebular phase at least up to +420 d post-explosion, with a full width at half maximum of ~2000 km/s. Assuming a steady mass-loss, the estimated mass-loss rate from the luminosity of the H{\alpha} line is ~3-7 {\times} 10^{-5} M_\odot yr^{-1}. From hydrodynamical modelling and analysis of the nebular spectra, we find a progenitor He-core mass of 3-4 M{_\odot}, which would imply an initial mass of 13-15 M{_\odot}. Our result supports the case of a relatively low-mass progenitor possibly in a binary system as opposed to a higher mass single star undergoing a luminous blue variable phase.
