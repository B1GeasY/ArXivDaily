 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive re-calibration of medium- and broad-band photometry from the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) by leveraging two approaches: an improved Gaia XP Synthetic Photometry (XPSP) method with corrected Gaia XP spectra, the Stellar Color Regression (SCR) method with corrected Gaia EDR3 photometric data and spectroscopic data from LAMOST DR7. Through the use of millions of stars as standards per band, we demonstrate the existence of position-dependent systematic errors, up to 23 mmag for the Main Survey region, in the S-PLUS DR4 photometric data. A comparison between the XPSP and SCR methods reveals minor differences in zero-point offsets, typically within the range of 1 to 6 mmag, indicating the accuracy of the re-calibration, and a two- to three-fold improvement in the zero-point precision. During this process, we also verified and corrected for the systematic errors related to CCD position. The corrected S-PLUS DR4 photometric data will provide a solid data foundation for conducting scientific research that relies on high-calibration precision. Our results underscore the power of the XPSP method in combination with the SCR method, showcasing their effectiveness in enhancing calibration precision for wide-field surveys when combined with Gaia photometry and XP spectra, to be applied for other S-PLUS sub-surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Matched-filtering detection techniques for gravitational-wave (GW) signals in ground-based interferometers rely on having well-modeled templates of the GW emission. Such techniques have been traditionally used in searches for compact binary coalescences (CBCs), and have been employed in all known GW detections so far. However, interesting science cases aside from compact mergers do not yet have accurate enough modeling to make matched filtering possible, including core-collapse supernovae and sources where stochasticity may be involved. Therefore the development of techniques to identify sources of these types is of significant interest. In this paper, we present a method of anomaly detection based on deep recurrent autoencoders to enhance the search region to unmodeled transients. We use a semi-supervised strategy that we name Gravitational Wave Anomalous Knowledge (GWAK). While the semi-supervised nature of the problem comes with a cost in terms of accuracy as compared to supervised techniques, there is a qualitative advantage in generalizing experimental sensitivity beyond pre-computed signal templates. We construct a low-dimensional embedded space using the GWAK method, capturing the physical signatures of distinct signals on each axis of the space. By introducing signal priors that capture some of the salient features of GW signals, we allow for the recovery of sensitivity even when an unmodeled anomaly is encountered. We show that regions of the GWAK space can identify CBCs, detector glitches and also a variety of unmodeled astrophysical sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Near-Earth supernova blasts which engulf the solar system have left traces of their ejecta in the geological and lunar records. There is now a wealth of data on live radioactive ${}^{60}$Fe pointing to a supernova at 3 Myr ago, as well as the recent discovery of an event at 7 Myr ago. We use the available measurements to evaluate the distances to these events. For the better analyzed supernova at 3 Myr, samples include deep-sea sediments, ferromanganese crusts, and lunar regolith; we explore the consistency among and across these measurements, which depends sensitively on the uptake of iron in the samples as well as possible anisotropies in the ${}^{60}$Fe fallout. There is also significant uncertainty in the astronomical parameters needed for these calculations. We take the opportunity to perform a parameter study on the effects that the ejected ${}^{60}$Fe mass from a core-collapse supernova and the fraction of dust that survives the remnant have on the resulting distance. We find that with an ejected ${}^{60}$Fe mass of $3\times10^{-5} M_\odot$ and a dust fraction of 10%, the distance range for the supernova 3 Myr ago is $D \sim 20 - 140$ pc, with the most likely range between $50 - 65$ pc. Using the same astrophysical parameters, the distance for the supernova at 7 Myr ago is $D \sim 110$ pc. We close with a brief discussion of geological and astronomical measurements that can improve these results.
#### Cosmic voids and the kinetic analysis. III. Hubble tension and structure  formation in the late Universe

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11734
 - **Abstract**
 We study structure formation in the late Universe within the Vlasov kinetic self-consistent field approach. Our work is principally focused on the use of the modified gravitational potential with a repulsive term of the cosmological constant, which is directly linked to observations that enable characterizations of the Hubble tension as the result of local and global flows. We formulate the criteria for the formation of the semi-periodic gravitating structures, along with the predictions of their quantitative scales associated with observable parameters. Our principal conclusion is that filament formation in the Local (late) Universe can proceed as a deterministic process that is distinct from the structures at larger scales that result from the essentially stochastic dynamics of density perturbations.
#### Stellar model calibrations with the Ai Phe binary system. Open questions  about the robustness of the fit

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11837
 - **Abstract**
 We explore the robustness of the calibration of stellar models achievable with Ai Phe binary system. By means of the SCEPtER pipeline, we investigated the impact of different assumptions about the surface efficiency of microscopic diffusion. In the reference scenario, we allowed modification of the surface metallicity due to microscopic diffusion, while in the alternative scenario we assumed that competing mixing from other sources cancels out this effect. Due to the fact that the primary star has already experienced the first dredge-up while the secondary has not, the tested scenarios show interesting differences. While the estimated age is quite robust ($4.70^{+0.13}_{-0.14}$ Gyr and $4.62^{+0.13}_{-0.06}$ Gyr), the calibration of the convective core overshooting parameter $\beta$ reveals noticeable differences. The reference scenario suggests a wide multi-modal range of possible values of $\beta$ around 0.10; the alternative scenario computations point towards a sharp and lower $\beta$, around 0.04. The impossibility to obtain an unambiguous fit confirms the difficulty in achieving a sensible calibration of the free parameters of stellar models using binary systems, even when very accurate masses and radii are available.
#### Beyond the Drake Equation: A Time-Dependent Inventory of Habitable  Planets and Life-Bearing Worlds in the Solar Neighborhood

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11927
 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a mathematical framework for statistical exoplanet population and astrobiology studies that may help directing future observational efforts and experiments. The approach is based on a set of differential equations and provides a time-dependent mapping between star formation, metal enrichment, and the occurrence of exoplanets and potentially life-harboring worlds over the chemo-population history of the solar neighborhood. Our results are summarized as follows: 1) the formation of exoplanets in the solar vicinity was episodic, starting with the emergence of the thick disk about 11 Gyr ago; 2) within 100 pc from the Sun, there are as many as 11,000 (eta/0.24) Earth-size planets in the habitable zone ("temperate terrestrial planets" or TTPs) of K-type stars. The solar system is younger than the median TTP, and was created in a star formation surge that peaked 5.5 Gyr ago and was triggered by an external agent; 3) the metallicity modulation of the giant planet occurrence rate results in a later typical formation time, with TTPs outnumbering giant planets at early times; 4) the closest, life-harboring Earth-like planet would be < 20 pc away if microbial life arose as soon as it did on Earth in > 1 % of the TTPs around K stars. If simple life is abundant (fast abiogenesis), it is also old, as it would have emerged more than 8 Gyr ago in about one third of all life-bearing planets today. Older Earth analogs are more likely to have developed sufficiently complex life capable of altering the environment and producing detectable oxygenic biosignatures.
#### The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE): Prospects for  Spatially-Resolved X-ray Polarimetry of Extended Sources and In-Orbit  Calibrations

 - **Abstract**
 This thesis focuses on X-ray polarimetry and its recent resurgence due to the NASA/ASI Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) mission launched in December 2021. It aims to address two critical tasks: in-orbit calibrations and observing faint extended celestial sources. For in-orbit calibrations, IXPE carries polarized and unpolarized calibration sources because known celestial sources, like the Crab Nebula, aren't suitable due to variability. Tests were performed on Flight Models of these calibration sources, ensuring their functionality in thermal vacuum when combined with IXPE detectors. Concerning observing faint extended sources, instrumental and diffuse backgrounds pose challenges. The impact of various background sources, such as instrumental, diffuse Galactic plane emission, and cosmic X-ray background, on X-ray polarimetry of faint, extended sources was examined. The feasibility study also covered observing two extended sources: the Tycho supernova remnant and the molecular clouds of the Sgr A complex. Monte Carlo simulations were employed to evaluate the detectability of polarization. Results show that the on-board calibration system will assess and verify the GPD's functionality in orbit. Background mitigation techniques will be required for faintest extended sources. For sources like Cas A, Tycho, and PSW MSH 15-52, background effects are negligible. In conclusion, the IXPE mission opens up spatially resolved X-ray polarimetry, enabling the determination of polarization angles and degrees. Preliminary data after launch indicates that on-board calibration sources are performing as expected, and imaging capabilities meet requirements. This research is essential for advancing X-ray polarimetry and understanding high-energy celestial sources.
#### Collisional excitation of methyl (iso)cyanide by He atoms: rate  coefficients and isomerism effects

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12045
 - **Abstract**
 Among all closed-shell species observed in molecular clouds, molecules with C$_{3v}$ symmetry play a crucial role, as their rotational spectroscopy allows them to behave as a gas thermometer. In the interstellar medium, methyl cyanide (CH$_3$CN) is the second most abundant of those (after ammonia, NH$_3$). Its isomer, methyl isocyanide (CH$_3$NC) is less abundant but has been detected in many astrophysical sources. In order to assess their absolute and relative abundances, it is essential to understand their collisional excitation properties. This paper reports the calculation of rate coefficients for rotational excitation of CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$NC molecules with He atoms, from low (5 K) to moderate (100 K) temperatures. We include the first 74 and 66 rotational states of both $para$ and $ortho$ symmetries of CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$NC, respectively. A propensity for $\Delta j=2$ transitions is observed in the case of CH$_3$CN-He collisions, whereas in the case of CH$_3$NC-He a propensity for $\Delta j=1$ is observed for transitions involving low values of $j$ and at low temperatures, while a propensity for $\Delta j=2$ is observed for higher values of $j$ and at high temperatures. A comparison of rate coefficients shows differences up to a factor of 3, depending on temperature and on the $ortho$/$para$ symmetries for dominant transitions. This confirms the importance of having specific collisional data for each isomer. We also examined the effect of these new rates on the CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$NC excitation in molecular clouds by performing radiative transfer calculations of the excitation and brightness temperatures for several detected lines.
#### A dragon out of breath? Monitoring high-velocity outflows from the  high-mass gamma-ray binary LS 2883/PSR B1259-63 during the 2017--2021 binary  cycle

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of the high-mass gamma-ray binary LS 2883/PSR B1259--63 with the Chandra X-ray Observatory during the 2011--2014 and 2014--2017 binary cycles have shown X-ray emitting clumps, presumably ejected from the binary during periastron passages. These clumps traveled at projected velocities of $\sim0.1 c$ and have shown evidence of being accelerated. The clumps also evolved in shape, size, and flux. We monitored this binary with Chandra during the 2017--2021 binary cycle to search for additional X-ray emitting ejections. While we find evidence of extended emission in two of the six observations, it is unlike the clumps observed in the previous three binary cycles. More specifically, the extended emission is not well localized and no bright clump is observed moving away from the binary. It is still unclear what caused the lack of X-ray emitting clump in this orbital cycle, but it may be due to changes in the decretion disk of the Be star.
#### A multi-zone view on the multi-wavelength emission of blazars
 - **Authors:** Ruo-Yu Liu, Rui Xue, Ze-Rui Wang, Hong-Bin Tan, Markus Böttcher

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12171
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12171
 - **Abstract**
 In this work, a time-dependent modeling is developed to study the emission properties of blazars in the low state. Motivated by various observations, we speculate and assume that numerous discrete radiation zones throughout the jet of a blazar contribute to the broadband emission. We model the temporal evolution of the electron spectrum in each emission zone taking into account the injection, cooling and escape of relativistic electrons. By doing so, we are able to calculate the multi-wavelength emission of each radiation zone. The observed emission of a blazar is then the superposition of the emission from all discrete radiation zones. We revisit the multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions, light curves and polarisation under the model, and discuss its potential to reproduce the flat radio spectra, the core-shift phenomena, the minute-scale gamma-ray variability, and the large polarisation-angle swings, which are difficult to explain under the conventional one-zone models simultaneously.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent cosmological tensions, in particular, to infer the local value of the Hubble constant $H_0$, have developed new independent techniques to constrain cosmological parameters in several cosmologies. Moreover, even when the concordance Cosmological Constant Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model has been well constrained with local observables, its physics has shown deviations from a flat background. Therefore, to explore a possible deviation from a flat $\Lambda$CDM model that could explain the $H_0$ value in tension with other techniques, in this paper we study new cosmological constraints in spatial curvature dark energy models. Additionally, to standard current Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa) catalogs, we extend the empirical distance ladder method through an SNIa sample using the capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to forecast SNIa up to $z \sim 6$, with information on the star formation rates at high redshift. Furthermore, we found that our constraints provide an improvement in the statistics associated with $\Omega_{m}$ when combining SNIa Pantheon and SNIa Pantheon+ catalogs with JW forecasting data.
