 - **Abstract**
 Scientists have long speculated about the potential habitability of Venus, not at the 700K surface, but in the cloud layers located at 48-60 km altitudes, where temperatures match those found on Earth's surface. However, the prevailing belief has been that Venus' clouds cannot support life due to the cloud chemical composition of concentrated sulfuric acid-a highly aggressive solvent. In this work, we study 20 biogenic amino acids at the range of Venus' cloud sulfuric acid concentrations (81% and 98% w/w, the rest water) and temperatures. We find 19 of the biogenic amino acids we tested are either unreactive (13 in 98% w/w and 12 in 81% w/w) or chemically modified in the side chain only, after four weeks. Our major finding, therefore, is that the amino acid backbone remains intact in concentrated sulfuric acid. These findings significantly broaden the range of biologically relevant molecules that could be components of a biochemistry based on a concentrated sulfuric acid solvent.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the Hubble Space Telescope observations of the atmosphere of WASP-121 b, a ultra-hot Jupiter. After reducing the transit, eclipse, and phase-curve observations with a uniform methodology and addressing the biases from instrument systematics, sophisticated atmospheric retrievals are used to extract robust constraints on the thermal structure, chemistry, and cloud properties of the atmosphere. Our analysis shows that the observations are consistent with a strong thermal inversion beginning at ~0.1 bar on the dayside, solar to subsolar metallicity Z (i.e., -0.77 < log(Z) < 0.05), and super-solar C/O ratio (i.e., 0.59 < C/O < 0.87). More importantly, utilizing the high signal-to-noise ratio and repeated observations of the planet, we identify the following unambiguous time-varying signals in the data: i) a shift of the putative hotspot offset between the two phase-curves and ii) varying spectral signatures in the transits and eclipses. By simulating the global dynamics of WASP-121 b atmosphere at high-resolution, we show that the identified signals are consistent with quasi-periodic weather patterns, hence atmospheric variability, with signatures at the level probed by the observations (~5% to ~10%) that change on a timescale of ~5 planet days; in the simulations, the weather patterns arise from the formation and movement of storms and fronts, causing hot (as well as cold) patches of atmosphere to deform, separate, and mix in time.
#### Multiscale Dynamical Scenario of High-mass Star Formation in an IRDC  Filament G34

 - **Abstract**
 There is growing evidence that high-mass star formation (HMSF) is a multiscale, dynamical process in molecular clouds, where filaments transport gas material between larger and smaller scales. We analyze here multiscale gas dynamics in an HMSF filamentary cloud, G034.43+00.24 (G34), using APEX observations of the C18O (2-1), HCO+/H13CO+ (3-2), and HCN/H13CN (3-2) lines. We find large-scale, filament-aligned velocity gradients from C18O emission, which drive filamentary gas inflows onto dense clumps in the middle ridge of G34. The nature of these inflows is gravity driven. We also find clump-scale gas infall in the middle ridge of the MM2, MM4, and MM5 clumps from other lines. Their gas infall rates could depend on large-scale filamentary gas inflows since the infall/inflow rates on these two scales are comparable. We confirm that the multiscale, dynamical HMSF scenario is at work in G34. It could be driven by gravity up to the filament scale, beyond which turbulence originating from several sources, including gravity, could be in effect in G34.
#### Explaining supernova remnant G352.7-0.1 as a peculiar type Ia supernova  inside a planetary nebula

 - **Subjects:** High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01707
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01707
 - **Abstract**
 I identify a point-symmetric morphology of the supernova remnant (SNR) G352.7-0.1 and propose that the outer axially-symmetric structure is the remnant of a common envelope evolution (CEE) of the progenitor system, while the inner structure is the ejecta of a thermonuclear explosion triggered by the merger of a white dwarf (WD) and the core of an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. The main radio structure of SNR G352.7-0.1 forms an outer (large) ellipse. The bright X-ray emitting gas forms a smaller ellipse with a symmetry axis inclined to the symmetry axis of the large radio ellipse. The high abundance of iron and the energy of its X-ray lines suggest a type Ia supernova (SN Ia). The massive swept-up gas suggests a relatively massive progenitor system. I propose a scenario with progenitors of initial masses of M1=5-7Mo and M2=4-5 Mo. At a later phase, the WD remnant of the primary star and the AGB secondary star experience a CEE that ejects the circumstellar material that swept up more ISM to form the large elliptical radio structure. An explosion during the merger of the WD with the core of the AGB star triggered a super-Chandrasekhar thermonuclear explosion that formed the inner structure that is bright in X-ray. A tertiary star in the system caused the misalignment of the two symmetry axes. This study adds to the rich variety of evolutionary routes within the different scenarios of normal and peculiar SNe Ia.
#### Tracing the layers of Photodissociated gas in Trifid Nebula

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01837
 - **Abstract**
 Photodissociated gas bears the signature of the dynamical evolution of the ambient interstellar medium impacted by the mechanical and radiative feedback from an expanding HII region. Here we present an analysis of the kinematics of the young Trifid nebula, based on velocity-resolved observations of the far-infrared fine-structure lines of [C II] at 158 micron and [O I] at 63 micron. The distribution of the photodissociated regions (PDRs) surrounding the nebula is consistent with a shell-like structure created by the HII region expanding with a velocity of 5 km/s. Comparison of ratios of [C II] and [O I] 63 micron intensities for identical velocity components with PDR models indicate a density of 1e4 /cm^3. The red- and blue-shifted PDR shells with a combined mass of 516 Msun have a kinetic energy of ~1e47 erg. This is consistent with the thermal energy of the HII region as well as with the energy deposited by the stellar wind luminosity from HD 169442A, an O7 V star, over the 0.5 Myr lifetime of the star. The observed momentum of the PDR shell is lower than what theoretical calculations predict for the radial momentum due to the shell being swept up by an expanding HII region, which suggests that significant mass loss has occurred in M20 due to the dispersal of the surrounding gas by the advancing ionization front.

 - **Abstract**
 WISE J224607.6-052634.9 (W2246-0526) is a hot dust-obscured galaxy at $z$ = 4.601, and the most luminous obscured quasar known to date. W2246-0526 harbors a heavily obscured supermassive black hole that is most likely accreting above the Eddington limit. We present observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in seven bands, including band 10, of the brightest far-infrared (FIR) fine-structure emission lines of this galaxy: [OI]$_{63\mu m}$, [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$, [NII]$_{122\mu m}$, [OI]$_{145\mu m}$, [CII]$_{158\mu m}$, [NII]$_{205\mu m}$, [CI]$_{370\mu m}$, and [CI]$_{609\mu m}$. A comparison of the data to a large grid of Cloudy radiative transfer models reveals that a high hydrogen density ($n_{H}\sim3\times10^3$ cm$^{-3}$) and extinction ($A_{V}\sim300$ mag), together with extreme ionization ($log(U)=-0.5$) and a high X-ray to UV ratio ($\alpha_{ox}\geq-0.8$) are required to reproduce the observed nuclear line ratios. The values of $\alpha_{ox}$ and $U$ are among the largest found in the literature and imply the existence of an X-ray-dominated region (XDR). In fact, this component explains the a priori very surprising non-detection of the [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$ emission line, which is actually suppressed, instead of boosted, in XDR environments. Interestingly, the best-fitted model implies higher X-ray emission and lower CO content than what is detected observationally, suggesting the presence of a molecular gas component that should be further obscuring the X-ray emission over larger spatial scales than the central region that is being modeled. These results highlight the need for multiline infrared observations to characterize the multiphase gas in high redshift quasars and, in particular, W2246-0526 serves as an extreme benchmark for comparisons of interstellar medium conditions with other quasar populations at cosmic noon and beyond.
