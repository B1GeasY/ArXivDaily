 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a sensitive search for high-velocity gas in interstellar absorption lines associated with the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant (SNR). We examine high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio optical spectra of six stars in the Cygnus Loop region with distances greater than ~700 pc. All stars show low-velocity Na I and Ca II absorption. However, only one star, HD 198301, exhibits high-velocity Ca II absorption components, at velocities of +62, +82, and +96 km/s. The distance to this star of ~870 pc helps to constrain the distance to the receding edge of the Cygnus Loop's expanding shock front. One of our targets, HD 335334, was previously thought to exhibit high positive and high negative velocity interstellar Na I and Ca II absorption. This was one factor leading Fesen et al. to derive a distance to the Cygnus Loop of 725 pc. However, we find that HD 335334 is in fact a double-line spectroscopic binary and shows no evidence of high-velocity interstellar absorption. As such, the distance to HD 335334 cannot be used to constrain the distance to the Cygnus Loop. Our detection of Ca II absorption approaching 100 km/s toward HD 198301 is the first conclusive detection of high-velocity absorption from a low ionization species associated with the Cygnus Loop SNR. A large jump in the Na I column density toward BD+31 4218, a star located beyond the northwestern boundary of the Cygnus Loop, helps to constrain the distance to a large molecular cloud complex with which the Cygnus Loop is evidently interacting.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate determination of mass-loss rates from massive stars is important to understanding stellar and galactic evolution and enrichment of the interstellar medium. Large-scale structure and variability in stellar winds have significant effects on mass-loss rates. Time-series observations provide direct quantification of such variability. Observations of this nature are available for some Galactic early supergiant stars but not yet for stars in lower metallicity environments such as the Magellanic Clouds. We utilise ultraviolet spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope ULLYSES program to demonstrate that the presence of structure in stellar winds of supergiant stars at low metallicities may be discerned from single-epoch spectra. We find evidence that, for given stellar luminosities and mean stellar wind optical depths, structure is more prevalent at higher metallicities. We confirm, at Large Magellanic Cloud (0.5 Z_solar), Small Magellanic Cloud (0.2 Z_solar) and lower (0.14 -- 0.1 Z_solar) metallicities, earlier Galactic results that there does not appear to be correlation between the degree of structure in stellar winds of massive stars and stellar effective temperature. Similar lack of correlation is found with regard to terminal velocity of stellar winds. Additional and revised values for radial velocities of stars and terminal velocities of stellar winds are presented. Direct evidence of temporal variability, on timescales of several days, in stellar wind at low metallicity is found. We illustrate that narrow absorption components in wind-formed profiles of Galactic OB stellar spectra remain common in early B supergiant spectra at low metallicities, providing means for better constraining hot, massive star mass-loss rates.
