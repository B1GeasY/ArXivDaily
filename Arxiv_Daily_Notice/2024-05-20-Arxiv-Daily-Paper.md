 - **Abstract**
 Accretion bursts from low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) are known for many decades. In recent years, the first accretion bursts of massive YSOs (MYSOs) were observed. These phases of intense protostellar growth are of particular importance for studying massive star formation. Bursts of MYSOs are accompanied by flares of Class II methanol masers (hereafter masers), caused by an increase in exciting mid-infrared (MIR) emission. The G323.46$-$0.08 (hereafter G323) event extends the small sample of known MYSO bursts. Maser observations of the MYSO G323 show evidence of a flare, which was presumed to be caused by an accretion burst. This should be verified with IR data. We used time-dependent radiative transfer (TDRT) to characterize the heating and cooling timescales for eruptive MYSOs and to infer the main burst parameters. The G323 accretion burst is confirmed. It reached its peak in late 2013/early 2014 with a Ks-band increase of 2.5mag. TDRT indicates that the duration of the thermal afterglow in the far-infrared (FIR) can exceed the burst duration by years. The latter was proved by SOFIA observations, which indicate a flux increase of $(14.2\pm4.6)$% at $70\, \rm \mu m$ and $(8.5\pm6.1)$% at $160\, \mu$m in 2022 (2 years after the burst end). A one-sided light echo emerged that was propagating into the interstellar medium. The G323 burst is probably the most energetic MYSO burst observed so far. Within $8.4 \rm \, yrs$, an energy of $(0.9\pm_{0.8}^{2.5}) \times 10^{47}\,\rm erg$ was released. The short timescale points to the accretion of a compact body, while the burst energy corresponds to an accumulated mass of at least $(7\pm_{6}^{20})\,M_{Jup}$ and possibly even more if the protostar is bloated. In this case, the accretion event might have triggered protostellar pulsations, which give rise to the observed maser periodicity.
#### Title:

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the environment of a cool core cluster Abell 2566 (redshift $z$ = 0.08247) based on the analysis of 20 ks Chandra X-ray data. 2D imaging analysis of the Chandra data from this cluster revealed spiral structures in the morphology of X-ray emission from within the central 109 kpc formed due to gas sloshing. This analysis also witness sharp edges in the surface brightness distribution along the south-east and north-west of the X-ray peaks at 41.6 kpc and 77.4 kpc, respectively. Spectral analysis of 0.5 - 7 keV X-ray photons along these discontinuities exhibited sharp temperature jumps from 2.3 to 3.1 keV and 1.8 to 2.8 keV, respectively, with consistency in the pressure profiles, implying their association with cold fronts due to gas sloshing of the gas. Further confirmation for such an association was provided by the deprojected broken power-law density function fit to the surface brightness distribution along these wedge shaped sectorial regions. This study also witness an offset of 4.6 arcsec (6.8 kpc) between the BCG and the X-ray peak, and interaction of the BCG with a sub-system in the central region, pointing towards the origin of the spiral structure due to a minor merger.
#### Title:
          Passage of a Gamma-Ray Burst Through a Molecular Cloud: Cloud Ionization Structure

 - **Abstract**
 The model is constructed of the propagation of gamma-ray burst radiation through a dense molecular cloud. The main processes of the interaction of the radiation with the interstellar gas are taken into account in the simulations: the ionization of H and He atoms, the ionization of metal ions and the emission of Auger electrons, the photoionization and the photodissociation of H$_2$ molecules, the absorption of ultraviolet radiation via Lyman and Werner band transitions of H$_2$, the thermal sublimation of dust grains. The ionization of metal ions by X-ray radiation determines the gas ionization fraction in the cloud region, where the gas is predominantly neutral. The ionization of inner electron shells of ions is accompanied by the emission of Auger electrons, giving rise to metal ions in a high ionization state. In particular, the column densities of Mg, Si, Fe in the ionization states I$-$IV are much lower than the column densities of these ions in the ionization state V and higher. The photoionization of metal ions by ultraviolet radiation takes place at distances smaller than the dust-destruction radius and only for neutral atoms with an ionization threshold below 13.6 eV. The simulations have confirmed the previously made suggestion that the ionization of He atoms plays an important role in the absorption of radiation in the X-ray wavelength range. For a low metallicity, $\rm [M/H] \leq -1$, the role of He atoms is dominant.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been proposed that the distinct formation and evolution of exoplanets and brown dwarfs may affect the chemical and isotopic content of their atmospheres. Recent work has indeed shown differences in the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotope ratio, provisionally attributed to the top-down formation of brown dwarfs and the core accretion pathway of super-Jupiters. The ESO SupJup Survey aims to disentangle the formation pathways of isolated brown dwarfs and planetary-mass companions using chemical and isotopic tracers. The survey uses high-resolution spectroscopy with the recently upgraded VLT/CRIRES$^+$ spectrograph, covering a total of 49 targets. Here, we present the first results: an atmospheric characterisation of DENIS J0255-4700, an isolated brown dwarf near the L-T transition. We analyse its K-band spectrum using a retrieval framework where the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS is coupled to PyMultiNest. Gaussian Processes are employed to model inter-pixel correlations and we adopt an updated parameterisation of the PT-profile. Abundances of CO, H$_2$O, CH$_4$, and NH$_3$ are retrieved for this fast-rotating L-dwarf. The ExoMol H$_2$O line list provides a significantly better fit than that of HITEMP. A free-chemistry retrieval is strongly favoured over equilibrium chemistry, caused by an under-abundance of CH$_4$. The free-chemistry retrieval constrains a super-solar C/O-ratio of $\sim0.68$ and a solar metallicity. We find tentative evidence ($\sim3\sigma$) for the presence of $^{13}$CO, with a constraint on the isotope ratio of $\mathrm{^{12}C/^{13}C}=184^{+61}_{-40}$ and a lower limit of $\gtrsim97$, suggesting a depletion of $^{13}$C compared to the interstellar medium ($\sim68$). High-resolution, high signal-to-noise K-band spectra provide an excellent means to constrain the chemistry and isotopic content of sub-stellar objects, as is the main objective of the ESO SupJup Survey.
