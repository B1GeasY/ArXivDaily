 - **Abstract**
 We report here on a project that has developed a practical approach to processing all-sky image collections on cloud platforms, using as an exemplar application the creation of three-color Hierarchical Progressive Survey (HiPS) maps of the 2MASS data set with the Montage Image Mosaic Engine on Amazon Web Services. We will emphasize issues that must be considered by scientists wishing to use cloud platforms to perform such parallel processing, so providing a guide for scientists wishing to exploit cloud platforms for similar large-scale processing. A HiPS map is based on the HEALPix sky-tiling scheme. Progressive zooming of a HiPS map reveals an image sampled at ever smaller or larger spatial scales that are defined by the HEALPix standard. Briefly, the approach used by Montage involves creating a base mosaic at the lowest required HEALPix level, usually chosen to match as closely as possible the spatial sampling of the input images, then cutting out the HiPS cells in PNG format from this mosaic. The process is repeated at successive HEALPix levels to create a nested collection of FITS files, from which PNG files are created that are shown in HiPS viewers. Stretching FITS files to produce PNGs is based on an image histogram. For composite regions (up and including the whole sky), the histograms for each tile can be combined to create a composite histogram for the region. Using this single histogram for each of the individual FITS files means all the PNGs are on the same brightness scale and displaying them side by side in a HiPS viewer produces a continuous uniform map across the entire sky.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be probes of the early universe, but currently, only 26% of GRBs observed by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory GRBs have known redshifts ($z$) due to observational limitations. To address this, we estimated the GRB redshift (distance) via a supervised machine learning model that uses optical afterglow observed by Swift and ground-based telescopes. The inferred redshifts are strongly correlated (a Pearson coefficient of 0.93) with the observed redshifts, thus proving the reliability of this method. The inferred and observed redshifts allow us to estimate the number of GRBs occurring at a given redshift (GRB rate) to be 7.6-8 $yr^{-1} Gpc^{-1}$ for $1.9<z<2.3$. Since GRBs come from the collapse of massive stars, we compared this rate with the star formation rate highlighting a discrepancy of a factor of 3 at $z<1$.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the detection of extended $\gamma$-ray emission from lobes in the radio galaxy NGC 6251 using observation data of Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT). The maximum likelihood analysis results show that a radio morphology template provides a better fit than a point-like source description for the observational data at a confidence level of 8.1$\sigma$, and the contribution of lobes accounts for more than 50\% of the total $\gamma$-ray flux. Furthermore, the $\gamma$-ray energy spectra show a significant disparity in shape between the core and lobe regions, with a curved log-parabola shape observed in core region and a power-law form observed in lobes. Neither the core region nor the northwest lobe displays the significant flux variations in the long-term $\gamma$-ray light curves. The broadband spectral energy distributions of both core region and northwest lobe can be will explained with a single-zone leptonic model. The $\gamma$-rays of core region are due to the synchrotron-self-Compton process while the $\gamma$-rays from northwest lobe are interpreted as inverse Compton emission of the cosmic microwave background.
#### A Robust Light-Curve Diagnostic for Electron-Capture Supernovae and  Low-Mass Fe-Core-Collapse Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are the terminal explosions of massive stars. While most massive stars explode as iron-core-collapse supernovae (FeCCSNe), slightly less massive stars explode as electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe), shaping the low-mass end of CCSNe. ECSNe was proposed $\sim 40$ years ago and first-principles simulations also predict their successful explosions. Observational identification and investigation of ECSNe are important for the completion of stellar evolution theory. To date, only one promising candidate has been proposed, SN 2018zd, other than the historical progenitor of the Crab Nebula, SN 1054. We present representative synthetic light curves of low-mass FeCCSNe and ECSNe exploding with energies in circumstellar media (CSM) estimated with theoretically or observationally plausible methods. The plateaus of the ECSNe are shorter, brighter, and bluer than those of the FeCCSNe. To investigate the robustness of their intrinsic differences, we adopted various explosion energies and CSM. Although they may have similar bolometric light-curve plateaus, ECSNe are bluer than FeCCSNe in the absence of strong CSM interaction, illustrating that multicolor observations are essential to identify ECSNe. This provides a robust indicator of ECSNe because the bluer plateaus stem from the low-density envelopes of their super-asymptotic-giant-branch progenitors. Furthermore, we propose a distance-independent method to identify ECSNe: $(g-r)_{t_{\rm PT}/2} < 0.008 \times t_{\rm PT} - 0.4$, i.e., blue $g-r$ at the middle of the plateau $(g-r)_{t_{\rm PT}/2}$, where $t_{\rm PT}$ is the transition epoch from plateau to tail. Using this method, we identified SN 2018zd as an ECSN, which we believe to be the first ECSN identified with modern observing techniques.
#### Detecting dark matter oscillations with gravitational waveforms

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the phase shift in the gravitational wave signal induced by fast oscillations of scalar dark matter surrounding binary systems, which could be probed by the future experiments LISA and DECIGO. This effect depends on the local matter density and the mass of the dark matter particle. We compare it to the phase shift due to a standard dynamical friction term, which should generically be present. We find that the effect associated with the oscillations only dominates over the dynamical friction for dark matter masses below $10^{-21}$ eV, with masses below $10^{-23}$ eV implying cloud sizes that are too large to be realistic. Moreover, for masses of the order of $10^{-21}$ eV, LISA and DECIGO would only detect this effect for dark matter densities greater than that in the solar system by a factor $10^5$ or $10^4$ respectively. We conclude that this signal can be ignored for most dark matter scenarios unless very dense clouds of very light dark matter are created early in the Universe at a redshift $z\sim 10^4$.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent discoveries of transiting giant exoplanets around M-dwarf stars (GEMS), aided by the all-sky coverage of TESS, are starting to stretch theories of planet formation through the core-accretion scenario. Recent upper limits on their occurrence suggest that they decrease with lower stellar masses, with fewer GEMS around lower-mass stars compared to solar-type. In this paper, we discuss existing GEMS both through confirmed planets, as well as protoplanetary disk observations, and a combination of tests to reconcile these with theoretical predictions. We then introduce the \textit{Searching for GEMS} survey, where we utilize multi-dimensional nonparameteric statistics to simulate hypothetical survey scenarios to predict the required sample size of transiting GEMS with mass measurements to robustly compare their bulk-density with canonical hot-Jupiters orbiting FGK stars. Our Monte-Carlo simulations predict that a robust comparison requires about 40 transiting GEMS (compared to the existing sample of $\sim$ 15) with 5-$\sigma$ mass measurements. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of existing occurrence estimates for GEMS, and provide a brief description of our planned systematic search to improve the occurrence rate estimates for GEMS.
#### Nature of the diffuse emission sources in the H I supershell in the  galaxy IC 1613

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the nearby low-metallicity dwarf galaxy IC 1613, focusing on the search for massive stars and related feedback processes, as well as for faint supernova remnants (SNR) in late stages of evolution. We obtained the deepest images of IC 1613 in the narrow-band H{\alpha}, He II and [S II] emission lines and new long-slit spectroscopy observations using several facilities (6-m BTA, 2.5m SAI MSU, and 150RTT telescopes), in combination with the multi-wavelength archival data from MUSE/VLT, VLA, XMM-Newton, and Swift/XRT. Our deep narrow-band photometry identifies several faint shells in the galaxy, and we further investigate their physical characteristics with the new long-slit spectroscopy observations and the archival multi-wavelength data. Based on energy balance calculations and assumptions about their possible nature, we propose that one of the shells is a possible remnant of a supernova explosion. We study five out of eight Wolf-Rayet (WR) star candidates previously published for this galaxy using the He ii emission line mapping, MUSE/VLT archival spectra, and new long-slit spectra. Our analysis discards the considered WR candidates and finds no new ones. We found P Cyg profiles in H{\alpha} line in two stars, which we classify as Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) star candidates. Overall, the galaxy IC 1613 may have a lower rate of WR star formation than previously suggested.
