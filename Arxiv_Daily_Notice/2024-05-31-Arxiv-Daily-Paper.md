 - **Abstract**
 Recent high-precision observations with HST and Gaia enabled new investigations of the internal kinematics of star clusters (SCs) and the dependence of kinematic properties on the stellar mass. These studies raised new questions about the dynamical evolution of self-gravitating stellar systems. We aim to develop a more complete theoretical understanding of how various kinematical properties of stars affect the global dynamical development of their host SCs. We perform N-body simulations of SCs with isotropic, radially anisotropic and tangentially anisotropic initial velocity distributions. We also study the effect of an external Galactic tidal field. We find three main results. First, compared to the conventional, isotropic case, the relaxation processes are accelerated in the tangentially anisotropic models and, in agreement with our previous investigations, slower in the radially anisotropic ones. This leads to, e.g., more rapid mass segregation in the central regions of the tangential models or their earlier core collapse. Second, although all SCs become isotropic in the inner regions after several relaxation times, we observe differences in the anisotropy profile evolution in the outer cluster regions - all tidally filling models gain tangential anisotropy there while the underfilling models become radially anisotropic. Third, we observe different rates of evolution towards energy equipartition (EEP). While all SCs evolve towards EEP in their inner regions (regardless of the filling factor), the outer regions of the tangentially anisotropic and isotropic models are evolving to an "inverted" EEP (i.e., the high-mass stars having higher velocity dispersion than the low-mass ones). The extent (both spatial and temporal) of this inversion can be attributed to the initial velocity anisotropy - it grows with increasing tangential anisotropy and decreases as the radial anisotropy rises.

 - **Abstract**
 Microlensed stars recently discovered by JWST & HST follow closely the winding critical curve of A370 along all sections of the ``Dragon Arc" traversed by the critical curve. These transients are fainter than $m_{AB}>26.5$, corresponding to the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) and microlensed by diffuse cluster stars observed with $\simeq 18M_\odot/pc^2$, or about $\simeq 1$\% of the projected dark matter density. Most microlensed stars appear along the inner edge of the critical curve, following an asymmetric band of width $\simeq 4$kpc that is skewed by $-0.7\pm0.2$kpc. Some skewness is expected as the most magnified images should form along the inner edge of the critical curve with negative parity, but the predicted shift is small $\simeq -0.04$kpc and the band of predicted detections is narrow, $\simeq 1.4$kpc. Adding CDM-like dark halos of $10^{6-8}M_\odot$ broadens the band as desired but favours detections along the outer edge of the critical curve, in the wrong direction, where sub-halos generate local Einstein rings. Instead, the interference inherent to ``Wave Dark Matter" as a Bose-Einstein condensate ($\psi$DM) forms a symmetric band of critical curves that favours negative parity detections. A de Broglie wavelength of $\simeq 10$pc matches well the observed $4$kpc band of microlenses and predicts negative skewness $\simeq -0.6$kpc, similar to the data. The implied corresponding boson mass is $\simeq 10^{-22}$eV, in good agreement with estimates from dwarf galaxy cores when scaled by momentum. Further JWST imaging may reveal the pattern of critical curves by simply ``joining the dots" between microlensed stars, allowing wave corrugations of $\psi$DM to be distinguished from CDM sub-halos

 - **Abstract**
 We report on findings from scintillation analyses using high-cadence observations of nine canonical pulsars with observing baselines ranging from one to three years. We obtain scintillation bandwidth and timescale measurements for all pulsars in our survey and obtain scintillation arc curvature measurements for four pulsars, detecting multiple arcs for two of them. Using updated pulsar distance estimates, we find evidence of previously undocumented scattering screens along the line of sight (LOS) of PSRs J1645$-$0317 and J2022$+$5154, as well as evidence that one of the arcs along the LOS to PSR J2313$+$4253 may reside somewhere within the Orion-Cygnus arm of the Milky Way. By augmenting the results of previous studies, we find general agreement with estimations of scattering delays from pulsar observations and those predicted by the NE2001 electron density model. In a similar manner, we find additional evidence of a correlation between a pulsar's dispersion measure and the overall variability of its scattering delays over time. The plethora of interesting science obtained through these observations demonstrates the capabilities of the Green Bank Observatory's 20m telescope to contribute to pulsar-based studies of the interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Energetic positrons have been observed in the interstellar medium, and high-energy positrons with relativistic energies up to approximately 1 TeV have been detected in Galactic cosmic rays. We conducted a study on the acceleration of particles, specifically positrons, in a nonrelativistic quasiparallel collisionless shock induced by a plasma consisting of protons, electrons, and positrons. The positron-to-proton number density ratio in the plasma is 0.1. We focused on a representative shock with a sonic Mach number of 17.1 and an Alfvénic Mach number of 16.8 in the rest frame of the shock. To investigate the acceleration mechanisms of particles including positrons in the shock, we utilized one-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. It was found that all three species of particles in the shock can be accelerated and exhibit power law spectra. At the shock front, a significant portion of incoming upstream particles are reflected and undergo significant energy increase, and these reflected particles can be efficiently injected into the process of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). Moveover, the reflected positrons can be further accelerated by an electric field parallel to the magnetic field when they move along the magnetic field upstream of the shock. As a result, positrons can be preferentially accelerated to be injected in the DSA process compared to electrons.
#### WISDOM Project -- XXI. Giant molecular clouds in the central region of the barred spiral galaxy NGC 613: a steep size -- linewidth relation

 - **Abstract**
 NGC~613 is a nearby barred spiral galaxy with a nuclear ring. Exploiting high spatial resolution ($\approx20$ pc) Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array $^{12}$CO(2-1) observations, we study the giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in the nuclear ring and its vicinity, identifying $158$ spatially- and spectrally-resolved GMCs. The GMC sizes ($R_{\mathrm{c}}$) are comparable to those of the clouds in the Milky Way (MW) disc, but their gas masses, observed linewidths ($\sigma_{\mathrm{obs,los}}$) and gas mass surface densities are larger. The GMC size -- linewidth relation ($\sigma_{\mathrm{obs,los}}\propto R_{\mathrm{c}}^{0.77}$) is steeper than that of the clouds of the MW disc and centre, and the GMCs are on average only marginally gravitationally bound (with a mean virial parameter $\langle\alpha_{\mathrm{obs,vir}}\rangle\approx1.7$). We discuss the possible origins of the steep size -- linewidth relation and enhanced observed linewidths of the clouds and suggest that a combination of mechanisms such as stellar feedback, gas accretion and cloud-cloud collisions, as well as the gas inflows driven by the large-scale bar, may play a role.

 - **Abstract**
 A 2D dynamic model is utilized to investigate star formation in rotating filamentary molecular clouds (FMCs) amidst magnetic fields. The study reveals that the emergence of field stars is possible under both weak and strong magnetic fields due to the presence of low-density structures. The presence of a strong rotation in a strongly magnetized FMC Plays a crucial role in forming a combination of two binary pairs and two field stars. An intermediate-density structure in the presence of a moderate magnetic field can form a combination of binary stars and field stars, whereas, in very high dense filamentary molecular clouds, a low magnetic field may help to form binary stars or stellar associations. In a rapidly rotating and weakly magnetized highly dense cloud binary stars are formed, whereas, strong rotation and moderate magnetic field help to form stellar associations

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present the data from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) project for the Maddalena giant molecular cloud (GMC). We decompose the 13CO emission datacube of the observed region into hierarchical substructures using a modified Dendrogram algorithm. We investigate the statistical properties of these substructures and examine the role that self-gravity plays on various spatial scales. The statistics of the mass (M), radius (R), velocity dispersion ({\sigma}v), virial parameter ({\alpha}vir), and sonic Mach number of the substructures are presented. The radius and mass distributions and the {\sigma}v-R scaling relationship of the substructures resemble those reported in previous studies that use non-hierarchical algorithms to identify the entities. We find that for the hierarchical substructures {\alpha}vir decreases as the radius or mass of the substructures increases. The majority of the substructures in the quiescent region of Maddalena GMC are not gravitationally bound ({\alpha}vir > 2), while most of the substructures in the star-forming regions are gravitationally bound ({\alpha}vir < 2). Furthermore, we find that self-gravity plays an important role on scales of 0.8-4 pc in the IRAS 06453 star-forming region, while it is not an important factor on scales below 5 pc in the non-star-forming region.
#### SMA 200-400 GHz Survey for Dust Properties in the Icy Class II Disks in the Taurus Molecular Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new SMA survey of 47 Class II sources in the Taurus-Auriga region. Our observations made 12 independent samples of flux densities over the 200-400 GHz frequency range. We tightly constrained the spectral indices of most sources to a narrow range of $2.0\pm0.2$; only a handful of spatially resolved (e.g., diameter $>$250 au) disks present larger spectral indices. The simplest interpretation for this result is that the (sub)millimeter luminosities of all of the observed target sources are dominated by very optically thick (e.g., $\tau\gtrsim$5) dust thermal emission. Some previous works that were based on the optically thin assumption thus might have underestimated optical depths by at least one order of magnitude. Assuming DSHARP dust opacities, this corresponds to underestimates of dust masses by a similar factor. Moreover, some population synthesis models show that to explain the observed, narrowly distributed spectral indices, the disks in our selected sample need to have very similar dust temperatures ($T_{\small{dust}}$). Given a specific assumption of median $T_{\small{dust}}$, the maximum grain sizes ($a_{\small{max}}$) can also be constrained, which is a few times smaller than 0.1 mm for $T_{\small{dust}}\sim$100 K and a few mm for $T_{\small{dust}}\sim$24 K. The results may indicate that dust grain growth outside the water snowline is limited by the bouncing/fragmentation barriers. In the Class II disks, the dust mass budget outside of the water snowline may be largely retained instead of being mostly consumed by planet formation. While Class II disks still possess sufficient dust masses to feed planet formation at a later time, it is unknown whether or not dust coagulation and planet formation can be efficient or natural outside of the water snowline.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, it has been demonstrated that massive stars see their infant circumstellar medium shaped into a large, irradiated, gravitationally unstable accretion disc during their early formation phase. Such discs constitute the gas reservoir in which nascent high-mass stars gain substantial fraction of their mass by episodic accretion of dense gaseous circumstellar clumps. We aim to evaluate the effects of stellar motion, caused by the disc non-axisymmetric gravitational field, on the disc evolution and its spatial morphology. In particular, we analyze the disc propensity to gravitational instability and fragmentation, and also disc appearance on synthetic millimeter-band images pertinent to the alma facility. We employed three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of the surroundings of a young massive star in the non-inertial spherical coordinate system, adopting the highest spatial resolution to date and including the indirect star-disc gravitational potential caused by the asymmetries in the circumstellar disc. The resulting disc were postprocessed with the radiation transfer tool RADMC-3D and CASA softwear to obtain disc synthetic images. The redistribution of angular momentum in the system makes the disc smaller and rounder, reduces the number of circumstellar gaseous clumps formed via disc gravitational fragmentation, and prevents the ejection of gaseous clumps from the disc. The synthetic predictive images at millimeter wavelengths of the accretion disc including stellar wobbling are in better agreement with the observations of the surroundings of massive young stellar objects, namely, AFGL 4176 mm1, G17.64+0.16 and G353.273, than our numerical hydrodynamics simulations omitting this physical mechanism. Our work confirms that stellar wobbling is an essential ingredient to account for in numerical simulations of accretion discs of massive protostars.

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) We have mapped the prestellar core H-MM1 in Ophiuchus in rotational lines of ortho-H2D+ (oH2D+), N2H+, and DCO+ at the wavelength 0.8 mm with the Large APEX sub-Millimeter Array (LAsMA) multibeam receiver of the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) telescope. We also ran a series of chemistry models to predict the abundance distributions of the observed molecules, and to estimate the effect of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate on their abundances. The three line maps show different distributions. The oH2D+ map is extended and outlines the general structure of the core, while N2H+ mainly shows the density maxima, and the DCO+ emission peaks are shifted towards one edge of the core where a region of enhanced desorption has been found previously. According to the chemical simulation, the fractional oH2D+ abundance remains relatively high in the centre of the core, and its column density correlates strongly with the cosmic-ray ionisation rate. Simulated line maps constrain the cosmic-ray ionisation rate per hydrogen molecule to be low, between 5e-18/s and 1e-17/s in the H-MM1 core. This estimate agrees with the gas temperature measured in the core. Modelling line emission of oH2D+ provides a straightforward method of determining the cosmic-ray ionisation rate in dense clouds, where the primary ion, H3+, is not observable.
#### Mass Cycle and Dynamics of a Virtual Quiescent Prominence

 - **Abstract**
 The mass cycle of solar prominences or filaments is still not completely understood. Researchers agree that these dense structures form by coronal in-situ condensations and plasma siphoning from the underlying chromosphere. In the evaporation-condensation model siphoning arises due to evaporation of chromospheric plasma from localised footpoint heating but this is challenging to justify observationally. Here, we simulate the reconnection-condensation model at extreme-resolutions down to 20.8 km within a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic coronal volume. We form a draining, quiescent prominence and associated coronal rain simultaneously. We show that thermal instability --acting as a trigger for local condensation formation-- by itself drives siphoning flows from the low-corona without the need of any localised heating. In addition, for the first time we demonstrate through a statistical analysis along more than 1000 magnetic field lines that cold condensations give rise to siphoning flows within magnetic threads. This siphoning arises from the strong pressure gradient along field lines induced by thermal instability. No correlation is found between siphoning flows and the prominence mass, making thermal instability the main in-situ mass collection mechanism. Our simulated prominence drains by gliding along strongly sheared, asymmetric, dipped magnetic arcades, and develops natural vertical fine-structure in an otherwise horizontal magnetic field due to the magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability. By synthesising our data, our model shows remarkable agreement with observations of quiescent prominences such as its dark coronal cavity in extreme-ultraviolet emission channels, fine-scale vertical structure and reconnection outflows which, for the first time, have been self-consistently obtained as the prominence evolves.

 - **Abstract**
 Studies of the magnetic characteristics of massive stars have recently received significant attention because they are progenitors of highly magnetised compact objects. Stars initially more massive than about 8M_sun leave behind neutron stars and black holes by the end of their evolution. The merging of binary compact remnant systems produces astrophysical transients detectable by gravitational wave observatories. Studies of magnetic fields in massive stars with low metallicities are of particular interest because they provide important information on the role of magnetic fields in the star formation of the early Universe. While several detections of massive Galactic magnetic stars have been reported in the last few decades, the impact of a low-metallicity environment on the occurrence and strength of stellar magnetic fields has not yet been explored. Because of the similarity between Of?p stars in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) and Galactic magnetic Of?p stars, which possess globally organised magnetic fields, we searched for magnetic fields in Of?p stars in the MCs. Additionally, we observed the massive contact binary Cl* NGC 346 SSN7 in the Small Magellanic Cloud to test the theoretical scenario that the origin of magnetic fields involves a merger event or a common envelope evolution. We obtained and analysed measurements of the magnetic field in four massive Of?p stars in the MCs and the binary Cl* NGC 346 SSN7 using the ESO/VLT FORS2 spectrograph in spectropolarimetric mode. We detected kilogauss-scale magnetic fields in two Of?p-type stars and in the contact binary Cl* NGC 346 SSN7. These results suggest that the impact of low metallicity on the occurrence and strength of magnetic fields in massive stars is low. However, because the explored stellar sample is very small, additional observations of massive stars in the MCs are necessary.
#### Unveiling complex magnetic field configurations in red giant stars

 - **Abstract**
 Recent measurements of magnetic field strength inside the radiative interior of red giant stars open the way towards the characterization of the geometry of stable large-scale magnetic fields. However, current measurements do not properly constrain the topology of magnetic fields due to degeneracies on the observed magnetic field signature on such $\ell=1$ mode frequencies. Efforts focused towards unambiguous detections of magnetic field configurations are now key to better understand angular momentum transport in stars. We investigate the detectability of complex magnetic field topologies inside the radiative interior of red giants. We focus on a field composed of a combination of a dipole and a quadrupole (quadrudipole), and on an offset field. We explore the potential of probing such magnetic field topologies from a combined measurement of magnetic signatures on $\ell=1$ and quadrupolar ($\ell=2$) mixed mode oscillation frequencies. We first derive the asymptotic theoretical formalism for computing the asymmetric signature in frequency pattern for $\ell=2$ modes due to a quadrudipole magnetic field. The degeneracy of the quadrudipole with a dipole is lifted when considering both $\ell=1$ and $\ell=2$ mode frequencies. In addition to the analytical derivation for the quadrudipole, we present the prospect for complex magnetic field inversions using magnetic sensitivity kernels from standard perturbation analysis for forward modeling. Using this method, we demonstrate that offset fields may be mistaken for weak and centered magnetic fields, resulting in underestimating magnetic field strength in stellar cores. We emphasize the need to characterize $\ell=2$ mixed-mode frequencies, (along with the currently characterized $\ell=1$ mixed modes), to unveil the higher-order components of the geometry of buried magnetic fields, and better constrain angular momentum transport inside stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The Solar System Notification Alert Processing System (SNAPS) is a ZTF and Rubin Observatory alert broker that will send alerts to the community regarding interesting events in the Solar System. SNAPS is actively monitoring Solar System objects and one of its functions is to compare objects (primarily main belt asteroids) to one another to find those that are outliers relative to the population. In this paper, we use the SNAPShot1 dataset which contains 31,693 objects from ZTF and derive outlier scores for each of these objects. SNAPS employs an unsupervised approach; consequently, to derive outlier rankings for each object, we propose four different outlier metrics such that we can explore variants of outlier scores and add confidence to outlier rankings. We also provide outlier scores for each object in each permutation of 15 feature spaces, between 2 and 15 features, which yields 32,752 total feature spaces. We show that we can derive population outlier rankings each month at Rubin Observatory scale using four Nvidia A100 GPUs, and present several avenues of scientific investigation that can be explored using population outlier detection.
