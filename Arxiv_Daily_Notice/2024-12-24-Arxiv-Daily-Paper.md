 - **Abstract**
 Constraining the physical and chemical evolution of molecular clouds is essential to our understanding of star formation. These investigations often necessitate knowledge of some local representative number density of the gas along the line of sight. However, constraining the number density is a difficult endeavor. Robust constraints of the number density often require line observations of specific molecules along with radiation transfer modeling, which provides densities traced by that specific molecule. Column density maps of molecular clouds are more readily available, with many high-fidelity maps calculated from dust emission and extinction, in particular from surveys conducted with the Herschel Space Observatory. We introduce a new probabilistic model which is based on the assumption that the total hydrogen nuclei column density along a line of sight can be decomposed into a turbulent component and a gravitationally-dominated component. Therefore, for each pixel in a column density map, the line of sight is decomposed into characteristic diffuse (dubbed ``turbulent'') and dense (dubbed ``gravitational'') gas number densities from column density maps. The method thus exploits a physical model of turbulence to decouple the random turbulent column from gas in dense bound structures empirically using the observed column density maps. We find the model produces reasonable turbulent and gravitational densities in the Taurus L1495/B213 and Polaris Flare clouds. The model can also be used to infer an effective attenuating column density into the cloud, which is useful for astrochemical models of the clouds. We conclude by demonstrating an application of this method by predicting the emission of the [C II], [C I], and CO (J = 1-0) lines across the Taurus L1495/B213 region at the native resolution of the column density map utilizing a grid of photodissociation-region models.

 - **Abstract**
 The R Coronae Borealis (RCB) variables are rare, hydrogen-deficient, carbon-rich supergiants known for large, erratic declines in brightness due to dust formation. Recently, the number of known RCB stars in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds has increased from $\sim$30 to 162. We use all-sky and targeted photometric surveys to create the longest possible light curves for all known RCB stars and systematically study their declines. Our study, the largest of its kind, includes measurements of decline activity levels, morphologies, and periodicities for nearly all RCB stars. We confirm previous predictions that cool RCB stars exhibit more declines than warm RCBs, supporting a relationship between dust formation and condensation temperatures. We also find evidence for two distinct dust production mechanisms. R CrB and SU Tau show decline onsets consistent with a Poisson process, suggesting their dust production is driven by stochastic processes, such as convection. In contrast, RY Sgr's declines correlate with its pulsation period, suggesting that its dust production is driven by pulsationally-induced shocks. Finally, we show that the dust properties of the related class of DY~Per variables differ from those of the RCB stars, suggesting differences in their evolutionary status.
#### Global Thermal Instability in the Spherical Interstellar Clouds

 - **Abstract**
 Thermal instability (TI) is a trigger mechanism, which can explain the formation of small condensations through some regions of the interstellar clouds. The instability criterion for flat geometry approximations has been investigated in previous works. Here, we focus on spherical perturbations in the spherical clouds. Our goal here is to examine the conditions for the occurrence of TI through the thermally dominated (i.e., gravitationally stable) quasi-static spherical interstellar clouds. First, we obtain the profiles of density, temperature, pressure, and enclosed mass of a symmetric spherical cloud. Then, we use the perturbation method to investigate the linear regime of instability and find its growth rate. Considering spherical perturbations on the quasi-static spherical cloud, instead of a thermal and dynamical equilibrium flat cloud, changes the instability criterion so that we can conclude that sphericalness can increase the occurrence of TI. The results show that in the spherical clouds, perturbations with shorter wavelengths have more chance to grow via TI (i.e., greater growth rates).

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new description of the 7.7~$\mu$m region towards the high-mass star-forming region IRAS 23385+6053 taken from open James Webb Space Telescope Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer (JWST MIRI/MRS) data. This area is commonly attributed to the $\nu_4$ deformation mode of methane ice. For the first time gaseous and solid methane were analyzed simultaneously in IRAS 23385+6053. The band at 7.58--7.8 $\mu$m (1320--1280 cm$^{-1}$) is interpreted as a wide solid absorption methane feature overlapped by the sharp features of the methane emission. We report the detection of gaseous methane and estimate its emitting area radius~$R$, temperature~$T$ and column density~$N$ as $R=2940$~au, $T=103^{+13}_{-11}$~K, and $N=0.78_{+6.18}^{-0.64}\times10^{17}$~cm$^{-2}$, correspondingly. The ice content was analyzed with the laboratory spectra dataset of methane in different molecular environments obtained on the Ice Spectroscopy Experimental Aggregate (ISEAge). We were able to describe the wide feature of solid methane with the following laboratory spectra: CH$_4$~:~CO$_2$~=~1~:~5 (at $27.4^{+6.0}_{-10.8}$~K) and CH$_4$~:~H$_2$O~=~1~:~10 (at $8.4^{+16.4}_{-1.7}$~K) deposited at 6.7~K and warmed up at a rate of 0.5 K per minute. The derived column densities are $N_{\text{CH}_4}$(CO$_2$)~=~$2.97^{+0.37}_{-0.57}\times10^{17}$~cm$^{-2}$ and $N_{\text{CH}_4}$(H$_2$O)~=~$1.02^{+0.46}_{-0.27}\times10^{17}$~cm$^{-2}$. According to the best fit solid methane is mostly surrounded by CO$_2$ rather than H$_2$O. The residuals analysis reveals the unassigned region at 1283--1297~cm$^{-1}$ (7.71--7.79~$\mu$m) which is tentatively assigned to nitrous oxide (N$_2$O) in various environments.

 - **Abstract**
 In the era of exoplanet studies with JWST, the transiting, hot gas giant WASP-52 b provides an excellent target for atmospheric characterization through transit spectroscopy. WASP-52 b orbits an active K-type dwarf recognized for its surface heterogeneities, such as star-spots and faculae, which offers challenges to atmospheric characterization via transmission spectroscopy. Previous transit observations have detected active regions on WASP-52 through crossing events in transit light-curves and via the spectral imprint of unocculted magnetic regions on transmission spectra. Here, we present the first JWST observations of WASP-52 b. Our JWST NIRISS/SOSS transit observation, obtained through the GTO 1201 Program, detects two clear spot-crossing events that deform the 0.6-2.8 $\mu$m transit light-curves of WASP-52 b. We find that these two occulted spots combined cover about 2.4 % of the stellar surface and have temperatures about 400-500 K colder than the stellar photosphere. Our NIRISS/SOSS transmission spectrum is best-fit by an atmosphere with H$_2$O (10.8 $\sigma$), He (7.3 $\sigma$, with evidence of an escaping tail at $\sim$ 2.9 $\sigma$), hints of K (2.5 $\sigma$), and unocculted star-spots and faculae (3.6 $\sigma$). The retrieved H$_2$O abundance ($\log$ H$_2$O $\approx -4 \pm 1$) is consistent with a subsolar or solar atmospheric metallicity for two independent data reductions. Our results underscore the importance of simultaneously modelling planetary atmospheres and unocculted stellar heterogeneities when interpreting transmission spectra of planets orbiting active stars and demonstrate the necessity of considering different stellar contamination models that account for both cold and hot active regions.

 - **Abstract**
 With the recent realization that there likely are stably-stratified regions in the interiors of both Jupiter and Saturn, we construct new non-adiabatic, inhomogeneous evolutionary models with the same microphysics for each that result at the present time in respectable fits for all major bulk observables for both planets. These include the effective temperature, radius, atmospheric heavy-element and helium abundances (including helium rain), and the lower-order gravity moments J2 and J4. The models preserve from birth most of an extended "fuzzy" heavy-element core. Our predicted atmospheric helium mass fraction for Saturn is ~0.2, close to some measured estimates, but in disagreement with some published predictions. To preserve a fuzzy core from birth, the interiors of both planets must start out at lower entropies than would be used for traditional "hot start" adiabatic models, though the initial exterior mantle entropies can range from hot to warm start values. We do not see a helium ocean in Saturn's interior, and both models have inner envelopes with significant Brunt-Vaisala frequencies; this region for Saturn at the current epoch is more extended and in it, the Brunt is larger. The total heavy-element mass fraction in Jupiter and in Saturn is determined to be ~14% and ~26%, respectively, though there is some play in these determinations.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. This study aims to investigate the deviation of the intensity ratio of the \ion{Si}{IV} 1394 Å and 1403 Å emission lines from the expected value of 2 in the optically thin regime, as observed in many recent studies. Methods. We analyzed the integrated intensity ratio ($R$) and the wavelength-dependent ratio ($r(\Delta\lambda)$) in a small bifurcated eruption event observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). Results. Despite the relatively complex line profiles, most of the intensity ratio $R$ of \ion{Si}{IV} lines remained greater than 2 in the loops. The ratio $r(\Delta\lambda)$ varied in the line core and wings, changing distinctly from 2.0 to 3.3 along the wavelength. At certain positions, the \ion{Si}{IV} 1394 Å and 1403 Å lines exhibited different Doppler velocities. Conclusions. When diagnosing the spectra of small active region events, not only the impact of opacity but also the influence of resonance scattering should be considered. We propose that the ratio $r(\Delta\lambda)$ can serve as an indicator of the resonance scattering and opacity effect of the \ion{Si}{IV} line.

 - **Abstract**
 Red supergiants (RSGs) are essential to understanding the evolution and the contribution to the interstellar medium of massive stars. However, the number of identified RSGs within the Milky Way is still limited mainly due to the difficulty of measuring stellar extinction and distance. The release of approximately one million RVS spectra in Gaia DR3 presents new opportunity for identifying Galactic RSGs, because the equivalent width of the calcium triplet lines (EW(CaT)) in the spectra is an excellent indicator of stellar surface gravity. This work uses the RVS spectra with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 100 to search for the Galactic RSGs. The dwarf stars and red giants are removed and the RSG candidates are selected by the location in the EW(CaT) vs. BP-RP diagram. The early-type RSG candidates (K0-M2) are then identified by BP-RP > 1.584 and EW(CaT) > 1.1 nm. To identify late-type RSG candidates (after M2), the criteria of the average equivalent widths of TiO in the XP spectra (EW(TiO)) > 10 nm, the color index K-W3 < 0.5 and the period-amplitude sequence from Gaia DR3 LPV catalog are further applied to reduce the contamination of late-type red giants and asymptotic giant branch stars. This method yields 30 early-type (K0-M2) and 6196 late-type (after M2) RSG candidates, which is a significant increase to the present Galactic RSG sample. The application of this approach to the spectra with SNR > 50 results in 48 early-type and 11,491 late-type RSG candidates. This preliminary analysis paves the way for more extensive research with Gaia DR4 when larger spectral datasets are expected to significantly enhance our understanding of Galactic RSG populations.
#### A Search for Radio Millisecond Pulsar Companions around Extremely Low-mass White Dwarfs with Ellipsoidal Variability

 - **Abstract**
 Extremely low-mass white dwarfs (ELM WDs) are helium-core white dwarfs with masses less than 0.3 $M_{\odot}$. Short-period ELM WD binaries that exhibit ellipsoidal variations may harbor heavier companions, either massive white dwarfs or millisecond pulsars (MSPs). In this study, we selected $\sim$ 12,000 ELM WDs or their candidates, and searched for ellipsoidal-like lightcurves with orbital periods shorter than one day, by using the public data from Zwicky Transient Facility. Finally 23 such systems were found, with 17 being newly discovered. We selected nine high-priority targets likely to evolve from the Roche-lobe overflow channel and estimated their companion masses from the extracted ellipsoidal variation amplitude. Among them, the four targets have companion masses exceeding 1 $M_{\odot}$. We performed a search for radio pulsations from six of these targets by using Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. However, no convincing radio pulsed signals were found, resulting in upper limits for the radio flux at around 8 $\mu$Jy. Given the non-detection of radio pulsations from a total of 11 similar systems, the fraction of ellipsoidal ELM WDs around MSPs is estimated to be below 15$^{+6}_{-3}$%. We anticipate that multi-wavelength studies of more ellipsoidal-like ELM WDs will further constrain the fraction.
#### Hydrogenation of acetaldehyde on interstellar ice analogs reveals limited destruction

 - **Abstract**
 We sought to determine which are the main hydrogenation paths of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO). As a partially unsaturated molecule, CH3CHO can have links with more hydrogenated species, like ethanol (C2H5OH) or with more unsaturated ones, like ketene (H2CCO). We used highly accurate quantum chemical calculations to determine the reaction rate constants for the CH3CHO + H/D reaction. Our theoretical results are confronted against our experiments on the hydrogenation and deuteration of CH3CHO ice. We find that acetaldehyde resists hydrogenation, with only a 10\% of conversion to products different than CH3CHO. This is due to a predominance of H-abstraction at the HCO moiety, with reaction rate constants up to four orders of magnitude higher than the next possible reaction channel, that is hydrogenation at the aldehydic carbon. The formed CH3CO radical experiences barrierless or nearly barrierless reactions in all possible reaction positions, reforming CH3CHO and creating a closed loop that protects the molecule against hydrogenation. We constrain the branching ratios for the second reaction from experiments. Our experiments agree with the calculations and from the combination of both we can explain the presence of H2CCO, CO, CH4, C2H5OH, H2CO or CH3OH as minor products at the end of the reaction. We provide recommendations for future modeling efforts. Our results show limited destruction of acetaldehyde, reinforcing the vision of this molecule as an abundant and resilient COM. From the experiments, we are not able to observe the reactive desorption of this molecule. Our results align with other modeling works, showing that the link between CH3CHO and C2H5OH is not direct. Finally, our results can explain the excess of CH3CDO found in prestellar cores.
#### A Tale of Three: Magnetic Fields along the Orion Integral-Shaped Filament as Revealed by JCMT BISTRO survey

 - **Abstract**
 As part of the BISTRO survey, we present JCMT 850 $\mu$m polarimetric observations towards the Orion Integral-Shaped Filament (ISF) that covers three portions known as OMC-1, OMC-2, and OMC-3. The magnetic field threading the ISF seen in the JCMT POL-2 map appears as a tale of three: pinched for OMC-1, twisted for OMC-2, and nearly uniform for OMC-3. A multi-scale analysis shows that the magnetic field structure in OMC-3 is very consistent at all the scales, whereas the field structure in OMC-2 shows no correlation across different scales. In OMC-1, the field retains its mean orientation from large to small scales, but shows some deviations at small scales. Histograms of relative orientations between the magnetic field and filaments reveal a bimodal distribution for OMC-1, a relatively random distribution for OMC-2, and a distribution with a predominant peak at 90$^\circ$ for OMC-3. Furthermore, the magnetic fields in OMC-1 and OMC-3 both appear to be aligned perpendicular to the fibers, which are denser structures within the filament, but the field in OMC-2 is aligned along with the fibers. All these suggest that gravity, turbulence, and magnetic field are each playing a leading role in OMC-1, 2, and 3, respectively. While OMC-2 and 3 have almost the same gas mass, density, and non-thermal velocity dispersion, there are on average younger and fewer young stellar objects in OMC-3, providing evidence that a stronger magnetic field will induce slower and less efficient star formation in molecular clouds.
