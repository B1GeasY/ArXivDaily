 - **Abstract**
 The scaling of galaxy properties with halo mass suggests that feedback loops regulate star formation, but there is no consensus yet about how those feedback loops work. To help clarify discussions of galaxy-scale feedback, Paper I presented a very simple model for supernova feedback that it called the minimalist regulator model. This followup paper interprets that model and discusses its implications. The model itself is an accounting system that tracks all of the mass and energy associated with a halo's circumgalactic baryons--the central galaxy's atmosphere. Algebraic solutions for the equilibrium states of that model reveal that star formation in low-mass halos self-regulates primarily by expanding the atmospheres of those halos, ultimately resulting in stellar masses that are insensitive to the mass-loading properties of galactic winds. What matters most is the proportion of supernova energy that couples with circumgalactic gas. However, supernova feedback alone fails to expand galactic atmospheres in higher-mass halos. According to the minimalist regulator model, an atmospheric contraction crisis ensues, which may be what triggers strong black-hole feedback. The model also predicts that circumgalactic medium properties emerging from cosmological simulations should depend largely on the specific energy of the outflows they produce, and we interpret the qualitative properties of several numerical simulations in light of that prediction.

 - **Abstract**
 Blazars can be detected from very large distances due to their high luminosity. However, the detection of $\gamma$-ray emission of blazars beyond $z=3$ has only been confirmed for a small number of sources. Such observations probe the growth of supermassive black holes close to the peak of star formation in the history of galaxy evolution. As a result from a continuous monitoring of a sample of 80 $z>3$ blazars with Fermi-LAT, we present the first detection of a $\gamma$-ray flare from the $z=4.31$ blazar TXS 1508+572. This source showed high $\gamma$-ray activity from February to August 2022, reaching a peak luminosity comparable to the most luminous flares ever detected with Fermi -LAT. We conducted a multiwavelength observing campaign involving XMM-Newton, Swift, the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope and the Very Long Baseline Array. In addition, we make use of the monitoring programs by the Zwicky Transient Facility and NEOWISE at optical and infrared wavelengths, respectively. We find that the source is particularly variable in the infrared band on daily time scales. The spectral energy distribution collected during our campaign is well described by a one-zone leptonic model, with the $\gamma$-ray flare originating from an increase of external Compton emission as a result of a fresh injection of accelerated electrons.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the structures of open clusters is crucial for understanding stellar evolution and galactic dynamics. Based on Gaia DR3 data, we apply the hierarchical clustering algorithm to a young open cluster NGC 6530 and group its members into 5 substructures. By linear tracing with the kinematic information of their members, we find that: Sub 1 is the core of the cluster. It is expanding slowly. Sub 2 consists of less bound members, which began escaping from the core about 0.78 Myr ago. Sub 3 is associated with a young star forming region. It will merge with the core after 0.72 Myr; Sub 4, as an outskirt group, is also moving towards the core, but won't end up falling in. While Sub 5 is composed of less-bound members with field contamination. This work reveals the complex internal structure and evolutionary trends of the cluster NGC 6530. It also shows the potential of the hierarchical clustering algorithm in star cluster structure analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanets are celestial bodies orbiting stars beyond our Solar System. Although historically they posed detection challenges, Kepler's data has revolutionized our understanding. By analyzing flux values from the Kepler Mission, we investigate the intricate patterns in starlight that may indicate the presence of exoplanets. This study investigates a novel approach for exoplanet classification using Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) applied to data obtained from the NASA Kepler mission. SNNs offer a unique advantage by mimicking the spiking behavior of neurons in the brain, allowing for more nuanced and biologically inspired processing of temporal data. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SNN architecture, excelling in various performance metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies suggest that filamentary structures are representative of the initial conditions of star formation in molecular clouds and support a filament paradigm for star formation, potentially accounting for the origin of the stellar initial mass function (IMF). Using Herschel imaging observations of the California giant molecular cloud, we aim to further investigate the filament paradigm for low- to intermediate-mass star formation and to better understand the exact role of filaments in the origin of stellar masses. Using the multiscale, multiwavelength extraction method getsf, we identify starless cores, protostars, and filaments in the Herschel data set and separate these components from the background cloud contribution to determine accurate core and filament properties. Both the prestellar core mass function (CMF) and the distribution of filament masses per unit length or filament line mass function (FLMF) are consistent with power-law distributions at the high-mass end, $\Delta N/\Delta {\rm log}M\propto M^{-1.4 \pm 0.2}$ at $M > 1\,M_\odot$ for the CMF and $\Delta N/\Delta {\rm log} {M}_{\rm line} \propto {M}_{\rm line}^{-1.5\pm0.2}$ for the FLMF at $M_{\rm line} > 10\,M_\odot {\rm pc^{-1}}$, which are both consistent with the Salpeter power-law IMF. Based on these results, we propose a revised model for the origin of the CMF in filaments, whereby the global prestellar CMF in a molecular cloud arises from the integration of the CMFs generated by individual thermally supercritical filaments within the cloud. Our findings support the existence a tight connection between the FLMF and the CMF/IMF and suggests that filamentary structures represent a critical evolutionary step in establishing a Salpeter-like mass function.

 - **Abstract**
 Close encounter between a star and a supermassive black hole (SMBH) results in the tidal disruption of the star, known as a tidal disruption event (TDE). Recently, a few TDEs, e.g., ASASSN-15oi and AT2018hyz, have shown late-time (hundreds of days after their UV/optical peaks) radio flares with radio luminosities of $10^{38\sim39}$ erg/s. The super-Eddington fallback or accretion in a TDE may generate a mass outflow. Here we investigate a scenario that the late-time radio flares come from the interaction of the outflow with the circum-nuclear gaseous clouds, in addition to the slow-evolving emission component due to the outflow-diffuse medium interaction. We calculate the associated radio temporal and spectral signatures and find that they reproduce well the observations. The outflows have the inferred velocity of 0.2$\sim0.8$ c, the total mass of $10^{-3}\sim10^{-1}$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and the ejection duration of a month to a year. The distances of the clouds to the SMBH are $0.1\sim1$ pc. This scenario has advantages in explaining the long delay, sharpness of the rise and the multiplicity of the late radio flares. Future observations may build up a much larger sample of late-time radio flares and enable their use as a probe of the TDE physics and the host circumnuclear environment.
#### A Census of Sun's Ancestors and their Contributions to the Solar System Chemical Composition

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we compute the rates and numbers of different types of stars and phenomena (SNe, novae, white dwarfs, merging neutron stars, black holes) that contributed to the chemical composition of the Solar System. Stars die and restore the newly formed elements into the interstellar gas. This process is called "chemical evolution". In particular, we analyse the death rates of stars of all masses, dying either quiescently or explosively. These rates and total star numbers are computed in the context of a revised version of the two-infall model for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way, which reproduces fairly well the observed abundance patterns of several chemical species, as well as the global solar metallicity. We compute also the total number of stars ever born and still alive as well as the number of stars born up to the formation of the Solar System and with a mass and metallicity like the Sun. This latter number will account for all the possible existing Solar Systems which can host life in the solar vicinity. Among all the stars (from 0.8 to 100 M$_{\odot}$) born and died from the beginning up to the Solar System formation epoch, which contributed to its chemical composition, 93.00$\%$ are represented by stars dying as single white dwarfs (without interacting significantly with a companion star) and originating in the mass range 0.8-8 M$_{\odot}$, while 5.24$\%$ are neutron stars and 0.73$\%$ are black holes, both originating from SNe core-collapse (M>8 M$_{\odot}$); 0.64$\%$ are Type Ia SNe and 0.40$\%$ are nova systems, both originating from the same mass range as the white dwarfs. The number of stars similar to the Sun born from the beginning up to the Solar System formation, with metallicity in the range 12+log(Fe/H)= 7.50 $\pm$ 0.04 dex is 3.1732$\cdot$ 10$^{7}$, and in particular our Sun is the 2.6092$\cdot$ 10$^7$-th star of this kind, born in the solar vicinity.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the evolution of various properties of multiple-population globular clusters (GCs) for a broad range of initial conditions. We simulated over 200 GC models using the MOCCA Monte Carlo code and find that present-day properties (core and half-light radii, ratio of the number of second-generation (SG) stars to the total number of stars, NSG/NTOT) of these models cover the observed values of these quantities for Milky Way GCs. Starting with a relatively small value of the SG fraction (NSG/NTOT ~ 0.25) and a SG system concentrated in the inner regions of the cluster, we find, in agreement with previous studies, that systems in which the first-generation (FG) is initially tidally filling or slightly tidally underfilling best reproduce the observed ratios of NSG/NTOT and have values of the core and half-light radii typical of those of many Galactic globular clusters. Models in which the FG is initially tidally underfilling retain values of NSG/NTOT close to their initial values. These simulations expand previous investigations and serve to further constrain the viable range of initial parameters and better understand their influence on present-day GC properties. The results of this investigation also provide the basis for our future survey aimed at building specific models to reproduce the observed trends (or lack thereof) between the properties of multiple stellar populations and other clusters properties.

 - **Abstract**
 The prevalence of light element enhancement in the most metal-poor stars is potentially an indication that the Milky Way has a metallicity floor for star formation around $\sim$10$^{-3.5}$ Z$_{\odot}$. We propose that this metallicity floor has its origins in metal-enriched star formation in the minihalos present during the Galaxy's initial formation. To arrive at this conclusion, we analyze a cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulation that follows the concurrent evolution of multiple Population III star-forming minihalos. The main driver for the central gas within minihalos is the steady increase in hydrostatic pressure as the halos grow. We incorporate this insight into a hybrid one-zone model that switches between pressure-confined and modified free-fall modes to evolve the gas density with time according to the ratio of the free-fall and sound-crossing timescales. This model is able to accurately reproduce the density and chemo-thermal evolution of the gas in each of the simulated minihalos up to the point of runaway collapse. We then use this model to investigate how the gas responds to the absence of H$_{2}$. Without metals, the central gas becomes increasingly stable against collapse as it grows to the atomic cooling limit. When metals are present in the halo at a level of $\sim$10$^{-3.7}$ Z$_{\odot}$, however, the gas is able to achieve gravitational instability while still in the minihalo regime. Thus, we conclude that the Galaxy's metallicity floor is set by the balance within minihalos of gas-phase metal cooling and the radiation background associated with its early formation environment.
#### Rotational spectroscopy of CH$_3$OD with a reanalysis of CH$_3$OD toward IRAS 16293$-$2422

 - **Abstract**
 We have started a measurement campaign of numerous methanol isotopologs in low-lying torsional states in order to provide extensive line lists for radio astronomical observations from an adequate spectroscopic model and to investigate how the intricate vibration-torsion-rotation interactions manifest themselves in the spectra of different isotopic species. After CD$_3$OH and CD$_3$OD, we turn our focus to CH$_3$OD, which is an important species for studying deuteration in prestellar cores and envelopes that enshroud protostars. Notably, deuteration is frequently viewed as a diagnostic tool for star formation. The measurements used in this study were obtained in two spectroscopic laboratories and cover large fractions of the 34 GHz--1.35 THz range. As done in previous studies, we employed a torsion-rotation Hamiltonian model for our analysis that is based on the rho-axis method. The resulting model describes the ground and first excited torsional states of CH$_3$OD well up to quantum numbers $J \leqslant 51$ and $K_a \leqslant 18$. We derived a line list for radio astronomical observations from this model that is accurate up to at least 1.35~THz and should be sufficient for all types of radio astronomical searches for this methanol isotopolog in these two lowest torsional states. This line list was applied to a reinvestigation of CH$_3$OD in data from the Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey of IRAS 16293--2422 obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The new accurately determined value for the column density of CH$_3$OD implies that the deuteration in methanol differs in its two functional groups by a factor of $\sim$7.5.

 - **Abstract**
 We search for atmospheric constituents for the UHJ WASP-178 b with two ESPRESSO transits using the narrow-band and cross-correlation techniques, focusing on the detections of NaI, H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, MgI, FeI and FeII. Additionally, we show parallel photometry used to obtain updated and precise stellar, planetary and orbital parameters. We report the resolved line detections of NaI (5.5 and 5.4 $\sigma$), H$\alpha$ (13 $\sigma$), H$\beta$ (7.1 $\sigma$), and tentatively MgI (4.6 $\sigma$). In cross-correlation, we confirm the MgI detection (7.8 and 5.8 $\sigma$) and additionally report the detections of FeI (12 and 10 $\sigma$) and FeII (11 and 8.4 $\sigma$), on both nights separately. The detection of MgI remains tentative, however, due to the differing results between both nights, as well as compared with the narrow-band derived properties. None of our resolved spectral lines probing the mid- to upper atmosphere show significant shifts relative to the planetary rest frame, however H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ exhibit line broadenings of 39.6 $\pm$ 2.1 km/s and 27.6 $\pm$ 4.6 km/s, respectively, indicating the onset of possible escape. WASP-178 b differs from similar UHJ with its lack of strong atmospheric dynamics in the upper atmosphere, however the broadening seen for FeI (15.66 $\pm$ 0.58 km/s) and FeII (11.32 $\pm$ 0.52 km/s) could indicate the presence of winds in the mid-atmosphere. Future studies on the impact of the flux variability caused by the host star activity might shed more light on the subject. Previous work indicated the presence of SiO cloud-precursors in the atmosphere of WASP-178 b and a lack of MgI and FeII. However, our results suggest that a scenario where the planetary atmosphere is dominated by MgI and FeII is more likely. In light of our results, we encourage future observations to further elucidate these atmospheric properties.
