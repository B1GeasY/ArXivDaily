 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of young stellar object (YSO) variability within the M17 Southwest Extension (M17 SWex), using 3.5 years of monitoring data from the JCMT Transient Survey at sub-millimeter (sub-mm) and 9 years from the NEOWISE mission at mid-infrared (mid-IR). Our study encompasses observations of 147 bright sub-mm peaks identified within our deep JCMT co-added map as well as 156 YSOs in NEOWISE W1 and 179 in W2 that were previously identified in Spitzer surveys. We find three robust sub-mm variables: two are candidate YSOs and one is a likely extragalactic source. At mid-IR wavelengths, our analysis reveals secular and stochastic variability in 47 YSOs, with the highest fraction of secular variability occurring at the earliest evolutionary stage. This is similar to what has previously been observed for low-mass YSO variability within the Gould Belt. However, we observe less overall variability in M17SWex at both the sub-mm and mid-IR. We suspect that this lower fraction is due to the greater distance to M17 SWex. Our findings showcase the utility of multi-wavelength observations to better capture the complex variability phenomena inherent to star formation processes and demonstrate the importance of years-long monitoring of a diverse selection of star-forming environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decade, progress in observational capabilities, combined with theoretical advancements, have transformed our comprehension of the physics and chemistry during planet formation. Despite these important steps forward, open questions persist on the chemical and physical evolution of solids in their journey from the collapsing molecular cores to disks and planetary bodies. This chapter is a repository of such burning questions. It has the ambition to identify the most promising avenues for future research based on current observational and modeling opportunities.

 - **Abstract**
 The high redshift 21-cm signal promises to be a crucial probe of the state of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Understanding the connection between the observed 21-cm power spectrum and the physical quantities intricately associated with the IGM is crucial to fully understand the evolution of our Universe. In this study, we develop an emulator using artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the 21-cm power spectrum from a given set of IGM properties, namely, the bubble size distribution and the volume averaged ionization fraction. This emulator is implemented within a standard Bayesian framework to constrain the IGM parameters from a given 21-cm power spectrum. We compare the performance of the Bayesian method to an alternate method using ANN to predict the IGM parameters from a given input power spectrum, and find that both methods yield similar levels of accuracy, while the ANN is significantly faster. We also use this ANN method of parameter estimation to predict the IGM parameters from a test set contaminated with noise levels expected from the SKA-LOW instrument after 1000 hours of observation. Finally, we train a separate ANN to predict the source parameters from the IGM parameters directly, at a redshift of $z=9.1$, demonstrating the possibility of a non-analytic inference of the source parameters from the IGM parameters for the first time. We achieve high accuracies, with R2-scores ranging between $0.898-0.978$ for the ANN emulator and between $0.966-0.986$ and $0.817-0.981$ for the predictions of IGM parameters from 21-cm power spectrum and source parameters from IGM parameters, respectively. The predictions of the IGM parameters from the Bayesian method incorporating the ANN emulator leads to tight constraints with error bars around $\pm{0.14}$ on the IGM parameters.
#### Isochrone fitting to the open cluster M67 in the era of Gaia and improved model physics

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia mission has provided highly accurate observations that have significantly reduced the scatter in the colour-magnitude diagrams of open clusters. As a result of the improved isochrone sequence of the open cluster M67, we have created new stellar models that avoid commonly used simplifications in 1D stellar modelling, such as mass-independent core overshooting and a constant mixing length parameter. This has enabled us to deliver a precise isochrone specifically designed for M67, available for download. We follow a commonly used qualitative approach to adjust the input physics to match the well-defined colour-magnitude sequence, and we test the model-predicted masses against a known eclipsing binary system at the main sequence turnoff of the cluster. Despite using improvements in photometry and stellar physics we cannot match the masses of both binary components with the same theoretical isochrone. A chi-square-based isochrone fitting approach using our preferred input physics results in a cluster age of 3.95+0.16-0.15 Gyrs.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as powerful cosmological probes in recent years offering valuable insights into cosmic expansion. These predominantly extragalactic transients encode information on the expansion of the Universe through their dispersion measure, reflecting interactions with the intervening medium along the line of sight. In this study, we introduce a novel method for reconstructing the late-time cosmic expansion rate and estimating the Hubble constant, solely derived from FRBs measurements coupled with their redshift information while employing Artificial Neural Networks. Our approach yields a Hubble constant estimate of $H_0 = 67.3\pm6.6\rm \ km \ s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}$. With a dataset comprising 23 localised data points, we demonstrate a precision of $\sim10\%$. However, our forecasts using simulated datasets indicate that in the future it could be possible to achieve precision comparable to the SH0ES collaboration or the Planck satellite. Our findings underscore the potential of FRBs as alternative, independent tools for probing cosmic dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on a sample of K giant from Large sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) Data Release 8 and a sample of RR Lyrae (RRL) from \textit{Gaia} Data Release 3, we investigate the compositions of the Hercules-Aquila Cloud (HAC) and Virgo Over-density (VOD) and their collective contribution to the tilt and triaxiality of the stellar halo ($r\,\textless\,40\,{\rm kpc}$) as well as two breaks at $\approx15\,{\rm kpc}$ and 30\,kpc. We apply the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to divide the stellar halo into the isotropic component and the radially biased anisotropic component, namely Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), and find that both HAC and VOD are dominated by the GSE debris stars with weights of $0.67^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$ and $0.57^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$, respectively. In addition, using the K giants with orbital parameters, we identify the member stars of known substructures, including GSE, Sagittarius (Sgr), Helmi Streams, Sequoia, Thamnos, Pontus, Wukong, and Metal-weak Thick Disk (MWTD), to probe the compositions of low-eccentricity stars in the HAC and VOD regions. In density fittings of the RRL sample, we note that the absence of HAC and VOD has a weak effect on the shape of halo. Finally, we find that the radially biased anisotropic halo contributes majorly to the stellar halo that can be modelled with a tilted triaxial ellipsoid and a doubly broken power law with breaking radii at $18.08^{+2.04}_{-3.22}\,{\rm kpc}$ and $33.03^{+1.30}_{-1.21}\,{\rm kpc}$. This has important significance for understanding the status of large diffuse over-densities in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulent convection models treat stellar convection more physically than standard mixing-length theory by including non-local effects. We recently successfully applied the Kuhfuss version to convective cores in main sequence stars. Its usefulness for convective envelopes remains to be tested. The solar convective envelope constitutes a viable test bed for investigating the usefulness of the 1-equation Kuhfuss turbulent convection model. We used the one-dimensional stellar evolution code GARSTEC to calculate a standard solar model with the 1-equation Kuhfuss turbulent convection model, and compared it to helioseismic measurements and a solar model using standard mixing-length theory. Additionally, we investigated the influence of the additional free parameters of the convection model on the solar structure. The 1-equation Kuhfuss model reproduces the sound-speed profile and the lower boundary of the convective region less well than the mixing-length model, because the inherent non-local effects overestimate the amount of convective penetration below the Schwarzschild boundary. We trace this back to the coupling of the temperature gradient to the convective flux in the 1-equation version of the Kuhfuss theory. The temperature stratification of the solar convective envelope is not well modelled by the 1-equation Kuhfuss turbulent convection model, and the more complex 3-equation version is needed to improve the modelling of convection in the envelopes of 1D stellar evolution models.

 - **Abstract**
 First, I demonstrate the possible formation channel for neutron stars (NSs) via the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of oxygen-neon-magnesium (ONeMg) composition white dwarfs (WDs) inside planetary nebulae (PNe; also so-called symbiotic nebulae). A heavy mass loss via the stellar wind or during the the roche-lobe overfilling (RLOF) mass-transfer may happen at the late evolutionary phase of ONeMg WD - red giant (or asymptotic giant branch) star binaries, and it might form nebulae with central accreting WD binaries. The nebulae might be ionized the hot cores of giant stars or accreting WDs. Therefore, the accreting WD inside the symbiotic nebulae might grow in mass to the Chandrasekhar limit mass and collapse. Peculiar NSs born via the AIC of WDs inside the symbiotic nebulae (PNe) may finally have WD companions and become the NS-WD systems, and the Milky Way may contain tens of such kind of systems. Second, I introduce another possibility for the formation of PNe (or pulsar wind nebulae) with newborn NS via the core-merger-induced collapse during the common envelope evolution of ONeMg WD binaries.
#### AstroSat/UVIT Study of the Diffuse Ultraviolet Radiation in the Dwarf Galaxy Holmberg II

 - **Abstract**
 We present measurements of diffuse ultraviolet emission in the dwarf irregular galaxy Holmberg II obtained with the UltraViolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat. With a spatial resolution of 1.2 to 1.6 arcsec, these are the highest resolution UV observations of the galaxy to date. We find that diffuse emission accounts for 70.6 % (58.1 %) of the total FUV(NUV) emission, respectively. We perform a UV-IR correlation study of the diffuse emission in this galaxy using infrared observations from Spitzer Space Telescope and Herschel Space Observatory for selected locations, free of detectable bright point sources. The strongest positive correlation between FUV and IR is observed at 70 micron for high HI density locations, indicating that warm dust grains dominate the IR emission, in agreement with earlier studies, while NUV is better correlated with 160 micron emission associated with cold dust grains. Low HI density regions or cavities, do not show any significant UV-IR correlation except at 160 micron, implying either the presence of colder dust grains in cavities, being irradiated by the general radiation field, or insufficient amount of dust. The dust scattering contribution in high HI density regions, estimated using a single scattering model with foreground dust clouds with LMC reddening, gives best-fit albedo and asymmetry factor values of 0.2 and 0.5, respectively, in reasonable agreement with the theoretical predictions for LMC dust. Our model derived scattering optical depths in the FUV range from 0.02 to 0.12, implying the medium is optically thin. Therefore, in high HI density regions, dust scattering can be one the sources of the observed diffuse UV emission, apart from possible contributions from molecular hydrogen fluorescence, However, the diffuse UV component in HI cavities can only be explained via other mechanisms, such as two photon emission.

 - **Abstract**
 We study penetration of interstellar cosmic rays (CRs) into molecular clouds surrounded by nonuniform diffuse envelopes. The present work generalizes our earlier model of CR self-modulation (Ivlev et al. 2018, Dogiel et al. 2018), in which the value for the envelope's gas density where CRs excite MHD waves was treated as a free parameter. Now, we investigate the case where the density monotonically increases toward the center. Assuming that CRs are relativistic, we obtain a universal analytical solution which does not depend on the particular shape of gas distribution in the envelope, and self-consistently derive boundaries of the diffusion zone formed within the envelope, where CRs are scattered at the self-excited waves. The values of the gas density at the boundaries are found to be substantially smaller than those assumed in the earlier model, which leads to a significantly stronger modulation of penetrating CRs. We compute the impact of CR self-modulation on the gamma-ray emission, and show that the results of our theoretical model are in excellent agreement with recent observations of nearby giant molecular clouds by Yang et al. (2023).
#### SDSSJ0018-0939: A Clear Signature of Sub-Chandrasekhar Mass Type 1a Supernova

 - **Abstract**
 Very metal-poor (VMP) stars (${\rm [Fe/H]}\leq -2$) that have sub-solar values of ${\rm [X/Fe]}$ for $\alpha$ elements such as Mg, Si, and Ca, are referred to as $\alpha$-poor VMP stars. They are quite rare among VMP stars and are thought to have formed from gas enriched predominantly by a single Type Ia supernovae (SN 1a) in contrast to most VMP stars which are $\alpha$-enhanced and usually associated with core-collapse supernovae. The observed abundance pattern in such stars can provide a direct way to probe the nucleosynthesis in individual SN 1a. Although the abundance patterns in some $\alpha$-poor VMP stars have been shown to be consistent with SN 1a ejecta, a clear nucleosynthetic signature for SN 1a resulting from the explosion of a near Chandrasekhar mass (near-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) or a sub-Chandrasekhar mass (sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) white dwarf, has not been unambiguously detected. We perform a detailed analysis of various formation channels of VMP stars and find that the $\alpha$-poor VMP star SDSSJ0018-0939, which was earlier reported as a star with potential pair-instability supernova origin, provides almost a smoking-gun signature of a sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a resulting from He detonation. We find that compared to other $\alpha$-poor VMP stars that were previously identified with SN 1a, SDSSJ0018-0939 is the only star that has a clear and unambiguous signature of SN 1a. Interestingly, our results are consistent with constraints on SN 1a from recent galactic chemical evolution studies that indicate that sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a account for $\sim 50\hbox{--}75\,\%$ of all SN 1a are and possibly the dominant channel in the early Galaxy.
#### Properties of observable mixed inertial/gravito-inertial modes in {\gamma} Doradus stars

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04074

 - **Abstract**
 In {\gamma} Doradus ({\gamma} Dor) stars, gravito-inertial modes in the radiative zone and inertial modes in the convective core can interact resonantly, which translates into the appearance of dip structures in the period spacing of modes. Those dips are information-rich as they are related to the star core characteristics. We aim at characterising these dips according to stellar properties and thus developing new seismic diagnostic tools to constrain the internal structure of {\gamma} Dor stars, especially their core. We used the two-dimensional oscillation code TOP to compute sectoral prograde and axisymmetric dipolar modes in {\gamma} Dor stars at different rotation rates and evolutionary stages. We then characterised the dips we obtained by their width and location on the period spacing diagram. We found that the width and the location of the dips depend quasi-linearly on the ratio of the rotation rate and the Brunt-Väisälä frequency at the core interface. This allowed us to determine empirical relations between width and location of dips on the one hand, and on the other, resonant inertial mode frequency in the core and Brunt-Väisälä frequency at the core/radiative zone interface. We also propose an approximate theoretical model to support and discuss these empirical relations. The empirical relations we established could be applied to dips observed in data, which would allow for the estimate of frequencies of resonant inertial modes in the core and of the Brunt-Väisälä jump at the interface between the core and the radiative zone. As those two parameters are both related to the evolutionary stage of the star, their determination could lead to more accurate estimations of stellar ages.
#### A multi-wavelength study of Galactic H II regions with extended emission

 - **Abstract**
 H II regions are the signposts of massive ($M\geq\,8\,M_\odot$) star-forming sites in our Galaxy. It has been observed that the ionizing photon rate inferred from the radio continuum emission of H II regions is significantly lower ($\sim$ 90%) than that inferred from far-infrared fluxes measured by IRAS. This discrepancy in the ionizing photon rates may arise due to there being significant amounts of dust within the H II regions or the presence of extended emission that is undetected by high-resolution radio interferometric observations. Here, we study a sample of eight compact and ultracompact H II regions with extended emission to explore its role in resolving the discrepancy. We have used observations at the uGMRT (1.25-1.45 GHz) and data from the GLOSTAR survey (4-8 GHz) to estimate the ionizing photon rate from the radio continuum emission. We have also estimated the ionizing photon rate from the infrared luminosity by fitting a spectral energy distribution function to the infrared data from the GLIMPSE, MIPSGAL, and Hi-GAL surveys. The excellent sensitivity of the radio observations to extended emission allows us to investigate the actual fraction of ionizing photons that are absorbed by dust in compact and ultracompact H II regions. Barring one source, we find a direct association between the radio continuum emission from the compact and diffuse components of the H II region. Our study shows that the ionizing photon rates estimated using the radio and infrared data are within reasonable agreement (5-28%) if we include the extended emission. We also find multiple candidate ionizing stars in all our sources, and the ionizing photon rates from the radio observations and candidate stars are in reasonable agreement.
#### AGN STORM 2: VIII. Investigating the Narrow Absorption Lines in Mrk 817 Using HST-COS Observations

 - **Abstract**
 We observed the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk817 during an intensive multi-wavelength reverberation mapping campaign for 16 months. Here, we examine the behavior of narrow UV absorption lines seen in HST/COS spectra, both during the campaign and in other epochs extending over 14 years. We conclude that while the narrow absorption outflow system (at -3750 km/s with FWHM=177 km/s) responds to the variations of the UV continuum as modified by the X-ray obscurer, its total column density (logNH =19.5 cm-2) did not change across all epochs. The adjusted ionization parameter (scaled with respect to the variations in the Hydrogen ionizing continuum flux) is log UH =-1.0. The outflow is located at a distance smaller than 38 parsecs from the central source, which implies a hydrogen density of nH > 3000 cm-3. The absorption outflow system only covers the continuum emission source and not the broad emission line region, which suggests that its transverse size is small (< 1e16 cm), with potential cloud geometries ranging from spherical to elongated along the line of sight.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop analytical tools and perform three-body simulations to investigate the orbital evolution and dynamical stability of binary planets within star clusters. Our analytical results show that the orbital stability of a planetary-mass binary against passing stars is mainly related to its orbital period. We find that critical flybys, defined as stellar encounters with energy kicks comparable to the binary binding energy, can efficiently produce a wide range of semimajor axes ($a$) and eccentricities ($e$) from a dominant population of primordially tight JuMBOs. Applying our results to the recently discovered Jupiter-Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), our simulations suggest that to match the observed $\sim$9\% wide binary fraction, an initial semimajor axis of $a_0 = 10$--20~au and a density-weighted residence time of $\chi \gtrsim 10^4$~Myr~pc$^{-3}$ are favored. These results imply that the JWST JuMBOs probably formed as tight binaries near the cluster core.
#### A spectroscopic and kinematic survey of fast hot subdwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 Hot subdwarfs (sdO/B) are the stripped helium cores of red giants formed by binary interactions. Close hot subdwarf binaries with massive white dwarf companions have been proposed as possible progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae type Ia (SN Ia). If the supernova is triggered by stable mass transfer from the helium star, the companion should survive the explosion and should be accelerated to high velocities. The hypervelocity star US 708 is regarded as the prototype for such an ejected companion. To find more of those objects we conducted an extensive spectroscopic survey. Candidates for such fast stars have been selected from the spectroscopic database of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and several ground-based proper motion surveys. Follow-up spectroscopy has been obtained with several 4m- to 10m-class telescopes. Combining the results from quantitative spectroscopic analyses with space-based astrometry from \textit{Gaia} Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) we determined the atmospheric and kinematic parameters of 53 fast hot subdwarf stars. None of these stars is unbound to the Galaxy, although some have Galactic restframe velocities close to the Galactic escape velocity. 21 stars are apparently single objects, which crossed the Galactic disc within their lifetimes in the sdO/B stage and could be regarded as potential candidates for the SN Ia ejection scenario. However, the properties of the full sample are more consistent with a pure old Galactic halo population. We therefore conclude that the fast sdO/B stars we found are likely to be extreme halo stars.
#### MIRI MRS Observations of Beta Pictoris II. The Spectroscopic Case for a Recent Giant Collision

 - **Abstract**
 Modeling observations of the archetypal debris disk around $\beta$ Pic, obtained in 2023 January with the MIRI MRS on board JWST, reveals significant differences compared with that obtained with the IRS on board Spitzer. The bright 5 - 15 $\mu$m continuum excess modeled using a $\sim$600 K black body has disappeared. The previously prominent 18 and 23 $\mu$m crystalline forsterite emission features, arising from cold dust ($\sim$100 K) in the Rayleigh limit, have disappeared and been replaced by very weak features arising from the hotter 500 K dust population. Finally, the shape of the 10 $\mu$m silicate feature has changed, consistent with a shift in the temperature of the warm dust population from $\sim$300 K to $\sim$500 K and an increase in the crystalline fraction of the warm, silicate dust. Stellar radiation pressure may have blown both the hot and the cold crystalline dust particles observed in the Spitzer spectra out of the planetary system during the intervening 20 years between the Spitzer and JWST observations. These results indicate that the $\beta$ Pic system has a dynamic circumstellar environment, and that periods of enhanced collisions can create large clouds of dust that sweep through the planetary system.
