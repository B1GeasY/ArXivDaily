#### Convective-core overshooting and the final fate of massive stars

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars can explode in powerful supernovae (SNe) forming neutron stars but they may also collapse directly into black holes (BHs). Understanding and predicting their final fate is increasingly important, e.g, in the context of gravitational-wave astronomy. The interior mixing of stars in general and convective boundary mixing remain some of the largest uncertainties in their evolution. Here, we investigate the influence of convective boundary mixing on the pre-SN structure and explosion properties of massive stars. Using the 1D stellar evolution code Mesa, we model single, non-rotating stars of solar metallicity with initial masses of $5-70\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and convective core step-overshooting of $0.05-0.50H_\mathrm{P}$. Stars are evolved until the onset of iron core collapse, and the pre-SN models are exploded using a parametric, semi-analytic SN code. We use the compactness parameter to describe the interior structure of stars at core collapse. Larger convective core overshooting shifts the location of the compactness peak by $1-2\mathrm{M_\odot}$ to higher $M_\mathrm{CO}$. As the luminosity of the pre-SN progenitor is determined by $M_\mathrm{CO}$, we predict BH formation for progenitors with luminosities $5.35<\log(L/\mathrm{L_\odot})<5.50$ and $\log(L/\mathrm{L_\odot})>5.80$. The luminosity range of BH formation agrees well with the observed luminosity of the red supergiant star N6946BH1 that disappeared without a bright SN and likely collapsed into a BH. While some of our models in the luminosity range $\log(L/\mathrm{L_\odot})=5.1-5.5$ indeed collapse to form BHs, this does not fully explain the lack of observed SN~IIP progenitors at these luminosities, ie the missing red-supergiant problem. Convective core overshooting affects the BH masses, the pre-SN location of stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, the plateau luminosity and duration of SN~IIP lightcurves.[Abridged]
#### A centi-pc-scale compact radio core in the nearby galaxy M60

 - **Abstract**
 M60, an elliptical galaxy located 16.5~Mpc away, has an active nucleus with a very low luminosity and an extremely low accretion rate. Its central supermassive black hole has a mass of $M_{\rm BH}\sim4.5\times10^{9}\, M_{\odot}$ and a Schwarzschild radii corresponding to $R_{\rm S}\sim5.4\,\mu\mathrm{as}$. To investigate the nature of its innermost radio nucleus, data from the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 4.4 and 7.6~GHz were reduced. The VLBA images reveal a compact component with total flux densities of $\sim$20~mJy at both frequencies, a size of $\leq$0.27~mas (99.7$\%$ confidence level), about 0.022~pc ($50\,R_{\rm S}$) at 7.6~GHz, and a brightness temperature of $\geq6\times10^{9}$~K. This suggests that the observed centi-parsec-scale compact core could be attributed to a nonthermal jet base or an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) with nonthermal electrons. The extremely compact structure also supports the presence of an SMBH in the center. Our results indicate that M60 is a promising target for broad-band VLBI observations at millimeter wavelengths to probe ADAF scenarios and tightly constrain the potential photon ring (about 28\,$\mu$as) around its SMBH.
#### The onset of stellar multiplicity in massive star formation: A search  for low-mass companions of massive young stellar objects with $L'$-band  adaptive optics imaging

 - **Abstract**
 Given the high incidence of binaries among mature field massive stars, it is clear that multiplicity is an inevitable outcome of high-mass star formation. Understanding how massive multiples form requires the study of the birth environments of massive stars, covering the innermost to outermost regions. We aim to detect and characterise low-mass companions around massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) during and shortly after their formation phase. To investigate large spatial scales, we carried out an $L'$-band high-contrast direct imaging survey seeking low-mass companions (down to $L_{\text{bol}}\approx 10 L_{\odot}$, or late A-type) around thirteen previously identified MYSOs using the VLT/NACO instrument. From those images, we looked for the presence of companions on a wide orbit, covering scales from 300 to 56,000 au. Detection limits were determined for all targets and we tested the gravitational binding to the central object based on chance projection probabilities. We have discovered a total of thirty-nine potential companions around eight MYSOs, the large majority of which have never been reported to date. We derived a multiplicity frequency (MF) of $62\pm13$% and a companion fraction (CF) of $3.0\pm0.5$. The derived MF and CF are compared to other studies for similar separation ranges. The comparisons are effective for a fixed evolutionary stage spanning a wide range of masses and vice versa. We find an increased MF and CF compared to the previous studies targeting MYSOs, showing that the statement in which multiplicity scales with primary mass also extends to younger evolutionary stages. The separations at which the companions are found and their location with relation to the primary star allow us to discuss the implications for the massive star formation theories.
