 - **Abstract**
 With four companions at separations from 16 to 71 au, HR 8799 is a unique target for direct imaging, presenting an opportunity for the comparative study of exoplanets with a shared formation history. Combining new VLTI/GRAVITY observations obtained within the ExoGRAVITY program with archival data, we perform a systematic atmospheric characterisation of all four planets. We explore different levels of model flexibility to understand the temperature structure, chemistry and clouds of each planet using both petitRADTRANS atmospheric retrievals and fits to self-consistent radiative-convective equilibrium models. Using Bayesian Model Averaging to combine multiple retrievals, we find that the HR 8799 planets are highly enriched in metals, with [M/H] $\gtrsim$1, and have stellar to super-stellar C/O ratios. The C/O ratio increases with increasing separation from $0.55^{+0.12}_{-0.10}$ for d to $0.78^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ for b, with the exception of the innermost planet which has a C/O ratio of $0.87\pm0.03$. By retrieving a quench pressure and using a disequilibrium chemistry model we derive vertical mixing strengths compatible with predictions for high-metallicity, self-luminous atmospheres. Bayesian evidence comparisons strongly favour the presence of HCN in HR 8799 c and e, as well as CH$_{4}$ in HR 8799 c, with detections at $>5\sigma$ confidence. All of the planets are cloudy, with no evidence for patchiness. The clouds of c, d and e are best fit by silicate clouds lying above a deep iron cloud layer, while the clouds of the cooler HR 8799 b are more likely composed of Na$_{2}$S. With well defined atmospheric properties, future exploration of this system is well positioned to unveil further detail in these planets, extending our understanding of the composition, structure, and formation history of these siblings.
#### Reevaluating the Origin of Detectable Cataclysmic Variables in Globular  Clusters: Testing the Importance of Dynamics

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the current detectable cataclysmic variable (CV) population in Galactic globular clusters (GCs), we show that there is not a clear relation between the number of sources per unit of mass and the stellar encounter rate, the cluster mass, or the cluster central density. If any, only in the case of core-collapsed GCs could there be an anticorrelation with the stellar encounter rate. Our findings contrast with previous studies where clear positive correlations were identified. Our results suggest that correlations between faint X-ray sources, from which often conclusions for the CV population are drawn, and the GC parameters considered here, are likely influenced by other type of X-ray sources, including other types of compact binaries, which have X-ray luminosities similar to CVs. The findings presented here also suggest that the role of primordial systems is more important than previously believed and that dynamical formation has less influence in the current detectable CV population. The long-standing paradigm that GCs are efficient factories of CVs formed via dynamical interactions does not seem to be supported by current observations.

 - **Abstract**
 FarView is an early-stage concept for a large, low-frequency radio observatory, manufactured in-situ on the lunar far side using metals extracted from the lunar regolith. It consists of 100,000 dipole antennas in compact subarrays distributed over a large area but with empty space between subarrays in a core-halo structure. FarView covers a total area of ~200 km2, has a dense core within the inner ~36 km2, and a ~power-law falloff of antenna density out to ~14 km from the center. With this design, it is relatively easy to identify multiple viable build sites on the lunar far side. The science case for FarView emphasizes the unique capabilities to probe the unexplored Cosmic Dark Ages - identified by the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey as the discovery area for cosmology. FarView will deliver power spectra and tomographic maps tracing the evolution of the Universe from before the birth of the first stars to the beginning of Cosmic Dawn, and potentially provide unique insights into dark matter, early dark energy, neutrino masses, and the physics of inflation. What makes FarView feasible and affordable in the timeframe of the 2030s is that it is manufactured in-situ, utilizing space industrial technologies. This in-situ manufacturing architecture utilizes Earth-built equipment that is transported to the lunar surface to extract metals from the regolith and will use those metals to manufacture most of the array components: dipole antennas, power lines, and silicon solar cell power systems. This approach also enables a long functional lifetime, by permitting servicing and repair of the observatory. The full 100,000 dipole FarView observatory will take 4 - 8 years to build, depending on the realized performance of the manufacturing elements and the lunar delivery scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 Filamentary structures are ubiquitously found in high-mass star-forming clouds. To investigate the relationship between filaments and star formation, we carry out the INFANT (INvestigations of massive Filaments ANd sTar formation) survey, a multi-scale, multi-wavelength survey of massive filamentary clouds with ALMA band 3/band 6 and VLA K band. In this first paper, we present the ALMA band 6 continuum observations toward a sample of 8 high-mass star forming filaments. We covered each target with approximately rectangular mosaic field of view with two 12-m array configurations, achieving an angular resolution of $\sim$0.6" (2700 AU at 4.5 kpc) and a continuum rms of $\sim$0.1 mJy/beam ($\sim$0.06 Msun in gas mass assuming 15 K). We identify cores using the getsf and astrodendro and find the former is more robust in terms of both identification and measuring flux densities. We identify in total 183 dense cores (15--36 cores in each cloud) and classify their star formation states via outflow and warm gas tracers. The protostellar cores are statistically more massive than the prestellar cores, possibly indicating further accretion onto cores after formation of protostars. For the high-mass end ($M_\text{core}$ $>$ 1.5 Msun) of the core mass function (CMF) we derive a power-law index of $-$1.15 $\pm$ 0.12 for the whole sample, and $-$1.70 $\pm$ 0.25 for the prestellar population. We also find a steepening trend in CMF with cloud evolution ($-$0.89 $\pm$ 0.15 for the young group v.s. $-$1.44 $\pm$ 0.25 for the evolved group) and discuss its implication for cluster formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova blast wave shock is a very important site of cosmic-ray acceleration. However, the detailed physical process of acceleration, in particular, non-linear interplay between cosmic-ray streaming and magnetic field amplification has not been studied under a realistic environment. In this paper, using a unique and novel numerical method, we study cosmic-ray acceleration at supernova blast wave shock propagating in the interstellar medium with well-resolved magnetic field amplification by non-resonant hybrid instability (or Bell instability). We find that the magnetic field is mildly amplified under typical ISM conditions that leads to maximum cosmic-ray energy ~30 TeV for supernova remnants with age ~1000 years consistent with gamma-ray observations. The strength of the amplified magnetic field does not reach so-called saturation level, because cosmic-ray electric current towards the shock upstream has finite spatial extent, by which Bell instability cannot experience many e-folding times.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the formation of high-redshift supermassive black holes (SMBHs) via the direct collapse of baryonic clouds, where the necessary formation of molecular hydrogen is supressed by a Lyman-Werner (LW) photon background from relic particle decay. We improve on existing studies by dynamically simulating the collapse, accounting for the adiabatic contraction of the DM halo, as well as the in-situ production of the LW photons within the cloud which reduce the impact of the cloud's shielding. We find a viable parameter space where the decay of either some or all of the dark matter could successfully lead to the direct collapse of a SMBH.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of equation of state for the matter in the neutron star plays an important role in determining its maximal mass. In addition, it must comply with the condition of causality. Noting that the central density of a maximally massive neutron star is well above the nuclear saturation density, a deconfined quark core in the central region is motivated in this paper. We analyze this scenario by employing the MIT bag model to represent the core region and one of the unified equations of state for the region outside the core. Such combination is found to solve the problem of causality violation. In each case of the combined equations of state, the radial profile of $\rho r^2$ displays a peak and dominant contribution to the total mass of the star comes from the region around the peak value of $\rho r^2$, whereas the contribution is small from the regions near the center and the surface. This peak occurs in the region of hadronic matter for the combinations considered in this paper. Importantly, we find that the position of the peak in $\rho r^2$ is well-correlated with the maximal mass -- the highest value of $1.98\ M_\odot$ obtains for the case with the peak occurring farthest from the center. This gravitational threshold being obtained for a non-rotating neutron star, we expect the threshold to lie well above 2 $ M_\odot$ for a rapidly rotating neutron star, that may explain the existance of massive pulsars from recent astronomical observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We previously studied the inner crust and the pasta mantle of a neutron star within the 4th-order extended Thomas-Fermi (ETF) approach with consistent proton shell corrections added perturbatively via the Strutinsky integral (SI) theorem together with the contribution due to pairing. To speed up the computations and avoid numerical problems, we adopted parametrized nucleon density distributions. However, the errors incurred by the choice of the parametrization are expected to become more significant as the mean baryon number density is increased, especially in the pasta mantle where the differences in the energy per nucleon of the different phases are very small, typically a few keV. To improve the description of these exotic structures, we discuss the important features that a nuclear profile should fulfill and introduce two new parametrizations. Performing calculations using the BSk24 functional, we find that these parametrizations lead to lower ETF energy solutions for all pasta phases than the parametrization we adopted before and more accurately reproduce the exact equilibrium nucleon density distributions obtained from unconstrained variational calculations. Within the ETFSI method, all parametrizations predict the same composition in the region with quasi-spherical clusters. However, the two new parametrizations lead to a different mantle structure at mean baryon densities above about 0.07 fm^-3, at which point lasagna is energetically favored. Interestingly, spherical clusters reappear in the pasta region. The inverted pasta phases such as bucatini and Swiss cheese are still found in the densest region above the core in all cases.
#### Habitability constraints by nutrient availability in atmospheres of  rocky exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 Life as we know it requires the presence of liquid water and the availability of nutrients, which are mainly based on the elements C, H, N, O, P, and S (CHNOPS) and trace metal micronutrients. We aim to understand the presence of these nutrients within atmospheres that show the presence of water cloud condensates, potentially allowing the existence of aerial biospheres. In this paper we introduce a framework of nutrient availability levels based on the presence of water condensates and the chemical state of the CHNOPS elements. These nutrient availability levels are applied to a set of atmospheric models based on different planetary surface compositions resulting in a range of atmospheric compositions. The atmospheric model is a bottom-to-top equilibrium chemistry atmospheric model which includes the atmosphere-crust interaction and the element depletion due to the formation of clouds. While the reduced forms of CNS are present at the water cloud base for most atmospheric compositions, P and metals are lacking. This indicates the potential bio-availability of CNS, while P and metals are limiting factors for aerial biospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Near-Earth objects (NEOs) on an impact course with Earth can move at high angular speed. Understanding their properties, including rotation state, is crucial for assessing impact risks and mitigation strategies. Traditional photometric methods face challenges in collecting data on fast-moving NEOs accurately. Aims. This study introduces an innovative approach to aperture photometry tailored to analyzing trailed images of fast-moving NEOs. Our primary aim is to extract rotation state information from these observations, particularly focusing on the efficacy of this technique for fast rotators. Methods. We applied our approach to analyze the trailed images of three asteroids: 2023 CX1, 2024 BX1, and 2024 EF, which were either on a collision courses or performing a close fly-by with Earth. By adjusting aperture sizes, we controlled the effective exposure times to increase the sampling rates of the photometric variations. This enabled us to detect short rotation periods that would be challenging with conventional methods. Results. Our analysis revealed that trailed photometry significantly reduces overhead time associated with CCD read-out, enhancing the sampling rate of the photometric variations. We demonstrated that this technique is particularly effective for fast-moving objects, providing reliable photometric data when the object is at its brightest and closest to Earth. For asteroid 2024 BX1, we detected a rotation period as short as 2.5888 +- 0.0002 seconds, the fastest ever recorded. Our findings underscore the efficacy of trailed observations coupled with aperture photometry for studying the rotation characteristics of small NEOs, offering crucial insights for impact risk assessment and mitigation strategies.
#### Early evolution of spin direction in dark matter halos and the effect of  the surrounding large-scale tidal field

 - **Abstract**
 It is usually assumed that the angular momentum (AM) of dark matter halos arises during the linear stages of structure formation, as a consequence of the coupling between the proto-haloes' shape and the tidal field produced by their surrounding density perturbations. This approach, known as linear tidal torque theory (TTT), has been shown to make fairly good predictions about the mean evolution of both the AM amplitude and orientation up to approximately the time when the proto-haloes collapse. After this point, proto-haloes are increasingly affected by non-linear processes that are not taken into account by the model. However, it has been seen in numerical simulations that, even at very early stages, the AM of proto-haloes is systematically reoriented towards perpendicularity with respect to the forming cosmic filaments, in contradiction with the fixed direction expected from the TTT. In this work we present a novel analytical approach that introduces an anisotropic scaling factor to the standard TTT equations, which allows the AM orientation to change in time, even during the linear regime. The amplitude and direction of this shift depend on the large scale tidal field around the forming proto-haloes. Our results significantly improve the predictions for the AM direction up to the time of protohalo collapse and, in some cases, even further in time.
