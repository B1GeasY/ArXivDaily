#### The Role of a Neutron Component in the Photospheric Emission of  Long-Duration Gamma-Ray Burst Jets

 - **Abstract**
 Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), thought to be produced during core-collapse supernovae, may have a prominent neutron component in the outflow material. If present, neutrons can change how photons scatter in the outflow by reducing its opacity, thereby allowing the photons to decouple sooner than if there were no neutrons present. Understanding the details of this process could therefore allow us to probe the central engine of LGRBs, which is otherwise hidden. Here, we present results of the photospheric emission from an LGRB jet, using a combination of relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and radiative transfer post-processing using the Monte Carlo Radiation Transfer (MCRaT) code. We control the size of the neutron component in the jet material by varying the equilibrium electron fraction $Y_{e}$, and we find that the presence of neutrons in the GRB fireball affects the Band parameters $\alpha$ and $E_{0}$, while the picture with the $\beta$ parameter is less clear. In particular, the break energy $E_{0}$ is shifted to higher energies. Additionally, we find that increasing the size of the neutron component also increases the total radiated energy of the outflow across multiple viewing angles. Our results not only shed light on LGRBs, but are also relevant to short-duration gamma-ray bursts associated with binary neutron star mergers, due to the likelihood of a prominent neutron component in such systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic filaments, the most prominent features of the cosmic web, possibly hold untapped potential for cosmological inference. While it is natural to expect the structure of filaments to show universality similar to that seen in dark matter halos, the lack of agreement between different filament finders on what constitutes a filament has hampered progress on this topic. We initiate a programme to systematically investigate and uncover possible universal features in the phase space structure of cosmic filaments, by generating particle realizations of mock filaments with $\textit{a priori}$ known properties. Using these, we identify an important source of bias in the extraction of radial density profiles, which occurs when the local curvature $\kappa$ of the spine exceeds a threshold determined by the filament thickness. This bias exists even for perfectly determined spines, thus affecting $\textit{all}$ filament finders. We show that this bias can be nearly eliminated by simply discarding the regions with the highest $\kappa$, with little loss of precision. An additional source of bias is the noise generated by the filament finder when identifying the spine, which depends on both the finder algorithm as well as intrinsic properties of the individual filament. We find that, to mitigate this bias, it is essential not only to smooth the estimated spine, but to $\textit{optimize}$ this smoothing separately for each filament. We propose a novel optimization based on minimizing the estimated filament thickness, along with Fourier space smoothing. We implement these techniques using two tools, $\texttt{FilGen}$ which generates mock filaments and $\texttt{FilAPT}$ which analyses and processes them. We expect these tools to be useful in calibrating the performance of filament finders, thereby enabling searches for filament universality.
#### Exploring the distribution and impact of bosonic dark matter in neutron  stars

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of dark matter (DM) within neutron stars (NSs) can be introduced by different accumulation scenarios in which DM and baryonic matter (BM) may interact only through the gravitational force. In this work, we consider asymmetric self-interacting bosonic DM which can reside as a dense core inside the NS or form an extended halo around it. It is seen that depending on the boson mass ($m_{\chi}$), self-coupling constant ($\lambda$) and DM fraction ($F_{\chi}$), the maximum mass, radius and tidal deformability of NSs with DM admixture will be altered significantly. The impact of DM causes some modifications in the observable features induced solely by the BM component. Here, we focus on the widely used nuclear matter equation of state (EoS) called DD2 for describing NS matter. We show that by involving DM in NSs, the corresponding observational parameters will be changed to be consistent with the latest multi-messenger observations of NSs. It is seen that for $m_{\chi}\gtrsim200$ MeV and $\lambda\lesssim2\pi$, DM admixed NSs with $4\%\lesssim F_{\chi}\lesssim20\%$ are consistent with the maximum mass and tidal deformability constraints.

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular clouds are prime locations to study the process of star formation. These clouds contain filamentary structures and cores, which are crucial sites for the formation of young stars. The star-formation process has been investigated using various techniques, including polarimetry for tracing magnetic fields. In this small review-cum-short report, we put together the efforts (mainly from the Indian community) to understand the roles of turbulence and magnetic fields in star formation. These are two components of the ISM competing against gravity, which is primarily responsible for the collapse of gas to form stars. We also include attempts made using simulations of molecular clouds to study this competition. Studies on feedback and magnetic fields are combined and listed to understand the importance of the interaction between two energies in setting the current observed star formation efficiency. We have listed available and upcoming facilities with the polarization capabilities needed to trace magnetic fields. We have also stated the importance of ongoing and desired collaborations between Indian communities and facilities abroad to shed more light on the roles of turbulence and magnetic fields in the process of star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 This study introduces an approach to detecting exocomet transits in the dataset of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), specifically within its Sector 1. Given the limited number of exocomet transits detected in the observed light curves, creating a sufficient training sample for the machine learning method was challenging. We developed a unique training sample by encapsulating simulated asymmetric transit profiles into observed light curves, thereby creating realistic data for the model training. To analyze these light curves, we employed the TSFresh software, which was a tool for extracting key features that were then used to refine our Random Forest model training. Considering that cometary transits typically exhibit a small depth, less than 1% of the star's brightness, we chose to limit our sample to the CDPP parameter. Our study focused on two target samples: light curves with a CDPP of less than 40 ppm and light curves with a CDPP of up to 150 ppm. Each sample was accompanied by a corresponding training set. This methodology achieved an accuracy of approximately 96%, with both precision and recall rates exceeding 95% and a balanced F1-score of around 96%. This level of accuracy was effective in distinguishing between 'exocomet candidate' and 'non-candidate' classifications for light curves with a CDPP of less than 40 ppm, and our model identified 12 potential exocomet candidates. However, when applying machine learning to less accurate light curves (CDPP up to 150 ppm), we noticed a significant increase in curves that could not be confidently classified, but even in this case, our model identified 20 potential exocomet candidates. These promising results within Sector 1 motivate us to extend our analysis across all TESS sectors to detect and study comet-like activity in the extrasolar planetary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Streamers bring gas from outer regions to protostellar systems and could change the chemical composition around protostars and protoplanetary disks. We have carried out mapping observations of carbon-chain species (HC$_3$N, HC$_5$N, CCH, and CCS) in the 3mm and 7mm bands toward the streamer flowing to the Class 0 young stellar object (YSO) Per-emb-2 with the Nobeyama 45m radio telescope. A region with a diameter of $\sim0.04$ pc is located north with a distance of $\sim 20,500$ au from the YSO. The streamer connects to this north region which is the origin of the streamer. The reservoir has high density and low temperature ($n_{\rm {H}_2} \approx 1.9 \times 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$, $T_{\rm {kin}} = 10$ K), which are similar to those of early stage starless cores. By comparisons with the observed abundance ratios of CCS/HC$_3$N to the chemical simulations, the reservoir and streamer are found to be chemically young. The total mass available for the streamer is derived to be $24-34$ M$_{\odot}$. If all of the gas in the reservoir will accrete onto the Per-emb-2 protostellar system, the lifetime of the streamer has been estimated at ($1.1 - 3.2$)$\times10^{5}$ yr, suggesting that the mass accretion via the streamer would continue until the end of the Class I stage.

 - **Abstract**
 An updated catalog consisting of 1092 6.7-GHz methanol maser sources was reported in this work. Additionally, the NH3 (1, 1), NH3 (2, 2), and NH3 (3, 3) transitions were observed towards 214 star forming regions using the Shanghai Tianma radio telescope (TMRT) in order to examine the differences in physical environments, such as excitation temperature and column density of molecular clouds associated with methanol masers on the Galactic scale. Statistical results reveal that the number of 6.7 GHz methanol masers in the Perseus arm is significantly lower than that in the other three main spiral arms. In addition, the Perseus arm also has the lowest gas column density among the main spiral arms traced by the NH3 observations. Both of these findings suggest that the Perseus arm has the lowest rate of high-mass star formation compared to the other three main spiral arms. We also observed a trend in which both the luminosity of 6.7 GHz methanol masers and the ammonia gas column density decreased as the galactocentric distances. This finding indicates that the density of material in the inner Milky Way is generally higher than that in the outer Milky Way. It further suggests that high-mass stars are more easily formed at the head of spiral arms. Furthermore, we found that the column density of ammonia gas is higher in the regions on the arms than that in the inter-arm regions, supporting that the former is more likely to be the birthplace of high-mass stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast flavor conversions (FFCs) of neutrinos, which can occur in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), are multiangle effects. They depend on the angular distribution of the neutrino's electron lepton number (ELN). In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the FFCs by solving the multienergy and multiangle quantum kinetic equations with an extended set of collisional weak processes based on a static and spherically symmetric CCSN matter background profile. We investigate the emergence and evolution of FFCs in models featuring different ELN angular distributions, considering scenarios with two and three neutrino flavors. The spectrogram method is utilized to illustrate the small-scale spatial structure, and we show that this structure of neutrino flavor coherence and number densities in the nonlinear regime is qualitatively consistent with the dispersion relation analysis. On the coarse-grained level, we find that different asymptotic states can be achieved following the FFCs depending on the locations and shapes of the ELN distributions, despite sharing a common feature of the elimination of the ELN angular crossing. While equilibration among different neutrino flavors may be achieved immediately after the prompt FFCs, it is not a general outcome of the asymptotic state, as subsequent feedback effects from collisional neutrino-matter interactions come into play, particularly for cases where FFCs occur inside the neutrinosphere. The impacts of FFCs and the feedback effect on the net neutrino heating rates, the equilibrium electron fraction of CCSN matter, and the free-streaming neutrino energy spectra are quantitatively assessed. Other aspects including the impact of the vacuum term and the coexistence with other type of flavor instabilities are also discussed.
#### The impact of the explicit representation of convection on the climate  of a tidally locked planet in global stretched-mesh simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Convective processes are crucial in shaping exoplanetary atmospheres but are computationally expensive to simulate directly. A novel technique of simulating moist convection on tidally locked exoplanets is to use a global 3D model with a stretched mesh. This allows us to locally refine the model resolution to 4.7 km and resolve fine-scale convective processes without relying on parameterizations. We explore the impact of mesh stretching on the climate of a slowly rotating TRAPPIST-1e-like planet, assuming it is 1:1 tidally locked. In the stretched-mesh simulation with explicit convection, the climate is 5 K colder and 25% drier than that in the simulations with parameterized convection. This is due to the increased cloud reflectivity and exacerbated by the diminished greenhouse effect due to less water vapor. At the same time, our stretched-mesh simulations reproduce the key characteristics of the global climate of tidally locked rocky exoplanets, without any noticeable numerical artifacts. Our methodology opens an exciting and computationally feasible avenue for improving our understanding of 3D mixing in exoplanetary atmospheres. Our study also demonstrates the feasibility of a global stretched mesh configuration for LFRic-Atmosphere, the next-generation Met Office climate and weather model.
#### Searching for NLTE effects in the high-resolution transmission spectrum  of WASP-121 b with Cloudy for Exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) undergo intense irradiation by their host stars and are expected to experience non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects in their atmospheres. Such effects are computationally intensive to model but, at the low pressures probed by high-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS), can significantly impact the formation of spectral lines. The UHJ WASP-121 b exhibits a highly inflated atmosphere, making it ideal for investigating the impact of NLTE effects on its transmission spectrum. Here, we formally introduce Cloudy for Exoplanets, a Cloudy-based modelling code, and use it to generate 1-D LTE and NLTE atmospheric models and spectra to analyse archival HARPS WASP-121 b transmission spectra. We assessed the models using two HRCCS methods: i) Pearson cross-correlation, and ii) a method that aims to match the average observed line depth for given atmospheric species. All models result in strong detections of Fe I ($7.5<S/N<10.5$). However, the highest S/N model (LTE) does not agree with the best-matching model of the average line depth (NLTE). We also find degeneracy, such that increasing the isothermal temperature and metallicity of the LTE models can produce average line depths similar to cooler, less metal rich NLTE models. Thus, we are unable to conclusively remark on the presence of NLTE effects in the atmosphere of WASP-121 b. We instead highlight the need for standardised metrics in HRCCS that enable robust statistical assessment of complex physical models, e.g. NLTE or 3-D effects, that are currently too computationally intensive to include in HRCCS atmospheric retrievals.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-frequency radio observations of diffuse synchrotron radiation offer a unique vantage point for investigating the intricate relationship between gas and magnetic fields in the formation of structures within the Galaxy, spanning from the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) to star-forming regions. Achieving this pivotal objective hinges on a comprehensive understanding of cosmic-ray properties, which dictate the effective energy distribution of relativistic electrons, primarily responsible for the observable synchrotron radiation. Notably, cosmic-ray electrons (CRe) with energies between 100 MeV and 10 GeV play a crucial role in determining the majority of the sky brightness below the GHz range. However, their energy flux ($j_e$) remains elusive due to solar modulation. We propose deriving observational constraints on this energy gap of interstellar CRe through the brightness temperature spectral index of low-frequency radio emission, here denoted as $\beta_{\rm obs}$. We introduce a new parametric analytical model that fits available data of $j_e$ in accordance with the $\beta_{\rm obs}$ values measured in the literature between 50 MHz to 1 GHz for diffuse emission in the Milky Way. Our model allows to account for multiple observations considering magnetic-field strengths consistent with existing measurements below 10 $\mu$G. We present a first all-sky map of the average component of the magnetic field perpendicular to the line of sight and validate our methodology against state-of-the art numerical simulations of the diffuse ISM. This research makes headway in modeling Galactic diffuse emission with a practical parametric form. It provides essential insights in preparation for the imminent arrival of the Square Kilometre Array.
#### The effect of cloudy atmospheres on the thermal evolution of warm giant  planets from an interior modelling perspective

 - **Abstract**
 We are interested in the influence of cloudy atmospheres on the thermal radius evolution of warm exoplanets from an interior modelling perspective. By applying a physically motivated but simple parameterized cloud model, we obtain the atmospheric $P$-$T$ structure that is connected to the adiabatic interior at the self-consistently calculated radiative-convective boundary. We investigate the impact of cloud gradients, with the possibility of inhibiting superadiabatic clouds. Furthermore, we explore the impact on the radius evolution for a cloud base fixed at a certain pressure versus a subsiding cloud base during the planets' thermal evolution. We find that deep clouds clearly alter the evolution tracks of warm giants, leading to either slower/faster cooling than in the cloudless case (depending on the cloud model used). When comparing the fixed versus dynamic cloud base during evolution, we see an enhanced behaviour resulting in a faster or slower cooling in the case of the dynamic cloud base. We show that atmospheric models including deep clouds can lead to degeneracy in predicting the bulk metallicity of planets, $Z_\mathrm{P}$. For WASP-10b, we find a possible span of $\approx {Z_\mathrm{P}}_{-0.06}^{+0.10}$. For TOI-1268b, it is $\approx {Z_\mathrm{P}}_{-0.05}^{+0.10}$. Further work on cloud properties during the long-term evolution of gas giants is needed to better estimate the influence on the radius evolution.
