 - **Abstract**
 Stars with initial mass above roughly 8 solar masses will evolve to form a core made of iron group elements at which point no further exothermic nuclear reactions between charged nuclei may prevent the core collapse. Electron captures, neutrino losses, and the photo-disintegration of heavy nuclei trigger the collapse of these stars. Models at the brink of core collapse are produced using stellar evolution codes and these pre-collapse models may be used in the study of the subsequent dynamical evolution (including their explosion as supernovae and the formation of compact remnants such as neutron stars or black holes). We upgrade the physical ingredients employed by the GENeva stellar Evolution Code, GENEC, so that it may cover the regime of high temperatures and high densities required to produce progenitors of core-collapse. We have improved GENEC in three directions, equation of state, the nuclear reaction network and the radiative and conductive opacities adapted for the computation of the advanced phases of evolution. We produce a small grid of pre-supernova models of stars with zero-age main sequence masses of 15, 20 and 25 solar masses at solar and less than half solar metallicities. The results are compared with analogous models produced with the MESA code. The global properties of our new models, particularly of their inner cores, are comparable to models computed with MESA and pre-existing progenitors in the literature. Between codes the exact shell structure varies impacting explosion predictions. Using GENEC with state-of-the-art physics, we have produced massive stellar progenitors prior to collapse. These progenitors are suitable for follow-up studies, including the dynamical collapse and supernova phases. Larger grids of supernova progenitors are now feasible, with potential for further dynamical evolution.
#### The Galactic Center in Color: Measuring Extinction with High-Proper-Motion Stars

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way's central parsec is a highly extinguished region with a population of high-proper-motion stars. We have tracked 145 stars for $\sim$10 years at wavelengths between 1 and 4 microns to analyze extinction effects in color-magnitude space. Approximately $30\%$ of this sample dims and reddens over the course of years, likely from the motion of sources relative to an inhomogeneous screen of dust. We correct previous measurements of the intrinsic variability fraction for differential extinction effects, resulting in a reduced stellar variability fraction of $34\%$. The extinction variability sub-sample shows that the extinguishing material has sub-arcsecond scales, much smaller variations than previously reported. The observed extinction events imply a typical cross-section of 500 AU and a density of around $3 \times 10^{4} \ \mathrm{atoms/cm^{3}}$ for the extinguishing material, which are consistent with measurements of filamentary dust and gas at the Galactic Center. Furthermore, given that the stars showing extinction variability tend to be more highly reddened than the rest of the sample, the extinction changes are likely due to material localized to the Galactic Center region. We estimate the relative extinction between 1 and 4 microns as, $\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{H}}:\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{K'}}:\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{L'}} = 1.67 \pm 0.05:1:0.69 \pm 0.03$. Our measurement of extinction at longer wavelengths -- L' (3.8 $\mu$m) -- is inconsistent with recent estimations of the integrated extinction towards the central parsec. One interpretation of this difference is that the dust variations this experiment is sensitive to -- which are local to the Galactic Center -- are dominated by grains of larger radius than the foreground.
#### A deeper investigation of the Primordial Binary Cluster

 - **Abstract**
 We hereby reported a new physical binary cluster (ASCC~19 and ASCC~21) near the Orion star-forming complex based on the data in the literature. Analysis of the results shows that it is a primordial binary cluster. It is possible that this binary cluster is undergoing two-body relaxation by inspecting the radial velocity anomalies of its member stars. In addition, based on the analysis of its metal abundances, we found that the components of this binary cluster may have been formed by the deep fusion of multiple subclusters. Finally, we investigated the 3D morphology of this binary cluster, simulated the trajectories of its components in the galactic disk, and concluded that its components may not merge into a single cluster.
#### Formation of WNL stars for the MW and LMC based on the k-omega model

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03687

 - **Abstract**
 We adopt a set of second-order differential equations ($k-\omega$ model) to handle core convective overshooting in massive stars, simulate the evolution of WNL stars with different metallicities and initial masses, both rotating and non-rotating models, and compare the results with the classical overshooting model. The results indicate that under the same initial conditions, the $k-\omega$ model generally produces larger convective cores and wider overshooting regions, thereby increasing the mass ranges and extending the lifetimes of WNL stars, as well as the likelihood of forming WNL stars. The masses and lifetimes of WNL stars both increase with higher metallicities and initial masses. Under higher-metallicity conditions, the two overshooting schemes significantly differ in their impacts on lifetimes of the WNL stars, but insignificant in the mass ranges of the WNL stars. Rotation may drive the formation of WNL stars in low-mass, metal-poor counterparts, with this effect being more pronounced in the OV model. The surface nitrogen of metal-rich WNL stars formed during the MS phase is likely primarily from the CN-cycle, while it may come from both the CN- and NO-cycles for relatively metal-poor counterparts. Our model can effectively explain the distribution of WNL stars in the Milky Way, but appears to have inadequacies in explaining the WNL stars in the LMC.
#### Advancing spectroscopic understanding of HOCS$^+$: Laboratory investigations and astronomical implications

 - **Abstract**
 Sulphur-bearing species play crucial roles in interstellar chemistry, yet their precise characterisation remains challenging. Here, we present laboratory experiments aimed at extending the high-resolution spectroscopy of protonated carbonyl sulphide (HOCS$^+$), a recently detected molecular ion in space. Using a frequency-modulated free-space absorption spectrometer, we detected rotational transitions of HOCS$^+$ in an extended negative glow discharge with a mixture of H$_2$ and OCS, extending the high-resolution rotational characterisation of the cation well into the millimetre wave region (200-370 GHz). Comparisons with prior measurements and quantum chemical calculations revealed an overall agreement in the spectroscopic parameters. With the new spectroscopic dataset in hand, we re-investigated the observations of HOCS$^+$ towards G+0.693-0.027, which were initially based solely on K$_a$ = 0 lines contaminated by HNC$^{34}$S. This re-investigation enabled the detection of weak K$_a$ = 0 transitions, free from HNC$^{34}$S contamination. Our high-resolution spectroscopic characterisation also provides valuable insights for future millimetre and submillimetre astronomical observations of these species in different interstellar environments. In particular, the new high-resolution catalogue will facilitate the search for this cation in cold dark clouds, where very narrow line widths are typically observed.

 - **Abstract**
 The future of time-domain optical astronomy relies on the development of techniques and software capable of handling a rising amount of data and gradually complementing, or replacing if necessary, real observations. Next generation surveys, like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), will open the door to the new era of optical astrophysics, creating, at the same time, a deficiency in spectroscopic data necessary to confirm the nature of each event and to fully recover the parametric space. In this framework, we developed Core collApse Supernovae parameTers estimatOR (CASTOR), a novel software for data analysis. CASTOR combines Gaussian Process and other Machine Learning techniques to build time-series templates of synthetic spectra and to estimate parameters of core collapse supernovae for which only multi-band photometry is available. Techniques to build templates are fully data driven and non-parametric through empirical and robust models, and rely on the direct comparison with a training set of 111 core collapse supernovae from the literature. Furthermore, CASTOR employees the real photometric data and the reconstructed synthetic spectra of an event to estimate parameters that belong to the supernova ejecta, to the stellar progenitor and to the event itself, in a rapid and user-friendly framework. In this work we provide a demonstration of how CASTOR works, studying available data from SN2015ap and comparing our results with those available in literature.
