 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of observations aimed at discovering and studying pulsars in the core-collapsed globular cluster (GC) NGC 6522 performed by the MeerTIME and TRAPUM Large Survey Project with the MeerKAT telescope. We have discovered two new isolated pulsars bringing the total number of known pulsars in the cluster to six. PSR J1803$-$3002E is a mildly recycled pulsar with spin period of 17.9 ms while pulsar PSR J1803$-$3002F is a slow pulsar with spin period of 148.1 ms. The presence of isolated and slow pulsars is expected in NGC 6522 and confirms the predictions of previous theories for clusters at this stage in evolution. We further present a tentative timing solution for the millisecond pulsar (MSP) PSR J1803$-$3002C combining older observations taken with the Parkes 64m radio telescope, Murriyang. This solution implies a relatively small characteristic age of the pulsar in contrast with the old age of the GC. The presence of a slow pulsar and an apparently young MSP, both rare in GCs, suggests that their formation might be linked to the evolutionary stage of the cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos in dense environments like core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and neutron star mergers (NSMs) can undergo fast flavor conversions (FFCs) once the angular distribution of neutrino lepton number crosses zero along a certain direction. Recent advancements have demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) in detecting these crossings. In this study, we enhance prior research in two significant ways. Firstly, we utilize realistic data from CCSN simulations, where neutrino transport is solved using the full Boltzmann equation. We evaluate the ML methods' adaptability in a real-world context, enhancing their robustness. In particular, we demonstrate that when working with artificial data, simpler models outperform their more complex counterparts, a noteworthy illustration of the bias-variance tradeoff in the context of ML. We also explore methods to improve artificial datasets for ML training. In addition, we extend our ML techniques to detect the crossings in the heavy-leptonic channels, accommodating scenarios where $\nu_x$ and $\bar\nu_x$ may differ. Our research highlights the extensive versatility and effectiveness of ML techniques, presenting an unparalleled opportunity to evaluate the occurrence of FFCs in CCSN and NSM simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The results of a spectral survey of the region of massive star formation DR21OH in the 4-mm wavelength range are presented. Sixty-nine molecules and their isotopologues have been detected, ranging from simple diatomic or triatomic species such as SO, SiO and CCH, to complex organic molecules such as CH$_3$OCHO or CH$_3$OCH$_3$. The obtained results qualitatively repeat the results of the survey of the same source at 3~mm. The inventories of molecules found at 3mm and 4mm overlap to a great extent. However, at 4 mm we found a number of species that have no allowed transitions in the 3-mm wavelength range, e.g. DCN, DNC, or SO$^+$. The bulk of the molecules detected at 4~mm are those that are common for dense cores, e.g., HC$_3$N or CH$_3$CCH, but some of the detected species are typical for hot cores. The latter include complex organic molecules CH$_3$OCHO, CH$_3$CH$_2$OH, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, etc. However, the detected emission of these molecules probably arises in a gas heated to 30 K only. Nine molecules, including complex species CH$_3$C$_3$N, CH$_3$CH$_2$CN, CH$_3$COCH$_3$, were found by spectral line stacking. This demonstrates the prospects of the method in the study of molecular clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 The BL Lac 1ES 2344+514 is known for temporary extreme properties (e.g., a shift of the synchrotron SED peak energy $\nu_{synch,p}$ above 1keV). While those extreme states were so far observed only during high flux levels, additional multi-year observing campaigns are required to achieve a coherent picture. Here, we report the longest investigation of the source from radio to VHE performed so far, focusing on a systematic characterisation of the intermittent extreme states. While our results confirm that 1ES 2344+514 typically exhibits $\nu_{synch,p}>$1keV during elevated flux periods, we also find periods where the extreme state coincides with low flux activity. A strong spectral variability thus happens in the quiescent state, and is likely caused by an increase of the electron acceleration efficiency without a change in the electron injection luminosity. We also report a strong X-ray flare (among the brightest for 1ES 2344+514) without a significant shift of $\nu_{synch,p}$. During this particular flare, the X-ray spectrum is among the softest of the campaign. It unveils complexity in the spectral evolution, where the common harder-when-brighter trend observed in BL Lacs is violated. During a low and hard X-ray state, we find an excess of the UV flux with respect to an extrapolation of the X-ray spectrum to lower energies. This UV excess implies that at least two regions contribute significantly to the infrared/optical/ultraviolet/X-ray emission. Using the simultaneous MAGIC, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and AstroSat observations, we argue that a region possibly associated with the 10 GHz radio core may explain such an excess. Finally, we investigate a VHE flare, showing an absence of simultaneous variability in the 0.3-2keV band. Using a time-dependent leptonic modelling, we show that this behaviour, in contradiction to single-zone scenarios, can instead be explained by a two-component model.

 - **Abstract**
 We present ALMA sub-arcsecond-resolution observations of both continuum and molecular lines at 345 GHz towards the massive star-forming region IRAS 16351-4722 (hereafter I16351). A total of 12 dust cores were detected based on high spatial resolution observations of the continuum. Among them, a high-mass core (11.6 Msun) and a low-mass core (1.7 Msun) show abundant molecular line emissions. 164 molecular transitions from 29 species and 104 molecular transitions from 25 species are identified in the high-mass and low-mass cores, respectively. Complex organic molecules (COMs) such as CH3OH, CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3, C2H5OH, and C2H5CN are detected in the two cores. Under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), rotational temperatures and column densities of the COMs are derived with the XCLASS software. The maximum rotation temperature values in the low-mass core and the high-mass core were found to be approximately 130 K and 198 K, respectively. Additionally, the line widths in the high-mass core are larger than those in the low-mass one. Abundant complex organic molecular line transitions, high gas temperatures, and smaller line widths indicate the presence of a low-mass line-rich core in the massive star formation region for the first time, while the high-mass line-rich core shows hot core property. When comparing the molecular abundances of CH3OH, CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3 and C2H5OH of the two cores with other hot cores and hot corinos reported in the literature, we further confirm that both a hot core and a low-mass line-rich core are simultaneously detected in I16351.

 - **Abstract**
 Double white dwarf systems are of great astrophysical importance in the field of gravitational wave and Type Ia supernova. While the binary fraction of CO core white dwarf is about a few percents, the extremely low mass white dwarfs are all thought to be within binary systems. In this work, we report the orbital solution of a double degenerate system: J033847.06+413424.24, an extremely low mass He core white dwarf orbiting a CO core white dwarf. With LAMOST and P200, time domain spectroscopic observations have been made and spectral atmosphere parameters are estimated to be $T_{\rm eff}\sim22500$ K and log $g\sim5.6$ dex. Combining Gaia parallax, 3D extinction, and evolution tracks, we estimate a radius of $\sim0.12$ $R_{\odot}$ and a mass of $\sim0.22$ $M_{\odot}$. With the 37 single exposure spectra, the radial velocities are measured and the orbital parameters are estimated to be $P=0.1253132(1)$ days, $K1=289\pm4$ km/s and $V_{sys}=-41\pm3$ km/s. The radial velocity based system ephemeris is also provided. The light curves from several photometric surveys show no orbital modulation. The orbital solution suggests that the invisible companion has a minimum mass of about 0.60 $M_{\odot}$ and is $\sim0.79$ $M_{\odot}$ for an inclination of $60.0^{\circ}$, indicating most probably a CO core white dwarf. The system is expected to merge in about 1 Gyr. With present period and distance ($\sim596$ pc) it can not irradiate strong enough gravitational wave for LISA. More double degenerate systems are expected to be discovered and parameterized as the LAMOST survey goes on.

 - **Abstract**
 It is a challenge to study the formation process of massive stars: their formation time is short, they are few, often deeply embedded, and at relatively large distances. Our strategy is to study the outcome of the star formation process and to look for signatures remnant of the formation. We have access to a unique sample of (massive) pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in the giant HII region M17, showing a photosphere and circumstellar disk. The aim is to determine the variability properties of the hot gaseous disks to understand the physical origin of the emission lines and identify dominant physical processes in these disks. We have obtained multiple-epoch (4-5 epochs) VLT/X-shooter spectra of six young stars in M17 covering about a decade. Using stacked spectra we update the spectral classification and identify circumstellar features. With the temporal variance method (TVS) we determine the extent and amplitude of the spectral line variations. The double-peaked emission lines in the PMS stars with gaseous disks are used to determine peak-to-peak velocities, V/R-ratios and the radial velocity of the systems. We identify many disk features, under which a new detection of CO bandhead and CI emission. In three of the stars we detect spectral variability, mainly in lines originating in the circumstellar disk, in a velocity range up to 320 km/s. In two PMS stars the ratio between the blue and red peaks shows a correlation with the peak-to-peak velocity, possibly explained by a spiral-arm structure in the disk. The PMS stars with variability are at similar positions in the HRD but show significant differences in disk lines and variability. The extent and timescale of the variability differs for each star and per line (sets). We find indications for an accretion flow, slow disk winds and/or disk structures in the hot gaseous inner disk as the cause of the variability in these PMS stars.
