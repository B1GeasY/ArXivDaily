 - **Abstract**
 Searches for small exoplanets around solar-type stars are limited by stellar physical variability. While chromospheric variability is well studied, observing, modeling. and understanding the much smaller fluctuations in photospheric spectral line strengths, shapes, and shifts is challenging. Extreme precision radial-velocity spectrometers now enable extreme precision stellar spectroscopy and time series of the Sun seen as a star permit monitoring of its photospheric variability. Fluctuations in their line strengths may well correlate with radial-velocity excursions and identify observable proxies for their monitoring. From three years of HARPS-N observations of the Sun-as-a-star, one thousand low-noise spectra are selected, and line absorption measured in Fe I, Fe II, Mg I, Mn I, H-alpha, H-beta, H-gamma, Na I, and the G-band. Their variations and likely atmospheric origins are examined, also with respect to simultaneously measured chromospheric emission and apparent radial velocity. Systematic line-strength variability is seen, largely shadowing the solar-cycle evolution of Ca II H & K emission, but with smaller amounts, typically on a sub-percent level. Among iron lines, greatest amplitudes are for Fe II in the blue, while the trends change sign among differently strong lines in the green Mg I triplet and between Balmer lines. Variations in the G-band core are greater than of the full G-band, in line with theoretical predictions. No variation is detected in the semi-forbidden Mg I 457.1 nm. Hyperfine split Mn I behaves largely similar to Fe I. For lines at longer wavelengths, telluric absorption limits the achievable precision. Microvariability in the solar photospheric spectrum thus displays systematic signatures among various features. These measure something different than the classical Ca II H & K index while still reflecting a strong influence from magnetic regions.
#### Milky Way-est: Cosmological Zoom-in Simulations with Large Magellanic  Cloud and Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus Analogs

 - **Abstract**
 We present Milky Way-est, a suite of 20 cosmological cold-dark-matter-only zoom-in simulations of Milky Way (MW)-like host halos. Milky Way-est hosts are selected such that they: ($i$) are consistent with the MW's measured halo mass and concentration, ($ii$) accrete a Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)-like ($\approx 10^{11}~M_{\odot}$) subhalo within the last $1.3~\mathrm{Gyr}$ on a realistic orbit, placing them near $50~\mathrm{kpc}$ from the host center at $z\approx 0$, and ($iii$) undergo a $>$1:5 sub-to-host halo mass ratio merger with a Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE)-like system at early times ($0.67<z<3$). Hosts satisfying these LMC and GSE constraints constitute $< 1\%$ of all halos in the MW's mass range, and their total masses grow rapidly at late times due to LMC analog accretion. Compared to hosts of a similar final halo mass that are not selected to include LMC and GSE analogs, Milky Way-est hosts contain $22\%$ more subhalos with present-day virial masses above $10^8~M_{\odot}$ throughout the virial radius, on average. This enhancement reaches $\approx 80\%$ in the inner $100~\mathrm{kpc}$ and is largely, if not entirely, due to LMC-associated subhalos. These systems also induce spatial anisotropy in Milky Way-est subhalo populations, with $\approx 60\%$ of the total subhalo population within $100~\mathrm{kpc}$ found in the current direction of the LMC. Meanwhile, we find that GSE-associated subhalos do not significantly contribute to present-day Milky Way-est subhalo populations. These results provide context for our Galaxy's dark matter structure and subhalo population and will help interpret a range of measurements that are currently only possible in the MW.
#### FORGE'd in FIRE III: The IMF in Quasar Accretion Disks from STARFORGE

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, we demonstrated self-consistent formation of strongly-magnetized quasar accretion disks (QADs) from cosmological radiation-magnetohydrodynamic-thermochemical galaxy-star formation simulations, including the full STARFORGE physics shown previously to produce a reasonable IMF under typical ISM conditions. Here we study star formation and the stellar IMF in QADs, on scales from 100 au to 10 pc from the SMBH. We show it is critical to include physics often previously neglected, including magnetic fields, radiation, and (proto)stellar feedback. Closer to the SMBH, star formation is suppressed, but the (rare) stars that do form exhibit top-heavy IMFs. Stars can form only in special locations (e.g. magnetic field switches) in the outer QAD. Protostars accrete their natal cores rapidly but then dynamically decouple from the gas and 'wander,' ceasing accretion on timescales ~100 yr. Their jets control initial core accretion, but the ejecta are 'swept up' into the larger-scale QAD flow without much dynamical effect. The strong tidal environment strongly suppresses common-core multiplicity. The IMF shape depends sensitively on un-resolved dynamics of protostellar disks (PSDs), as the global dynamical times can become incredibly short (< yr) and tidal fields are incredibly strong, so whether PSDs can efficiently transport angular momentum or fragment catastrophically at <10 au scales requires novel PSD simulations to properly address. Most analytic IMF models and analogies with planet formation in PSDs fail qualitatively to explain the simulation IMFs, though we discuss a couple of viable models.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of young stellar populations in the Large Magellanic Cloud cluster NGC 1783 has caught significant attention, with suggestions ranging from it being a genuine secondary stellar generation to a population of blue straggler stars or simply contamination from background stars. Thanks to multi-epoch observations with the Hubble Space Telescope, proper motions for stars within the field of NGC 1783 have been derived, thus allowing accurate cluster membership determination. Here, we report that the younger stars within NGC 1783 indeed belong to the cluster, and their spatial distribution is more extended compared to the bulk of the older stellar population, consistent with previous studies. Through N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the observed characteristics of the younger stars cannot be explained solely by blue straggler stars in the context of the isolated dynamical evolution of NGC 1783. Instead, accretion of the external, low-mass stellar system can better account for both the inverse spatial concentration and the radial velocity isotropy of the younger stars. We propose that NGC 1783 may have accreted external stars from low-mass stellar systems, resulting in a mixture of external younger stars and blue straggler stars from the older bulk population, thereby accounting for the characteristics of the younger sequence.
#### Revisiting Primordial Black Hole Capture by Neutron Stars

 - **Abstract**
 A sub-solar mass primordial black hole (PBH) passing through a neutron star, can lose enough energy through interactions with the dense stellar medium to become gravitationally bound to the star. Once captured, the PBH would sink to the core of the neutron star, and completely consume it from the inside. In this paper, we improve previous energy-loss calculations by considering a realistic solution for the neutron star interior, and refine the treatment of the interaction dynamics and collapse likelihood. We then consider the effect of a sub-solar PBH population on neutron stars near the Galactic center. We find that it is not possible to explain the lack of observed pulsars near the galactic center through dynamical capture of PBHs, as the velocity dispersion is too high. We then show that future observations of old neutron stars close to Sgr A* could set stringent constraints on the PBHs abundance. These cannot however be extended in the currently unconstrained asteroid-mass range, since PBHs of smaller mass would lose less energy in their interaction with the neutron star and end up in orbits that are too loosely bound and likely to be disrupted by other stars in the Galactic center.
#### Galactic Chemical Evolution Models Favor an Extended Type Ia Supernova  Delay-Time Distribution

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) produce most of the Fe-peak elements in the Universe and therefore are a crucial ingredient in galactic chemical evolution models. SNe Ia do not explode immediately after star formation, and the delay-time distribution (DTD) has not been definitively determined by supernova surveys or theoretical models. Because the DTD also affects the relationship among age, [Fe/H], and [$\alpha$/Fe] in chemical evolution models, comparison with observations of stars in the Milky Way is an important consistency check for any proposed DTD. We implement several popular forms of the DTD in combination with multiple star formation histories for the Milky Way in multi-zone chemical evolution models which include radial stellar migration. We compare our predicted interstellar medium abundance tracks, stellar abundance distributions, and stellar age distributions to the final data release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). We find that the DTD has the largest effect on the [$\alpha$/Fe] distribution: a DTD with more prompt SNe Ia produces a stellar abundance distribution that is skewed toward a lower [$\alpha$/Fe] ratio. While the DTD alone cannot explain the observed bimodality in the [$\alpha$/Fe] distribution, in combination with an appropriate star formation history it affects the goodness of fit between the predicted and observed high-$\alpha$ sequence. Our model results favor an extended DTD with fewer prompt SNe Ia than the fiducial $t^{-1}$ power law.

 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs in ultra-short period orbits around white dwarfs offer a unique opportunity to study the properties of tidally-locked, fast rotating (1-3 hr), and highly-irradiated atmospheres. Here, we present phase-resolved spectrophotometry of the white dwarf-brown dwarf (WD-BD) binary SDSS 1557, which is the fifth WD-BD binary in our six-object sample. Using the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 Near-infrared G141 instrument, the 1.1 to 1.7 $\mu$m phase curves show rotational modulations with semi-amplitudes of 10.5$\pm$0.1%. We observe a wavelength dependent amplitude, with longer wavelengths producing larger amplitudes, while no wavelength dependent phase shifts were identified. The phase-resolved extracted BD spectra exhibit steep slopes and are nearly featureless. A simple radiative energy redistribution atmospheric model recreates the hemisphere integrated brightness temperatures at three distinct phases and finds evidence for weak redistribution efficiency. Our model also predicts a higher inclination than previously published. We find that SDSS 1557B, the second most irradiated BD in our sample, is likely dominated by clouds on the night side, whereas the featureless day side spectrum is likely dominated by H$^-$ opacity and a temperature inversion, much like the other highly-irradiated BD EPIC2122B.

 - **Abstract**
 The MINCE (Measuring at Intermediate metallicity Neutron-Capture Elements) project aims to gather the abundances of neutron-capture elements but also of light elements and iron peak elements in a large sample of giant stars in this metallicity range. T The aim of this work is to study the chemical evolution of galactic sub-components recently identified (i.e. Gaia Sausage Enceladus (GSE), Sequoia). We used high signal-to-noise ratios, high-resolution spectra and standard 1D LTE spectrum synthesis to determine the detailed abundances. We could determine the abundances for up to 10 neutron-capture elements (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm and Eu) in 33 stars. The general trends of abundance ratios [n-capture element/Fe] versus [Fe/H] are in agreement with the results found in the literature. When our sample is divided in sub-groups depending on their kinematics, we found that the run of [Sr/Ba] vs [Ba/H] for the stars belonging to the GSE accretion event shows a tight anti-correlation. The results for the Sequoia stars, although based on a very limited sample, shows a [Sr/Ba] systematically higher than the [Sr/Ba] found in the GSE stars at a given [Ba/H] hinting at a different nucleosynthetic history. Stochastic chemical evolution models have been computed to understand the evolution of the GSE chemical composition of Sr and Ba. The first conclusions are that the GSE chemical evolution is similar to the evolution of a dwarf galaxy with galactic winds and inefficient star formation. Detailed abundances of neutron-capture elements have been measured in high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of intermediate metal-poor stars, the metallicity range covered by the MINCE project. These abundances have been compared to detailed stochastic models of galactic chemical evolution.
#### Great Observatory for Long Wavelengths (GO-LoW) NIAC Phase I Final  Report

 - **Abstract**
 The low-frequency sky below $\sim$15 MHz (20 m) is obscured by the Earth's ionosphere, the layer of charged particles above the neutral atmosphere. Single spacecraft have made measurements in this band, but cannot achieve high or even moderate angular resolution because a telescope's resolution ($\theta$) is set by $\theta = \lambda/D$, where $\lambda$ is the wavelength and $D$ is the telescope diameter. For wavelengths that range from tens of meters to kilometers, a telescope must be hundreds of meters to many kilometers in diameter for even moderate resolution. The Great Observatory for Long Wavelengths (GO-LoW) is an interferometric mega-constellation space telescope operating between 300 kHz and 15 MHz. In a departure from the traditional approach of a single, large, expensive spacecraft (e.g., HST, Chandra, JWST), GO-LoW is an interferometric Great Observatory comprising thousands of small, inexpensive, and reconfigurable nodes. A distributed constellation of sensing elements provides (1) reliability and robustness to failures, (2) longevity by allowing for growth over time and infusion of new technology via staged replacement of nodes, (3) reduced costs through leveraging mass production, and (4) formation reconfigurability to optimize the observatory for diverse science cases. A low-frequency mega-constellation revolutionizes a number of compelling science cases: high-resolution all-sky mapping, Dark Ages/Epoch of Reionization cosmology, interstellar medium mapping, solar/planetary magnetic activity, and exoplanetary magnetospheric radio emission. This report summarizes GO-LoW's concept development under NASA's NIAC Phase I program. We discuss antenna design and sensitivity, constellation architecture, including communication and launch infrastructure, interferometric correlation and a technology roadmap.
#### 21cm signal from Dark Ages collapsing halos with detailed molecular  cooling treatment

 - **Abstract**
 Context. In order to understand the formation of the first stars, which set the transition between the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn epochs, it is necessary to provide a detailed description of the physics at work within the first clouds of gas which, during their gravitational collapse, will set the conditions for stars to be form through the mechanism of thermal instability. Aims. Our objective is to study in detail the molecular cooling of gas in the halos preceding the formation of the first stars. We are furthermore assessing the sensitivity of the 21cm hydrogen line to this cooling channel. Results. We present the CHEMFAST code, that we developed to compute the cosmological 21cm neutral hydrogen line inside collapsing matter overdensity. We precisely track evolution in the abundances of ions, atoms and molecules through a network of chemical reactions. Computing the molecular thermal function due to the excitation of the rotational levels of the H2 molecule, we find it strongly affects the gas temperature inside collapsing clouds of $10^8$ M$_\odot$. The gas temperature falls at the end of the collapse, when the molecular cooling takes over the heating due to gravitation. Conclusions. We find that the 21cm brightness temperature inside the collapsing cloud presents an emission feature, different from the one predicted in expansion scenario. It moreover follows the same behavior as the gas temperature, as it is also strongly affected by the molecular cooling. This makes it a promising probe in order to map the collapsing halos and thermal processes at work inside them.
#### A generalizable method for estimating meteor shower false positives

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The determination of meteor shower or parent body associations is inherently a statistical problem. Traditional methods, primarily the similarity discriminants, have limitations, particularly in handling the increasing volume and complexity of meteoroid orbit data. Aims. We aim to introduce a new, more statistically robust and generalizable method for estimating false positive detections in meteor shower identification, leveraging Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). Methods. Utilizing a dataset of 824 fireballs observed by the European Fireball Network, we apply a multivariate Gaussian kernel within KDE and z-score data normalization. Our method analyzes the parameter space of meteoroid orbits and geocentric impact characteristics, focusing on four different similarity discriminants: DSH, D', DH, and DN. Results. The KDE methodology consistently converges towards a true established shower-associated fireball rate within the EFN dataset of 18-25% for all criteria. This indicates that the approach provides a more statistically robust estimate of the shower-associated component. Conclusions. Our findings highlight the potential of KDE, combined with appropriate data normalization, in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of meteor shower analysis. This method addresses the existing challenges posed by traditional similarity discriminants and offers a versatile solution adaptable to varying datasets and parameters.
#### Exploring the borderline between stable mass transfer and mergers in  close binary evolution

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08615
 - **Abstract**
 The majority of massive stars reside in binary systems, which are expected to experience mass transfer during their evolution. However, so far the conditions under which mass transfer leads to a common envelope, and thus possibly to a merging of both stars, are not well understood. Main uncertainties arise from the possible swelling of the mass gainer, and from angular momentum loss from the binary system, during non-conservative mass transfer. We have computed a dense grid of detailed models of stars accreting mass at constant rates, to determine their radius increase due to their thermal disequilibrium. While we find that models with faster than thermal timescale accretion generally expand, this expansion remains quite limited in the intermediate mass regime even for accretion rates which exceed the thermal timescale accretion rate by a factor of 100. Our models of massive accretion stars expand to extreme radii under those conditions. When the accretion rate exceed the Eddington accretion rate, our models expand dynamically. We have derived analytical fits to the radius evolution of our models and a prescription for the borderline between stable mass transfer and mergers for arbitrary accretion efficiencies. We then apply our results to grids of binary models adopting various constant mass transfer efficiencies and angular momentum budgets. We find that the former parameter has the stronger effect on the outcome of the Roche lobe overflow. Our results are consistent with detailed binary evolution models, and often lead to a smaller initial parameter space for stable mass transfer than other recipes in the literature. We use this method to investigate the origin of the Wolf-Rayet stars with O star companions in the Small Magellanic Cloud, and find that the efficiency of the mass transfer process which lead to the formation of the Wolf-Rayet star was likely below 50%.
#### The role of stochastic Fermi-type particle acceleration in the inner  jets of Active Galactic Nuclei

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08625
 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution radio observations of nearby active galactic nuclei have revealed extended, limb-brightened structures in their inner jets. This ties in with other multi-wavelength observations from radio to X-ray and gamma-ray, indicating that a structured jet model is required. While electrons need to be kept energized to account for the observed features, the underlying particle acceleration mechanism is still unclear. We explore the role of stochastic Fermi-type particle acceleration, i.e., classical second-order Fermi and shear acceleration, for understanding the multi-wavelength observations of the inner jets of M87. An analytical Fokker-Planck description is adopted to infer characteristic spectral indices and cutoff energies for these two mechanisms. We focus on electron synchrotron radiation as the dominant emission process. We find that the multi-wavelength observations of M87 can be satisfactorily accounted for in a framework, where the X-rays are produced at a larger distance from the core than the radio emission region. This provides further support to multi-zone, broadband emission modelling. We use our findings to also comment on the acceleration of cosmic rays entrained in the sheath.
