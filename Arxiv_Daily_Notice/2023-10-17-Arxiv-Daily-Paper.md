 - **Abstract**
 Gas cooling and heating functions play a crucial role in galaxy formation. But, it is computationally expensive to exactly compute these functions in the presence of an incident radiation field. These computations can be greatly sped up by using interpolation tables of pre-computed values, at the expense of making significant and sometimes even unjustified approximations. Here we explore the capacity of machine learning to approximate cooling and heating functions with a generalized radiation field. Specifically, we use the machine learning algorithm XGBoost to predict cooling and heating functions calculated with the photoionization code Cloudy at fixed metallicity, using different combinations of photoionization rates as features. We perform a constrained quadratic fit in metallicity to enable a fair comparison with traditional interpolation methods at arbitrary metallicity. We consider the relative importance of various photoionization rates through both a principal component analysis (PCA) and calculation of SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values for our XGBoost models. We use feature importance information to select different subsets of rates to use in model training. Our XGBoost models outperform a traditional interpolation approach at each fixed metallicity, regardless of feature selection. At arbitrary metallicity, we are able to reduce the frequency of the largest cooling and heating function errors compared to an interpolation table. We find that the primary bottleneck to increasing accuracy lies in accurately capturing the metallicity dependence. This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning methods such as XGBoost to capture the non-linear behavior of cooling and heating functions.

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents the Globular cluster Extra-tidal Mock Star (GEMS) catalogue of extra-tidal stars and binaries created via three-body dynamical encounters in globular cluster cores. Using the particle-spray code Corespray, we sample N=50,000 extra-tidal stars and escaped recoil binaries for 159 Galactic globular clusters. Sky positions, kinematics, stellar properties and escape information are provided for all simulated stars. Stellar orbits are integrated in seven different static and time-varying Milky Way gravitational potential models where the structure of the disc, perturbations from the Large Magellanic Cloud and the mass and sphericity of the Milky Way's dark matter halo are all investigated. We find that the action coordinates of the mock extra-tidal stars are largely Galactic model independent, where minor offsets and broadening of the distributions between models are likely due to interactions with substructure. Importantly, we also report the first evidence for stellar stream contamination by globular cluster core stars and binaries for clusters with pericentre radii larger than five kiloparsecs. Finally, we provide a quantitative tool that uses action coordinates to match field stars to host clusters with probabilities. Ultimately, combining data from the GEMS catalogue with information of observed stars will allow for association of extra-tidal field stars with any Galactic globular cluster; a requisite tool for understanding population-level dynamics and evolution of clusters in the Milky Way.
#### The H-alpha Emission Signature: The Role of Critical Ionization Velocity  in Interstellar Space

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09389
 - **Abstract**
 Gaussian decomposition of HI4PI profiles was done for two regions along high velocity Complex M, the first with corresponding H-alpha emission and the second without. In the former, we detected the Critical Ionization Velocity (CIV) signature, a line width of 25 km/s, of H-alpha. In low-velocity gas, the CIV effect ionizes the atoms and produces the signatures of He (34 km/s), CNO (13.4 km/s), and the metals (around 6 km/s). In anomalous-velocity gas, the CIV effect ionizes the ions and produces the signatures of ionized CNO (20 km/s) and-or H-alpha (25.5 km/s), as well as the CIV signatures of metals around 6 km/s. These distinct CIV signatures indicate that the physical conditions are different in each velocity regime. The particles in the low-velocity gas cloud are initially neutral, the temperatures can be cold (50-100 K), and the abundances can be cosmic. The densities need to be high enough to impose regular recombination. The anomalous-velocity gas, on the other hand, initially contains a significant population of ionized and excited particles. The temperature and abundance values may be similar to those that characterize low-density gas, but the densities must be low enough so that the plasma is essentially collision-less, similar to the conditions in the solar wind.
#### Identification and chemical modelling of phosphorus nitride (PN) towards  the hot molecular cores G10.47+0.03 and G31.41+0.31

 - **Abstract**
 Phosphorus (P) is one of the important elements for the formation of life and plays a crucial role in several biochemical processes. Recent spectral line surveys have confirmed the existence of P-bearing molecules, especially PN and PO, in the star-formation regions, but their formation mechanisms are poorly understood. The P-bearing molecule phosphorus nitride (PN) is detected in several star-forming regions, but this molecule has been poorly studied at high gas densities ($\geq$10$^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$) hot molecular cores. In this article, we present the detection of the rotational emission line of PN with transition J = 3$-$2 towards the hot molecular cores G10.47+0.03 and G31.41+0.31, using the Atacama Compact Array (ACA). The estimated column densities of PN for G10.47+0.03 and G31.41+0.31 using the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model are (3.60$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ and (9.10$\pm$0.1)$\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ with an excitation temperature of 150$\pm$25 K. The fractional abundance of PN relative to H$_{2}$ is 2.76$\times$10$^{-10}$ for G10.47+0.03 and 5.68$\times$10$^{-11}$ for G31.41+0.031. We compute the two-phase warm-up chemical model of PN to understand the chemical evolution in the environment of hot molecular cores. After chemical modelling, we claim that PN is created in the gas phase via the neutral-neutral reaction between PO and N in the warm-up stage. Similarly, PN is destroyed via the ion-neutral reaction between H$_{3}$O$^{+}$ and PN.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we employ a convolutional neural network to classify gravitational waves originating from core-collapse supernovae. Training was conducted using spectrograms derived from three-dimensional numerical simulations of waveforms, which were injected onto real noise data from the third observing run of both Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. To gain insights into the model's decision-making process, we apply class activation mapping techniques to visualize the regions in the input image that are significant for the model's prediction. Our model distinguished between 9 different waveforms and noise with an accuracy of 98.4% at 1 kpc. Visualization through class activation mapping revealed that the model's predictions predominantly rely on specific features within the input spectrograms, namely the g-mode and low-frequency modes.

 - **Abstract**
 As part of the GLOSTAR (GLObal view of STAR formation in the Milky Way) survey, we present the high-resolution continuum source catalog for the regions (l = 2-28, 36-40, 56-60, &|b|<1.0), observed with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in its B-configuration. The continuum images are optimized to detect compact sources on angular scales up to 4", and have a typical noise level of 1sigma ~ 0.08mJy/beam for an angular resolution of 1", which makes GLOSTAR currently the highest resolution as well as the most sensitive radio survey of the northern Galactic plane at 4-8GHz. We extracted 13354 sources above a threshold of 5sigma and 5437 sources above 7sigma that represent the high-reliability catalog. We determined the in-band spectral index (alpha) for the sources in the 7sigma-threshold catalog. The mean value is alpha=-0.6, which indicates that the catalog is dominated by sources emitting non-thermal radio emission. We identified the most common source types detected in radio surveys: 251 HII region candidates (113 new), 282 planetary nebulae (PNe) candidates (127 new), 784 radio star candidates (581 new), and 4080 extragalactic radio source candidates (2175 new). A significant fraction of HII regions and PNe candidates have alpha<-0.1 indicating that these candidates could contain radio jets, winds or outflows from high-mass and low-mass stellar objects. We identified 245 variable radio sources by comparing the flux densities of compact sources from the GLOSTAR survey and the Co-Ordinated Radio `N' Infrared Survey for High-mass star formation (CORNISH), and find that most of them are infrared quiet. The catalog is typically 95% complete for point sources at a flux density of 0.6 mJy (i.e. typical 7sigma level) and the systematic positional uncertainty is <= 0.1".

 - **Abstract**
 The JWST NIRSpec integral field unit (IFU) presents a unique opportunity to observe directly imaged exoplanets from 3-5um at moderate spectral resolution (R~2,700) and thereby better constrain the composition, disequilibrium chemistry, and cloud properties of their atmospheres. In this work, we present the first NIRSpec IFU high-contrast observations of a substellar companion that requires starlight suppression techniques. We develop specific data reduction strategies to study faint companions around bright stars, and assess the performance of NIRSpec at high contrast. First, we demonstrate an approach to forward model the companion signal and the starlight directly in the detector images, which mitigates the effects of NIRSpec's spatial undersampling. We demonstrate a sensitivity to planets that are 2e-6 fainter than their stars at 1'', or 2e-5 at 0.3''. Then, we implement a reference star point spread function (PSF) subtraction and a spectral extraction that does not require spatially and spectrally regularly sampled spectral cubes. This allows us to extract a moderate resolution (R~2,700) spectrum of the faint T-dwarf companion HD~19467~B from 2.9-5.2um with signal-to-noise ratio (S/N)~10 per resolution element. Across this wavelength range, HD~19467~B has a flux ratio varying between 1e-5-1e-4 and a separation relative to its star of 1.6''. A companion paper by Hoch et al. more deeply analyzes the atmospheric properties of this companion based on the extracted spectrum. Using the methods developed here, NIRSpec's sensitivity may enable direct detection and spectral characterization of relatively old (~1Gyr), cool (~250K), and closely separated (~3-5au) exoplanets that are less massive than Jupiter.

 - **Abstract**
 CORSIKA 8 is a new framework for air shower simulations implemented in modern C++17, based on past experience with existing codes like CORSIKA 7. The flexible and modular structure of the project allows the development of independent modules that can produce a fully customizable air shower simulation. The radio module in particular is designed to treat the signal propagation and electric field calculation to each antenna in an autonomous and flexible way. It provides the possibility to simulate simultaneously the radio emission calculated with two independent time-domain formalisms, the "Endpoint formalism" as implemented in CoREAS and the "ZHS" algorithm as ported from ZHAireS. Future development for the simulation of radio emission from particle showers in complex scenarios, for example cross-media showers penetrating from air into ice, can build on the existing radio module, re-using the establishes interfaces. In this work, we will present the design and implementation of the radio module in CORSIKA 8, and show a direct comparison of radio emission from air showers simulated with CORSIKA 8, CORSIKA 7 and ZHAireS.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10100
 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of a $\gamma$-ray bubble spanning at least 100$\rm deg^2$ in ultra high energy (UHE) up to a few PeV in the direction of the star-forming region Cygnus X, implying the presence Super PeVatron(s) accelerating protons to at least 10 PeV. A log-parabola form with the photon index $\Gamma (E) = (2.71 \pm 0.02) + (0.11 \pm 0.02) \times \log_{10} (E/10 \ {\rm TeV})$ is found fitting the gamma-ray energy spectrum of the bubble well. UHE sources, `hot spots' correlated with very massive molecular clouds, and a quasi-spherical amorphous $\gamma$-ray emitter with a sharp central brightening are observed in the bubble. In the core of $\sim 0.5^{\circ}$, spatially associating with a region containing massive OB association (Cygnus OB2) and a microquasar (Cygnus X-3), as well as previously reported multi-TeV sources, an enhanced concentration of UHE $\gamma$-rays are observed with 2 photons at energies above 1 PeV. The general feature of the bubble, the morphology and the energy spectrum, are reasonably reproduced by the assumption of a particle accelerator in the core, continuously injecting protons into the ambient medium.

 - **Abstract**
 We use multiband archival HST observations to measure the photometric and structural parameters of the M81 globular cluster that hosts the Fast Radio Burst FRB 20200120E. Our best-fitting King model has an effective radius $r_h = 3.06$ pc with a moderate King model concentration of $c = 53$, and an inferred core radius of 0.81 pc. We revisit the exact astrometric location of the FRB within the cluster, and find that FRB 20200120E is located 1.92 pc from the center, but within the projected half-light radius. We estimate the relative encounter rate of the FRB host, along with the corresponding rates of 210 other globular clusters in M81, and compare these values with the encounter rates of Galactic globular clusters. The FRB resides in a globular cluster with an encounter rate that is moderately higher than the median stellar encounter rate in our two comparison samples. While the estimated encounter rate of the FRB host cluster (e.g., $\sim50\%$ of a cluster like 47 Tuc) is sufficient to allow the possibility that the FRB formed dynamically, our results do not place strong constraints on this scenario due to the limitations of the available HST data and the possible systematic uncertainties and selection effects in the comparison data.

 - **Abstract**
 To understand the chemistry of sulphur (S) in the interstellar medium, models need to be tested by observations of S-bearing molecules in different physical conditions. We analyse observations obtained with the IRAM 30m telescope towards 15 well-known cores classified in the three main evolutionary stages of the high-mass star-formation process: high-mass starless cores,high-mass protostellar objects, and ultracompact HII regions. We detected rotational lines of SO, SO+, NS, C34S, 13CS, SO2, CCS, H2S, HCS+, OCS, H2CS, and CCCS. We also analyse for the first time lines of the NO molecule to complement the analysis. From a local thermodynamic equilibrium approach, we have derived column densities of each species and excitation temperatures. Based on a statistical analysis on the line widths and the excitation temperatures, we find that: NS, C34S, 13CS, CCS, and HCS+ trace cold, quiescent, and likely extended material; OCS, and SO2 trace warmer, more turbulent, and likely denser and more compact material; SO and perhaps SO+ trace both quiescent and turbulent material depending on the target. The abundances of SO, SO2, and H2S show the strongest positive correlations with the kinetic temperature, believed to be an evolutionary indicator. Moreover, the sum of all molecular abundances show an enhancement of gaseous S from the less evolved to the more evolved stages. These trends could be due to the increasing amount of S sputtered from dust grains owing to the increasing protostellar activity with evolution. The average abundances in each evolutionary group increase especially in the oxygen-bearing molecules, perhaps due to the increasing abundance of atomic oxygen with evolution owing to photodissociation of water in gas phase. Our observational work represents a test-bed for theoretical studies aimed at modelling the chemistry of sulphur during the evolution of high-mass star-forming cores
