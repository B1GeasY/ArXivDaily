#### Non-thermal emission from mildly relativistic dynamical ejecta of  neutron star mergers: spectrum and sky image
 - **Authors:** Gilad Sadeh, Noya Linder, Eli Waxman
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07047
 - **Abstract**
 Binary neutron star mergers are expected to produce fast dynamical ejecta, with mildly relativistic velocities extending to $\beta=v/c>0.6$. In a preceding paper, we derived an analytic description of the time-dependent radio to X-ray synchrotron flux produced by collisionless shocks driven by such fast ejecta into the interstellar medium, for spherical ejecta with broken power-law mass (or energy) distributions, $M(>\gamma\beta)\propto(\gamma\beta)^{-s}$ with $s=s_\text{KN}$ at $\gamma\beta<\gamma_0\beta_0$ and $s=s_\text{ft}$ at $\gamma\beta>\gamma_0\beta_0$ (where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor). Here, we extend our analysis and provide analytic expressions for the self-absorption frequency, the cooling frequency, and the observed angular size of the emitting region (which appears as a ring in the sky). For parameter values characteristic of merger calculation results -- a "shallow" mass distribution, $1<s_\text{KN}<3$, for the bulk of the ejecta (at $\gamma\beta\approx0.2$), and a steep, $s_\text{ft}>5$, "fast tail" mass distribution -- the analytic results reproduce well (to tens of percent accuracy) the results of detailed numeric calculations, a significant improvement over earlier order-of-magnitude estimates (based on extrapolations of results valid for $\gamma\beta\ll1$).

 - **Abstract**
 Fragmentation during the early stages of high-mass star formation is crucial for understanding the formation of high-mass clusters. We investigated fragmentation within thirty-nine high-mass star-forming clumps as part of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Survey of 70 $\mu$m Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES). Considering projection effects, we have estimated core separations for 839 cores identified from the continuum emission and found mean values between 0.08 and 0.32 pc within each clump. We find compatibility of the observed core separations and masses with the thermal Jeans length and mass, respectively. We also present sub-clump structures revealed by the 7 m-array continuum emission. Comparison of the Jeans parameters using clump and sub-clump densities with the separation and masses of gravitationally bound cores suggests that they can be explained by clump fragmentation, implying the simultaneous formation of sub-clumps and cores within rather than a step-by-step hierarchical fragmentation. The number of cores in each clump positively correlates with the clump surface density and the number expected from the thermal Jeans fragmentation. We also find that the higher the fraction of protostellar cores, the larger the dynamic range of the core mass, implying that the cores are growing in mass as the clump evolves. The ASHES sample exhibits various fragmentation patterns: aligned, scattered, clustered, and sub-clustered. Using the Q-parameter, which can help to distinguish between centrally condensed and subclustered spatial core distributions, we finally find that in the early evolutionary stages of high-mass star formation, cores tend to follow a subclustered distribution.
#### H2CO and CS in diffuse clouds: Excitation and abundance
 - **Authors:** Maryvonne Gerin, Harvey Liszt, Jerome Pety, Alexandre Faure

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07075
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07075
 - **Abstract**
 To provide constraints on the chemical processes responsible for the observed columns of organic species, we used NOEMA to observe the sight line toward NRAO150 in the 2mm spectral window. We targeted the low excitation lines of o-H2CO 2(1,1)-1(1,0) and p-H2CO 2(0,2)-1(0,1) as well as the nearby transitions of CS(3-2) and c-C3H2. We combined these data with previous observations to determine the excitation conditions, column densities, and abundances relative to H2 in the different velocity components. We performed non-LTE radiative transfer calculations including collision cross sections with ortho and para H2 and with electrons. New collision cross sections with electrons were computed for ortho and para formaldehyde. The c-C3H2 line profiles are very similar to those of HCO+ and CCH, while the CS absorption features are narrower and mostly concentrated in two main velocity components at V = -17 and -10 km/s. H2CO absorption lines present an intermediate pattern with absorption in all velocity components but larger opacities in the two main velocity components. The ortho-to-para ratios of H2CO and c-C3H2 are consistent with the statistical value of 3. While the excitation temperature of all c-C3H2 velocity components is consistent with the CMB, the two strong components detected in CS show a clear excess over the CMB indicating that CS resides at higher densities than other species along this particular sightline, n(H2) ~ 2500 cm-3 while n(H2) < 500 cm-3 for the other velocity components. We detected faint absorption from o-H213CO and C34S allowing us to derive isotopic ratios: o-H2CO/o-H213CO = 61 and C32S/C34S = 24. The excitation of the 4.8GHz line of formaldehyde is sensitive to the electron fraction and its excitation temperature is predicted to be lower than the CMB at low and moderate electron fractions, x(e)< 6E-5, and to rise above the CMB at high electron fractions, > 1e-4.
#### HST Survey of the Orion Nebula Cluster in ACS/Visible and WFC3/IR Bands.  IV. A Bayesian multicolor study of stellar parameters in the ONC

 - **Abstract**
 We have performed a comprehensive study of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) combining the photometric data obtained by the two \textit{HST} Treasury programs that targeted this region. To consistently analyze the rich dataset obtained in a wide variety of filters, we adopted a Bayesian approach to fit the Spectral Energy Distribution of the sources, deriving mass, age, extinction, distance, and accretion for each source in the region. The three dimensional study of mass distribution for bona-fide cluster members shows that mass segregation in the ONC extends to sub-solar masses, while the age distribution strongly supports the idea that star formation in the ONC is best described by a major episode of star formation that happened $\sim 1$ Myr ago. For masses $\gtrsim 0.1$ \Msun, our derived empirical initial mass function (IMF) is in good agreement with a Chabrier system IMF. Both the accretion luminosity (\Lacc) and mass accretion rates (\dMacc) are best described by broken power-law relations. This suggests that for the majority of young circumstellar disks in this cluster the excess emission may be dominated by X-ray-driven photoevaporation by the central star rather than external photoevaporation. If this is the case, the slopes of the power-law relations may be largely determined by the initial conditions set at the onset of the star formation process, which may be quite similar between regions that eventually form clusters of different sizes.

 - **Abstract**
 Be X-ray binaries (Be-XRBs) are crucial in understanding high-mass X-ray binaries, featuring a rapidly rotating Be star and a neutron star companion in an eccentric orbit, intermittently accreting material from the Be star's decretion disk. Originating from binary stellar evolution, Be-XRBs are of significant interest to binary population synthesis (BPS) studies, encapsulating the physics of supernovae, common envelope, and mass transfer (MT). Using the POSYDON BPS code, employing pre-computed grids of detailed binary stellar evolution models, we investigate the Galactic Be-XRB population. POSYDON incorporates stellar rotation self-consistently during MT phases, enabling a detailed examination of the rotational distribution of Be stars. Our fiducial BPS and Be-XRB model align well with the orbital properties of Galactic Be-XRBs, emphasizing the role of rotational constraints. Our modeling reveals a bimodal rotational distribution of Be-XRB-like systems, in excellent agreement with literature values. All Be-XRBs undergo an MT phase before the first compact object forms, with over half experiencing a second MT phase from a stripped helium companion (Case BB). Computing rotationally-limited MT efficiencies and applying them to our population, we find that the majority of Be-XRBs have undergone highly non-conservative MT (beta ~ 0.15). Our study underscores the importance of detailed angular momentum modeling during MT in interpreting Be-XRB populations, emphasizing this population as a key probe for the stability and efficiency of MT in interacting binaries.
#### Observations of spiral and streamer on a candidate proto-brown dwarf

 - **Abstract**
 Spirals and streamers are the hallmarks of mass accretion during the early stages of star formation. We present the first observations of a large-scale spiral and a streamer towards a very young brown dwarf candidate in its early formation stages. These observations show, for the first time, the influence of external environment that results in asymmetric mass accretion via feeding filaments onto a candidate proto-brown dwarf in the making. The impact of the streamer has produced emission in warm carbon-chain species close to the candidate proto-brown dwarf. Two contrasting scenarios, a pseudo-disk twisted by core rotation and the collision of dense cores, can both explain these structures. The former argues for the presence of a strong magnetic field in brown dwarf formation while the latter suggests that a minimal magnetic field allows large-scale spirals and clumps to form far from the candidate proto-brown dwarf.
#### Identifying a point-symmetric morphology in supernova remnant Cassiopeia  A: explosion by jittering jets

 - **Abstract**
 We identify a point-symmetric morphology of the supernova remnant (SNR) Cassiopeia A compatible with shaping by at least two, and more likely more than four, pairs of opposite jets, as expected in the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of core-collapse supernovae. Using an old X-ray map of argon, we identify seven pairs of opposite morphological features that we connect with lines that cross each other at the same point on the plane of the sky. The opposite morphological features include protrusions, clumps, filaments, and funnels in the main SNR shell. In addition to these seven symmetry axes, we find two tentative symmetry axes (lines). These lines form a point-symmetric wind-rose. We place this point-symmetric wind-rose on a new JWST and X-ray images of Cassiopeia A. We find other morphological features and one more symmetry axis that strengthen the identified point-symmetric morphology. Not all symmetry axes correspond to jets; e.g., some clumps are formed by the compression of ejecta between two jet-inflated lobes (bubbles). The robust point-symmetric morphology in the iconic Cassiopeia A SNR strongly supports the JJEM and poses a severe challenge to the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 iCOMs are species commonly found in the interstellar medium. They are believed to be crucial seed species for the build-up of chemical complexity in star forming regions as well as our own Solar System. Thus, understanding how their abundances evolve during the star formation process and whether it enriches the emerging planetary system is of paramount importance. We use data from the ALMA Large Program FAUST to study the compact line emission towards the [BHB2007] 11 proto-binary system (sources A and B), where a complex structure of filaments connecting the two sources with a larger circumbinary disk has previously been detected. More than 45 CH3OCHO lines are clearly detected, as well as 8 CH3OCH3 transitions , 1 H2CCO transition and 4 t-HCOOH transitions. We compute the abundance ratios with respect to CH3OH for CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3, H2CCO, t-HCOOH (as well as an upper limit for CH3CHO) through a radiative transfer analysis. We also report the upper limits on the column densities of nitrogen bearing iCOMs, N(C2H5CN) and N(C2H3CN). The emission from the detected iCOMs and their precursors is compact and encompasses both protostars, which are separated by only 0.2" (~ 28 au). The integrated intensities tend to align with the Southern filament, revealed by the high spatial resolution observations of the dust emission at 1.3 mm. A PV and 2D analysis are performed on the strongest and uncontaminated CH3OCH3 transition and show three different spatial and velocity regions, two of them being close to 11B (Southern filament) and the third one near 11A. All our observations suggest that the detected methanol, as well as the other iCOMs, are generated by the shocked gas from the incoming filaments streaming towards [BHB2007] 11A and 11B, respectively, making this source one of the few where chemical enrichment of the gas caused by the streaming material is observed.
#### Fragmentation of Dense Rotation-Dominated Structures Fed by Collapsing  Gravomagneto-Sheetlets and Origin of Misaligned 100 au-Scale Binaries and  Multiple Systems

 - **Abstract**
 The majority of stars are in binary/multiple systems. How such systems form in turbulent, magnetized cores of molecular clouds in the presence of non-ideal MHD effects remains relatively under-explored. Through ATHENA++-based non-ideal MHD AMR simulations with ambipolar diffusion, we show that the collapsing protostellar envelope is dominated by dense gravomagneto-sheetlets, a turbulence-warped version of the classic pseuodisk produced by anisotropic magnetic resistance to the gravitational collapse, in agreement with previous simulations of turbulent, magnetized single-star formation. The sheetlets feed mass, magnetic fields, and angular momentum to a Dense ROtation-Dominated (DROD) structure, which fragments into binary/multiple systems. This DROD fragmentation scenario is a more dynamic variant of the traditional disk fragmentation scenario for binary/multiple formation, with dense spiral filaments created by inhomogeneous feeding from the highly structured larger-scale sheetlets rather than the need for angular momentum transport, which is dominated by magnetic braking. Collisions between the dense spiraling filaments play a key role in pushing the local magnetic Toomre parameter $Q_\mathrm{m}$ below unity, leading to gravitational collapse and stellar companion formation provided that the local material is sufficiently demagnetized, with a plasma-$\beta$ of order unity or more. This mechanism can naturally produce {\it in situ} misaligned systems on the 100-au scale, often detected with high-resolution ALMA observations. Our simulations also highlight the importance of non-ideal MHD effects, which affect whether fragmentation occurs and, if so, the masses and orbital parameters of the stellar companions formed.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanet transmission spectra provide rich information about the chemical composition, clouds and temperature structure of exoplanet atmospheres. Most exoplanet transmission spectra only span infrared wavelengths ($\gtrsim$ 1 $\rm{\mu m}$), which can preclude crucial atmospheric information from shorter wavelengths. Here, we explore how retrieved atmospheric parameters from exoplanet transmission spectra change with the addition of optical data. From a sample of 14 giant planets with transit spectra from 0.3-4.5 $\rm{\mu m}$, primarily from the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes, we apply a free chemistry retrieval to planetary spectra for wavelength ranges of 0.3-4.5 $\rm{\mu m}$, 0.6-4.5 $\rm{\mu m}$, and 1.1-4.5 $\rm{\mu m}$. We analyse the posterior distributions of these retrievals and perform an information content analysis, finding wavelengths below 0.6 $\rm{\mu m}$ are necessary to constrain cloud scattering slope parameters ($\log{a}$ and $\gamma$) and alkali species Na and K. There is limited improvement in the constraints on the remaining atmospheric parameters. Across the population, we find limb temperatures are retrieved colder than planetary equilibrium temperatures but have an overall good agreement with Global Circulation Models. As JWST extends to a minimum wavelength of 0.6 $\rm{\mu m}$, we demonstrate that exploration into complementing JWST observations with optical HST data is important to further our understanding of aerosol properties and alkali abundances in exoplanet atmospheres.
