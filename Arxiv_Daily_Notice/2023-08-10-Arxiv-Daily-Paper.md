 - **Abstract**
 As one of the closest supernovae (SNe) in the last decade, SN 2023ixf is an unprecedented target to investigate the progenitor star that exploded. However, there is still significant uncertainty in the reported progenitor properties. In this work, we present a detailed study of the progenitor of SN 2023ixf with two independent analyses. We first modelled its spectral energy distribution (SED) based on Hubble Space Telescope optical, Spitzer mid-infrared (IR), and ground-based near-IR data. We find that stellar pulsation and circumstellar extinction have great impacts on SED fitting, and the result suggests a relatively massive red supergiant (RSG) surrounded by C-rich dust with an initial mass of 16.2--17.4 Msun. The corresponding mass-loss rate estimate is 1e-5 Msun/yr. We also derived the star formation history of the SN environment based on resolved stellar populations, and the most recent star-forming epoch corresponds to a progenitor initial mass of 17--19 Msun, in agreement with that from our SED fitting. Therefore, we conclude that the progenitor of SN 2023ixf is close to the high-mass end for Type II SN progenitors.
#### 3-D SPH simulations of the FUOR flares in the clumpy accretion model

 - **Abstract**
 One of the early hypotheses about the origin of FUOR outbursts explains them by the fall of gas clumps from the remnants of protostellar clouds onto protoplanetary disks surrounding young stars (Hartmann and Kenyon 1985). To calculate the consequences of such an event we make 3D hydrodynamic simulations by SPH method. It is shown that the fall of the clump on the disk in the vicinity of the star actually causes a burst of the star's accretion activity, resembling in its characteristics the flares of known FUORs. In the region of incidence, an inhomogeneous gas ring is formed, which is inclined relative to the outer disk. During several revolutions around the star, this ring combines with the inner disk and forms a tilted disk. In the process of evolution, the inner disk expands, and its inclination relative to the outer disk decreases. After 100 revolutions, the angle of inclination is a few degrees. This result is of interest in connection with the discovery in recent years of protoplanetary disks, the inner region of which is inclined relative to the outer one. Such structures are usually associated with the existence in the vicinity of a star of a massive body (planet or brown dwarf), whose orbit is inclined relative to the plane of the disk. The results of our modeling indicate the possibility of an alternative explanation for this phenomenon.
#### The Accretion Mode in Sub-Eddington Supermassive Black Holes: Getting  into the Central Parsecs of Andromeda

 - **Abstract**
 The inner kiloparsec regions surrounding sub-Eddington (luminosity less than 10$^{-3}$ in Eddington units, L$_{Edd}$) supermassive black holes (BHs) often show a characteristic network of dust filaments that terminate in a nuclear spiral in the central parsecs. Here we study the role and fate of these filaments in one of the least accreting BHs known, M31 (10$^{-7}$ L$_{Edd}$) using hydrodynamical simulations. The evolution of a streamer of gas particles moving under the barred potential of M31 is followed from kiloparsec distance to the central parsecs. After an exploratory study of initial conditions, a compelling fit to the observed dust/ionized gas morphologies and line-of-sight velocities in the inner hundreds of parsecs is produced. After several million years of streamer evolution, during which friction, thermal dissipation, and self-collisions have taken place, the gas settles into a disk tens of parsecs wide. This is fed by numerous filaments that arise from an outer circumnuclear ring and spiral toward the center. The final configuration is tightly constrained by a critical input mass in the streamer of several 10$^3$ M$_{\odot}$ (at an injection rate of 10$^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$); values above or below this lead to filament fragmentation or dispersion respectively, which are not observed. The creation of a hot gas atmosphere in the region of $\sim$10$^6$ K is key to the development of a nuclear spiral during the simulation. The final inflow rate at 1pc from the center is $\sim$1.7 $\times$ 10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, consistent with the quiescent state of the M31 BH.
#### Tidal Response and Shape of Hot Jupiters

 - **Abstract**
 We study the response of hot Jupiters to a static tidal perturbation using the Concentric MacLaurin Spheroid (CMS) method. For strongly irradiated planets, we first performed radiative transfer calculations to relate the planet's equilibrium temperature, T_eq, to its interior entropy. We then determined the gravity harmonics, shape, moment of inertia, and the static Love numbers for a range of two-layer interior models that assume a rocky core plus a homogeneous and isentropic envelope composed of hydrogen, helium, and heavier elements. We identify general trends and then study HAT-P-13b, the WASP planets 4b, 12b, 18b, 103b, and 121b, as well as Kepler-75b and CoRot-3b. We compute the Love numbers, k_nm, and transit radius correction, Delta R, which we compare with predictions in the literature. We find that the Love number, k_22, of tidally locked giant planets cannot exceed the value 0.6, and that the high T_eq consistent with strongly irradiated hot Jupiters tend %lead to further lower k_22. While most tidally locked planets are well described by a linear-regime response of k_22 = 3 J_2/q_0 (where q_0 is the rotation parameter of the gravitational potential), for extreme cases such as WASP-12b, WASP-103b and WASP-121b, nonlinear effects can account for over 10% of the predicted k_22. k_22 values larger than 0.6, as they have been reported for planets WASP-4b and HAT-P13B, cannot result from a static tidal response without extremely rapid rotation, and thus are inconsistent with their expected tidally-locked state.
#### Study of Jupiter's Interior with Quadratic Monte Carlo Simulations

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.05008
 - **Abstract**
 We construct models for Jupiter's interior that match the gravity data obtained by the Juno and Galileo spacecrafts. To generate ensembles of models, we introduce a novel quadratic Monte Carlo technique that is more efficient in confining fitness landscapes than affine invariant method that relies on linear stretch moves. We compare how long it takes the ensembles of walkers in both methods to travel to the most relevant parameter region. Once there, we compare the autocorrelation time and error bars of the two methods. For a ring potential and the 2d Rosenbrock function, we find that our quadratic Monte Carlo technique is significantly more efficient. Furthermore we modified the walk moves by adding a scaling factor. We provide the source code and examples so that this method can be applied elsewhere. Here we employ our method to generate five-layer models for Jupiter's interior that include winds and a prominent dilute core, which allows us to match the planet's even and odd gravity harmonics. We compare predictions from the different model ensembles and analyze how much an increase of the temperature at 1 bar and ad hoc change to the equation of state affects the inferred amount of heavy elements in atmosphere and in the planet overall.
#### Deuterium Escape on Sub-Neptunes

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of deuterium to hydrogen mass ratio (D/H) driven by EUV photoevaporation of hydrogen-rich atmospheres of close-in sub-Neptunes around solar-type stars. For the first time, the diffusion-limited approach in conjunction with energy-limited photoevaporation is considered in evaluating deuterium escape from evolving exoplanet H/He envelopes. We find that the planets with smaller initial gas envelopes and thus smaller sizes can lead to weaker atmospheric escape, which facilitates hydrogen-deuterium fractionation. Specifically, in our grid of simulations with a low envelope mass fraction less than 0.005, a low-mass sub-Neptune (4-$5M_\oplus$) at about 0.25-0.4 au or a high-mass sub-Neptune (10-$15M_\oplus$) at about 0.1-0.25 au can increase the D/H values by greater than 20% over 7.5 Gyrs. Akin to the helium-enhanced envelopes of sub-Neptunes due to photoevaporating escape, the planets along the upper boundary of the radius valley are the best targets to detect high D/H ratios. The ratio can rise by a factor of $\lesssim$ 1.65 within 7.5 Gyrs in our grid of evolutionary calculations. D/H is expected to be higher in thinner envelopes so long as the planets do not become bare rocky cores.
