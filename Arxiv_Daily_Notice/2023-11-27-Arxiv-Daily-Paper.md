 - **Abstract**
 The shell of the classical nova V5668 Sgr was resolved by ALMA at the frequency of 230 GHz 927 days after eruption, showing that most of the continuum bremsstrahlung emission originates in clumps with diameter smaller than $10^{15}$ cm. Using VLA radio observations, obtained between days 2 and 1744 after eruption, at frequencies between 1 and 35 GHz, we modeled the nova spectra, assuming first that the shell is formed by a fixed number of identical clumps, and afterwards with the clumps having a power law distribution of sizes, and were able to obtain the clump's physical parameters (radius, density and temperature). We found that the density of the clumps decreases linearly with the increase of the shell's volume, which is compatible with the existence of a second media, hotter and thinner, in pressure equilibrium with the clumps. We show that this thinner media could be responsible for the emission of the hard X-rays observed at the early times of the nova eruption, and that the clump's temperature evolution follows that of the super-soft X-ray luminosity. We propose that the clumps were formed in the radiative shock produced by the collision of the fast wind of the white dwarf after eruption, with the slower velocity of the thermonuclear ejecta. From the total mass of the clumps, the observed expansion velocity and thermonuclear explosion models, we obtained an approximate value of 1.25 M$_{\odot}$ for the mass of the white dwarf, a central temperature of $10^7$ K and an accretion rate from the secondary star of $10^{-9}-10^{-8}$ M$_{\odot}$ y$^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We report observations of the ground state transitions of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO C$^{18}$O, HCN, and HCO$^+$ at 88-115 GHz in the inner region of the nearby galaxy IC 342. These data were obtained with the 16-pixel spectroscopic focal plane array Argus on the 100-m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) at 6-9$^{\prime\prime}$ resolution. In the nuclear bar region, the intensity distributions of $^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{13}$CO(1-0) emission trace moderate densities, and differ from the dense gas distributions sampled in C$^{18}$O(1-0), HCN(1-0), and HCO$^+$(1-0). We observe a constant HCN(1-0)-to-HCO$^+$(1-0) ratio of 1.2$\pm$0.1 across the whole $\sim$1 kpc bar. This indicates that HCN(1-0) and HCO$^+$(1-0) lines have intermediate optical depth, and that the corresponding $n_{\textrm{H}_2}$ of the gas producing the emission is of 10$^{4.5-6}$ cm$^{-3}$. We show that HCO$^+$(1-0) is thermalized and HCN(1-0) is close to thermalization. The very tight correlation between HCN(1-0) and HCO$^+$(1-0) intensities across the 1~kpc bar suggests that this ratio is more sensitive to the relative abundance of the two species than to the gas density. We confirm the angular offset ($\sim$10$^{\prime\prime}$) between the spatial distribution of molecular gas and the star formation sites. Finally, we find a breakdown of the $L_\textrm{IR}$-$L_\textrm{HCN}$ correlation at high spatial resolution due to the effect of incomplete sampling of star-forming regions by HCN emission in IC 342. The scatter of the $L_\textrm{IR}$-$L_\textrm{HCN}$ relation decreases as the spatial scale increases from 10$^{\prime\prime}$~to 30$^{\prime\prime}$ (170-510~pc), and is comparable to the scatter of the global relation at the scale of 340 pc.

 - **Abstract**
 Interactions of cosmic ray protons and nuclei in their sources and in the interstellar medium produce "hadronic" gamma-ray emission. Gamma-rays can also be of "leptonic" origin, i.e. originating from high-energy electrons accelerated together with protons. It is difficult to distinguish between hadronic and leptonic emission mechanisms based on gamma-ray data alone. This can be done via detection of neutrinos, because only hadronic processes lead to neutrino production. We use publicly available ten-year IceCube neutrino telescope dataset to demonstrate the hadronic nature of high-energy emission from the direction of Cygnus region of the Milky Way. We find a 3-sigma excess of neutrino events from an extended Cygnus Cocoon, with the flux comparable to the flux of gamma-rays in the multi-TeV energy range seen by HAWC and LHAASO telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of interstellar material infalling onto star- and planet-forming systems have become increasingly common thanks to recent advancements in radio interferometry. These structures replenish disks with fresh material, have the potential to significantly alter their dynamics, trigger the formation of substructures, induce shocks, and modify their physical and chemical properties. In this study, we combine new ALMA band 3 and archival band 6 observations to characterize the dust content and mass infall rate of a 4,000 au arc-like structure infalling onto M512, a class I young stellar object located in the Lynds 1641 region of the Orion A molecular cloud. We measure for the first time spectral index maps and derive a dust opacity index profile along a streamer, constraining grain properties and its dust mass. We measure a spectral index $\alpha \sim$ 3.2 across the entire structure, and a dust opacity index $\beta \sim$ 1.6. Given grain properties consistent with the measured $\beta$, the structure can host up to 245 M$_{\oplus}$ of dust, being comparable or even exceeding the mass of the inner, unresolved 600 au, which contains the protoplanetary disk of M512. Such a massive streamer can strongly affect the evolution of the star- and planet-forming inner system. Assuming typical ISM dust-to-gas ratio of 1%, free-fall timescales (50 kyr) imply total mass infall rates up to 1.5 $\cdot$ 10$^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$/yr. M512 has been classified as an outbursting source with multi-epoch photometry, thus representing an interesting case study to explore the possible connection between infalling streamers and accretion outbursts.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the correlation between intensities of the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO ($J=1$-0) lines toward the Galactic giant molecular clouds (GMCs) W51A, W33, N35-N36 complex, W49A, M17SW, G12.02-00.03, W43, and M16 using the FUGIN (FOREST Unbiased Galactic plane Imaging survey with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope) CO line data. All the GMCs show intensity saturation in the $^{12}$CO line when the brightness temperature of $^{13}$CO is higher than a threshold temperature of about $\sim 5$ K. We obtained high-resolution ($\sim 20"$) distribution maps of the $X_{\rm CO}$ factor ($X_{\rm CO, iso}$) in individual GMCs using correlation diagrams of the CO isotopologues. It is shown that $X_{\rm CO, iso}$ is variable in each GMC within the range of $X_{\rm CO, iso} \sim (0.9 {\rm -} 5) \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1})^{-1}$. Despite the variability in the GMCs, the average value among the GMCs is found to be nearly constant at $X_{\rm CO, iso} = (2.17 \pm 0.27) \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1})^{-1}$, which is consistent with that from previous studies in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the role of optical absorbers is critical for linking the properties of the day-side and terminator atmospheres of hot Jupiters. This study aims to identify the signatures of optical absorbers in the atmosphere of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-41b. We conducted five transit observations of this planet to obtain its optical transmission spectra using the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). We performed atmospheric retrievals assuming free abundances of 12 chemical species. Our Bayesian model comparisons revealed strong evidence for TiO absorption ($\Delta\ln \mathcal{Z}=21.02$), modest evidence for CrH ($\Delta\ln \mathcal{Z}=3.73$), and weak evidence for MgH ($\Delta\ln \mathcal{Z}=2.32$). When we combined the GTC transmission spectrum with previously published Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Spitzer data, the retrieval results and model inferences remained consistent. In conclusion, HAT-P-41b has a metal-rich atmosphere with no high-altitude clouds or hazes. Further observations of its day-side atmosphere should be made to confirm the hints of a thermal inversion in the upper atmosphere suggested by our results.

 - **Abstract**
 We assert that non-linear features of fast neutrino-flavor conversion (FFC) can be qualitatively different between core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs). This argument arises from recent global FFC simulations in BNSM, in which fast flavor swap (FFS) emerges in very narrow spatial regions, whereas neutrinos in CCSN tend to evolve towards flavor equipartition. In this {\it Letter}, we provide the physical mechanism of FFS based on a colliding neutrino beam model. Neutrinos/antineutrinos can undergo FFS when they propagate in ambient neutrino gas that propagates in the opposite direction and also has the opposite sign of ELN-XLN, where ELN and XLN denote electron- and heavy-leptonic neutrino number, respectively. Such environments can be naturally realized in BNSMs, whereas they are unlikely in CCSNe unless the neutrino sphere is strongly deformed aspherically. Our study exhibits the diversity of non-linear dynamics of FFC.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present the detection of twelve doublets with quantum numbers of N=12-11 to N=17-16 of the v11 vibrationally excited state of C6H towards TMC-1. This marks the first time that an excited vibrational state of a molecule has been detected in a cold starless core. The data are part of the QUIJOTE line survey gathered with the Yebes 40m radio telescope. The line intensities have been aptly reproduced with a rotational temperature of 6.2 +/- 0.4K and a column density of (1.2+/-0.2)e11 cm-2. We also analysed the ground state transitions of C6H, detecting fourteen lines with quantum numbers of J = 23/2-21/2 to J = 35/2 for each of the two 2Pi_3/2 and 2Pi_1/2 ladders. It is not possible to model the intensities of all the transitions of the ground state simultaneously using a single column density. We considered the two ladders as two different species and found that the rotational temperature is the same for both ladders, Trot(2Pi_3/2)=Trot(2Pi_1/2)=6.2+/-0.2, achieving a result that is comparable to that of the v11 state. The derived column densities are N(2Pi_3/2)(6.2+/-0.3)e12cm-2 and N(2Pi_1/2)=(8.0+/-0.4)e10cm-2. The fraction of C6H molecules in its 2Pi_3/2, 2Pi_1/2, and v11 states is 96.8 %, 1.3 %, and 1.9 %, respectively. Finally, we report that this vibrational mode has also been detected towards the cold cores Lupus-1A and L1495B, as well as the low-mass star forming cores L1527 and L483, with fractions of C6H molecules in this mode of 3.8%, 4.1%, 14.8%, and 6%, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Cloud cover plays a pivotal role in assessing observational conditions for astronomical site-testing. Except for the fraction of observing time, its fragmentation also wields a significant influence on the quality of nighttime sky clarity. In this article, we introduce the function Gamma, designed to comprehensively capture both the fraction of available observing time and its continuity. Leveraging in situ measurement data gathered at the Muztagh-ata site between 2017 and 2021, we showcase the effectiveness of our approach. The statistical result illustrates that the Muztagh-ata site affords approximately 122 nights of absolute clear and 205 very good nights annually, corresponding to Gamma greater than or equal 0.9 and Gamma greater than or equal 0.36 respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 As gravitational wave detectors improve, observations of black hole (BH) mergers will provide the joint distribution of their masses and spins. This will be a critical benchmark to validate formation scenarios. Merging binary BHs formed through isolated binary evolution require both components to be stripped of their hydrogen envelopes before core-collapse. The rotation rates of such stripped stars are constrained by their surface critical rotation, restricting their angular momentum content at core-collapse. We use stripped star models at low metallicities ($Z_\odot/10$, $Z_\odot/50$ and $Z_\odot/250$) to determine the spins of BHs produced by critically rotating stellar progenitors. To study how such progenitors can arise, we consider their formation through chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE). We use a semianalytical model to study the final spins of CHE binaries, and compare our results against available detailed population synthesis models. We find that above BH masses of $\simeq 25M_\odot$, the dimensionless spin of critically rotating stripped stars ($a = Jc/(GM^2$)) is below unity. This results in an exclusion region at high chirp masses and effective spins that cannot be populated by binary evolution. CHE can produce binaries where both BHs hit this limit, producing a pile-up at the boundary of the excluded region. Highly spinning BHs arise from very low-metallicity CHE systems with short delay times, which merge at higher redshifts. On the other hand, the contribution of CHE to merging binary BHs in the third observing run of the LVK collaboration is expected to be dominated by systems with low spins ($\chi_\mathrm{eff}<0.5$) which merge near redshift zero. Owing to its higher projected sensitivity and runtime, the fourth observing run of the LVK collaboration can potentially place constraints on the high spin population and the existence of a limit set by critical rotation.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection and mitigation is critical for enabling and maximising the scientific output of radio telescopes. The emergence of machine learning methods capable of handling large datasets has led to their application in radio astronomy, particularly in RFI detection. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by biological systems, are well-suited for processing spatio-temporal data. This study introduces the first application of SNNs to an astronomical data-processing task, specifically RFI detection. We adapt the nearest-latent-neighbours (NLN) algorithm and auto-encoder architecture proposed by previous authors to SNN execution by direct ANN2SNN conversion, enabling simplified downstream RFI detection by sampling the naturally varying latent space from the internal spiking neurons. We evaluate performance with the simulated HERA telescope and hand-labelled LOFAR dataset that the original authors provided. We additionally evaluate performance with a new MeerKAT-inspired simulation dataset. This dataset focuses on satellite-based RFI, an increasingly important class of RFI and is, therefore, an additional contribution. Our SNN approach remains competitive with the original NLN algorithm and AOFlagger in AUROC, AUPRC and F1 scores for the HERA dataset but exhibits difficulty in the LOFAR and MeerKAT datasets. However, our method maintains this performance while completely removing the compute and memory-intense latent sampling step found in NLN. This work demonstrates the viability of SNNs as a promising avenue for machine-learning-based RFI detection in radio telescopes by establishing a minimal performance baseline on traditional and nascent satellite-based RFI sources and is the first work to our knowledge to apply SNNs in astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 How massive stars end their lives depends on the core mass, core angular momentum, and hydrogen envelopes at death. However, these key physical facets of stellar evolution can be severely affected by binary interactions. In turn, the effectiveness of binary interactions itself varies greatly depending on the initial conditions of the binaries, making the situation much more complex. We investigate systematically how binary interactions influence core-collapse progenitors and their fates. Binary evolution simulations are performed to survey the parameter space of supernova progenitors in solar metallicity binary systems and to delineate major evolutionary paths. We first study fixed binary mass ratios ($q=M_2/M_1$ = 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) to elucidate the impacts of initial mass and initial separation on the outcomes, treating separately Type Ibc supernova, Type II supernova, accretion induced collapse (AIC), rapidly rotating supernova (RSN), black hole formation, and gamma ray burst (GRB). We then conduct Binary Population Synthesis calculations for 12 models, varying the initial parameter distributions and binary evolution parameters, to estimate various supernova fractions. We obtain a Milky Way supernova rate $R_{\rm SN} = (1.14$--$1.57) \times10^{-2} \, {\rm yr}^{-1}$ which is consistent with observations. We find the rates of AIC, RSN, and GRB to be $\sim 1/100$ the rate of regular supernovae. Our estimated GRB rates are higher than the observed long GRB rate, but very close to the low luminosity GRB rate. Furthering binary modeling and improving the inputs one by one will enable more detailed studies of these and other transients associated with massive stars.

 Shock breakout emission is light that arises when a shockwave, generated by core-collapse explosion of a massive star, passes through its outer envelope. Hitherto, the earliest detection of such a signal was at several hours after the explosion, though a few others had been reported. The temporal evolution of early light curves should reveal insights into the shock propagation, including explosion asymmetry and environment in the vicinity, but this has been hampered by the lack of multiwavelength observations. Here we report the instant multiband observations of a type II supernova (SN 2023ixf) in the galaxy M101 (at a distance of 6.85+/-0.15 Mpc), beginning at about 1.4 hours after the explosion. The exploding star was a red supergiant with a radius of 450 solar radii. The light curves evolved rapidly, on timescales of 1-2 hours, and appeared unusually fainter and redder than predicted by models within the first few hours, which we attribute to an optically thick dust shell before it was disrupted by the shockwave. We infer that the breakout and perhaps the distribution of the surrounding dust were not spherically symmetric.

 - **Abstract**
 Close binary central stars of planetary nebulae (PNe) must have formed through a common envelope evolution during the giant phase experienced by one of the stars. Transfer of the angular momentum from the binary system to the envelope leads to the shortening of the binary separations from the radius of red giant to the radius of the order of few tenths of AU. Thus, close binary central stars of planetary nebulae are laboratories to study the common envelope phase of evolution. The close binary fraction in the Galaxy has been measured in various sky surveys, but the close binary fraction is not yet well constrained for the Magellanic Clouds, and our results may help the study of common envelope evolution in low-metallicity environments. This paper presents a continuation of our study of variability in the Magellanic Cloud planetary nebulae on the basis of data from the OGLE survey. Previously, we had analysed the OGLE data in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Here, the study is extended to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). In this paper we search for close binary central stars with the aim to constrain the binary fraction and period distribution in the LMC. We identified 290 counterparts of PNe in the LMC in the I-band images from the OGLE-III and OGLE-IV surveys. However, the light curves of ten objects were not accessible in the OGLE database, and thus we analysed the time series photometry of 280 PNe. In total, 32 variables were found, but 5 of them turned out to be foreground objects. Another 18 objects show irregular or regular variability that is not attributable to the binarity of their central stars. Their status and the nature of their variability will be verified in the follow-up paper. Nine binary central stars of PNe with periods between 0.24 and 23.6 days were discovered. The obtained fraction for the LMC PNe is 3.3^(+2.6)_(-1.6)% without correcting for incompleteness.
