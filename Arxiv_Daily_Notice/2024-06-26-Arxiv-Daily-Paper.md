#### The Relation Between Variances of a 3D Density and Its 2D Column Density Revisited
 - **Authors:** Heesun Yoon, Jungyeon Cho

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the relation between the variance of three-dimensional (3D) density ($\sigma^{2}_{\rho}$) and that of the projected two-dimensional (2D) column density ($\sigma^{2}_{\Sigma}$) in turbulent media, which is of great importance in obtaining turbulence properties from observations. Earlier studies showed that $\sigma^{2}_{\Sigma / \Sigma_{0}}/\sigma^{2}_{\rho / \rho_{0}} = \mathcal{R}$, where $\Sigma/\Sigma_0$ and $\rho/\rho_0$ are 2D column and 3D volume densities normalized by their mean values, respectively. The factor $\mathcal{R}$ depends only on the density spectrum for isotropic turbulence in a cloud that has similar dimensions along and perpendicular to the line of sight. Our major findings in this paper are as follows. First, we show that the factor $\mathcal{R}$ can be expressed in terms of $N$, the number of independent eddies along the line of sight. To be specific, $\sigma^{2}_{\Sigma / \Sigma_{0}}/\sigma^{2}_{\rho/\rho_{0}}$ is proportional to $\sim 1/N$, due to the averaging effect arising from independent eddies along the line of sight. Second, we show that the factor $\mathcal{R}$ needs to be modified if the dimension of the cloud in the line-of-sight direction is different from that in the perpendicular direction. However, if we express $\sigma^{2}_{\Sigma / \Sigma_{0}}/\sigma^{2}_{\rho / \rho_{0}}$ in terms of $N$, the expression remains same even in the case the cloud has different dimensions along and perpendicular to the line of sight. Third, when we plot $N\sigma^{2}_{\Sigma / \Sigma_{0}}$ against $\sigma^{2}_{\rho / \rho_{0}}$, two quantities roughly lie on a single curve regardless of the sonic Mach number, which implies that we can directly obtain the latter from the former. We discuss observational implications of our findings.

 - **Abstract**
 With the number of supernovae observed expected to drastically increase thanks to large-scale surveys like the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), it is necessary that the tools we use to classify these objects keep up with this increase. We previously created Supernova Tagging and Classification (STag) to address this problem by employing machine learning techniques alongside logistic regression in order to assign 'tags' to spectra based on spectral features. STag II is a continuation of this work, which now makes use of model supernova spectra combined with real DESI spectra in order to train STag to better deal with realistic data. We also make use of the rlap score as a trustworthiness cut, making for a more robust and accurate supernova classifier than before.

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical spectroscopy of 710 solar neighborhood stars collected over twenty years to catalog chromospheric activity and search for stellar activity cycles. The California Legacy Survey stars are amenable to exoplanet detection using precise radial velocities, and we present their Ca II H and K time series as a proxy for stellar and chromospheric activity. Using the HIRES spectrometer at Keck Observatory, we measured stellar flux in the cores of the Ca II H and K lines to determine S-values on the Mt. Wilson scale and the log(R'HK) metric, which is comparable across a wide range of spectral types. From the 710 stars, with 52,372 observations, 285 stars are sufficiently sampled to search for stellar activity cycles with periods of 2-25 years, and 138 stars show stellar cycles of varying length and amplitude. S-values can be used to mitigate stellar activity in the detection and characterization of exoplanets. We use them to probe stellar dynamos and to place the Sun's magnetic activity into context among solar neighborhood stars. Using precise stellar parameters and time-averaged activity measurements, we find tightly constrained cycle periods as a function of stellar temperature between log(R'HK) of -4.7 and -4.9, a range of activity in which nearly every star has a periodic cycle. These observations present the largest sample of spectroscopically determined stellar activity cycles to date.
#### Two Dynamically Discovered Compact Object Candidate Binary Systems from LAMOST Low-resolution Survey

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.17340

 - **Abstract**
 We report two binary systems, LAMOST J035540+381550 (hereafter J035540) and LAMOST J035916+400732 (hereafter J035916), identified through the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) low-resolution survey (LRS). Each of these two systems contains an M-type star orbiting with a invisible compact object candidate. Follow-up spectroscopic observations of Palomar 200-inch telescope (P200) enhance radial velocity measurements. We use radial velocities from LAMOST and P200, as well as light curves from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to constrain orbital parameters. The masses of the visible M-type stars are estimated by fitting the MIST isochrones and SEDs. The mass functions for the unseen companions are: $0.22\pm 0.01 M_{\odot}$ for J035540 and $0.16\pm 0.01 M_{\odot}$ for J035916. With the orbital and stellar parameters derived above and assuming the orbital inclination is 90 degree (edge-on), we find that the minimum masses of the invisible companions exceeds that of the visible stars. The single-lined feature and the dynamical evidence suggest the presence of compact objects. J035540's ZTF light curve, modeled with PHOEBE, yields a compact object mass of $0.70^{+0.12}_{-0.05} M_{\odot}$. For J035916, ellipsoidal modulation analysis constrains the light curve amplitude, yielding a compact object mass range of $0.57-0.90 M_{\odot}$. The mass estimates indicate that both are likely white dwarfs. These findings underscore the efficiency of optical time-domain surveys and dynamical methods in identifying faint, massive white dwarfs, along with other compact objects in binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 We present proper motion (PM) measurements for a sample of 23 massive star clusters within the Large Magellanic Cloud using multi-epoch data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We combined archival data from the ACS/WFC and WFC3/UVIS instruments with observations from a dedicated HST programme, resulting in time baselines between 4.7 and 18.2 yr available for PM determinations. For bright well-measured stars, we achieved nominal PM precisions of 55 $\mu$as/yr down to 11 $\mu$as/yr . To demonstrate the potential and limitations of our PM data set, we analysed the cluster NGC 1850 and showcase a selection of different science applications. The precision of the PM measurements allows us to disentangle the kinematics of the various stellar populations that are present in the HST field. The cluster has a centre-of-mass motion that is different from the surrounding old field stars and also differs from the mean motion of a close-by group of very young stars. We determined the velocity dispersion of field stars to be 0.128 +/- 0.003 mas/yr (corresponding to 30.3 +/- 0.7 km/s). The velocity dispersion of the cluster inferred from the PM data set most probably overestimates the true value, suggesting that the precision of the measurements at this stage is not sufficient for a reliable analysis of the internal kinematics of extra-galactic star clusters. Finally, we exploit the PM-cleaned catalogue of likely cluster members to determine any radial segregation between fast and slowly-rotating stars, finding that the former are more centrally concentrated. With this paper, we also release the astro-photometric catalogues for each cluster.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.17367

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the chemical evolution of complex organic molecules (COMs) in turbulent disks using gas-ice chemical reaction network simulations. We trace trajectories of dust particles considering advection, turbulent diffusion, gas drag, and vertical settling, for 10$^6$ yrs in a protoplanetary disk. Then, we solve a gas-ice chemical reaction network along the trajectories and obtain the temporal evolution of molecular abundances. We find that the COM abundances in particles can differ by more than two orders of magnitude even when the UV fluence (i.e., the time integral of UV flux) received by the particles are similar, suggesting that not only the UV fluence but also the time variation of the UV flux does matter for the evolution of COMs in disks. The impact of UV fluence on molecular abundances differs between oxygen-bearing and nitrogen-bearing COMs. While higher UV fluence results in oxygen being locked into CO$_2$, leading to reduced abundances of oxygen-bearing COMs such as CH$_3$OCH$_3$, mild UV exposure can promote their formation by supplying the precursor radicals. On the other hand, nitrogen is not locked up into specific molecules, allowing the formation of nitrogen-bearing COMs, particularly CH$_3$NH$_2$, even for the particle that receives the higher UV fluence. We also find that the final COM abundances are mostly determined by the inherited abundances from the protostellar core when the UV fluence received by dust particles is less than a critical value, while they are set by both the inherited abundances and the chemistry inside the disk at higher UV fluence.

 - **Abstract**
 We implement a local model for a spherical collapsing/expanding gas cloud into the Athena++ magnetohydrodynamic code. This local model consists of a Cartesian periodic box with time-dependent geometry. We present a series of benchmark test problems, including non-linear solutions and linear perturbations of the local model, confirming the code's desired performance. During a spherical collapse, a horizontal shear flow is amplified, corresponding to angular momentum conservation of zonal flows in the global problem; wave speed and amplitude of sound waves increase in the local frame, due to the reduction in the characteristic length scale of the box, which can lead to an anisotropic effective sound speed in the local box. Our code conserves both mass and momentum to machine precision. This numerical implementation of the local model has potential applications to the study of local physics and hydrodynamic instabilities during protostellar collapse, providing a powerful framework for better understanding the earliest stages of star and planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 CO$_2$ is a major component of the icy mantles surrounding dust grains in planet and star formation regions. Understanding its photodesorption is crucial for explaining gas phase abundances in the coldest environments of the interstellar medium irradiated by vacuum-UV (VUV) photons. Photodesorption yields determined experimentally from CO$_2$ samples grown at low temperatures (T=15~K) have been found to be very sensitive to experimental methods and conditions. Several mechanisms have been suggested for explaining the desorption of CO$_2$, O$_2$ and CO from CO$_2$ ices. In the present study, the cross sections characterizing the dynamics of photodesorption as a function of photon fluence (determined from released molecules in the gas phase) and of ice composition modification (determined in situ in the solid phase) are compared for the first time for different photon flux conditions (from 7.3$\times 10^{12}$~photon/s/cm$^2$ to 2.2$\times 10^{14}$~photon/s/cm$^2$) using monochromatic synchrotron radiation in the VUV range (on the DESIRS beamline at SOLEIL). This approach reveals that CO and O$_2$ desorption are decorrelated from that of CO$_2$. CO and O$_2$ photodesorption yields depend on photon flux conditions and can be linked to surface chemistry. By contrast, the phodesorption yield of CO$_2$ is independent of the photon flux conditions and can be linked to bulk ice chemical modification, consistently with an indirect desorption induced by electronic transition (DIET) process.

 - **Abstract**
 On the route towards merging neutron stars and stripped-envelope supernovae, binary population synthesis predicts a large number of post-interaction systems with massive stars that have stripped off their outer layers. Yet, observations of such stars in the intermediate-mass regime below the Wolf-Rayet masses are rare. Using X-Shooting ULLYSES (XShootU) data, we discovered three partially stripped star + Be/Oe binaries in the Magellanic Clouds. We analyzed the UV and optical spectra using the PoWR model atmosphere code by superimposing model spectra corresponding to each component. The estimated current masses of the partially stripped stars fall within the intermediate mass range of 4-8 $M_{\odot}$. These objects are overluminous for their stellar masses, matching core He-burning luminosities. Their Be/Oe secondaries have much higher masses than their stripped primaries (mass ratio > 2). All three partially stripped stars show significant nitrogen enrichment and carbon and oxygen depletion on their surfaces. Additionally, one of our sample stars exhibits significant helium enrichment. Our study provides the first comprehensive determination of the wind parameters of partially stripped stars in the intermediate mass range. The wind mass-loss rates of these stars are found to be on the order of $10^{-7} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, which is over ten times higher than that of OB stars of the same luminosity. Current evolutionary models characterizing this phase typically employ OB or WR mass-loss rates, which underestimate or overestimate stripped stars' mass-loss rates by an order of magnitude. Binary evolution models indicate that the observed primaries had initial masses of 12-17 $M_{\odot}$, making them potential candidates for stripped-envelope supernovae that form neutron stars. If they survive the explosion, these systems may become Be X-ray binaries and later double neutron stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The neutrino signal from the next galactic core-collapse supernova will provide an invaluable early warning of the explosion. By combining the burst trigger from several neutrino detectors, the location of the explosion can be triangulated minutes to hours before the optical emission becomes visible, while also reducing the rate of false-positive triggers. To enable multi-messenger follow-up of nearby supernovae, the SuperNova Early Warning System 2.0 (SNEWS 2.0) will produce a combined alert using a global network of neutrino detectors. This paper describes the trigger publishing and alert formation framework of the SNEWS 2.0 network. The framework is built on the HOPSKOTCH publish-subscribe system to easily incorporate new detectors into the network, and it implements a coincidence system to form alerts and estimate a false-positive rate for the combined triggers. The paper outlines the structure of the SNEWS 2.0 software and the initial testing of coincident signals.
#### The compact circumstellar material of SN 2024ggi: Another supernova with a pre-explosion effervescent zone and jet-driven explosion

 - **Abstract**
 I examine recent theoretical studies and observations of the recent core-collapse supernova (CCSN) SN 20224ggi and find that the likely explanation for its dense, compact circumstellar material is an effervescent model, where parcels or streams of gas are uplifted by stellar convection and pulsation and fall back. The effervescent zone exists alongside the regular wind from the red supergiant (RSG) progenitor of SN 2024ggi. I find that an extended wind-acceleration zone encounters some difficulties in accounting for the required CSM mass. Recent modelling finds the explosion energy of SN 2024ggi to be >1e51 erg and up to 2e51 erg. I examine this explosion energy against a recent study of the delayed neutrino explosion mechanism and find that this mechanism has difficulties in accounting for the required energy. This suggests that the explosion was caused by the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM), adding to other recent pieces of evidence supporting the JJEM, particularly point-symmetric CCSN remnants.
