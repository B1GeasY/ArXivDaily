 - **Abstract**
 Obtaining spectroscopic observations of the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae is often unfeasible due to an inherent lack of knowledge as to which stars will go supernova and when they will explode. In this letter, we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the progenitor activity of SN 2023fyq in the preceding 150 days before the He-rich progenitor exploded as a Type Ibn supernova. The progenitor of SN 2023fyq shows an exponential rise in flux prior to core-collapse. Complex He I emission line features are observed, with a P-Cygni like profile, as well as an evolving broad base with velocities on the order of 10,000 km/s, possibly due to electron scattering. The luminosity and evolution of SN 2023fyq are consistent with a faint Type Ibn, reaching a peak r-band magnitude of 18.1 mag, although there is some uncertainty in the distance to the host, NGC 4388, located in the Virgo cluster. We present additional evidence of asymmetric He-rich material being present prior to the explosion of SN 2023fyq, as well as after, suggesting this material has survived the ejecta-CSM interaction. Broad [O I] and the Ca II triplet lines are observed at late phases, confirming that SN 2023fyq was a genuine supernova rather than a non-terminal interacting transient. SN 2023fyq provides insight into the final moments of a massive star's life, highlighting that the progenitor is likely highly unstable before core-collapse.

 - **Abstract**
 $\omega$ Centauri is considered the most massive globular cluster of the Milky Way and likely the former nuclear star cluster of a galaxy accreted by the Milky Way. It is speculated to contain an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) from several dynamical models. However, uncertainties regarding the location of the cluster center or the retention of stellar remnants limit the robustness of the IMBH detections reported so far. In this paper, we derive and study the stellar kinematics from the highest-resolution spectroscopic data yet, using the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) in the narrow field mode (NFM) and wide field mode (WFM). Our exceptional data near the center reveal for the first time that stars within the inner 20" ($\sim$0.5 pc) counter-rotate relative to the bulk rotation of the cluster. Using this dataset, we measure the rotation and line-of-sight velocity dispersion (LOSVD) profile out to 120$''$ with different centers proposed in the literature. We find that the velocity dispersion profiles using different centers match well with those previously published. Based on the counter--rotation, we determine a kinematic center and look for any signs of an IMBH using the high-velocity stars close to the center. We do not find any significant outliers $>$60 km/s within the central 20$''$, consistent with no IMBH being present at the center of $\omega$ Centauri. A detailed analysis of Jeans' modeling of the putative IMBH will be presented in the next paper of the series.

 - **Abstract**
 Isotopologue ratios are anticipated to be one of the most promising signs of life that can be observed remotely. On Earth, carbon isotopes have been used for decades as evidence of modern and early metabolic processes. In fact, carbon isotopes may be the oldest evidence for life on Earth, though there are alternative geological processes that can lead to the same magnitude of fractionation. However, using isotopologues as biosignature gases in exoplanet atmospheres presents several challenges. Most significantly, we will only have limited knowledge of the underlying abiotic carbon reservoir of an exoplanet. Atmospheric carbon isotope ratios will thus have to be compared against the local interstellar medium or, better yet, their host star. A further substantial complication is the limited precision of remote atmospheric measurements using spectroscopy. The various metabolic processes which cause isotope fractionation cause less fractionation than anticipated measurement precision (biological fractionation is typically 2 to 7%). While this level of precision is easily reachable in the laboratory or with special in situ instruments, it is out of reach of current telescope technology to measure isotope ratios for terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres. Thus, gas isotopologues are poor biosignatures for exoplanets given our current and foreseeable technological limitations.

 - **Abstract**
 High mass-loss rates of red supergiants (RSGs) drastically affect their evolution and final fate, yet their mass-loss mechanism remains poorly understood. Various empirical prescriptions scaled with luminosity have been derived in the literature, yielding results with a dispersion of 2-3 orders of magnitude. We aim to determine an accurate mass-loss rate relation with luminosity and other parameters using a large, clean sample of RSGs and explain the discrepancy between previous works. We assembled a sample of 2,219 RSG candidates in the Large Magellanic Cloud, with ultraviolet to mid-infrared photometry in up to 49 filters. We determined the luminosity of each RSG by integrating the spectral energy distribution and the mass-loss rate using the radiative transfer code DUSTY. Our derived RSG mass-loss rates range from $10^{-9} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ to $10^{-5} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, depending mainly on the luminosity. The average mass-loss rate is $9.3\times 10^{-7} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for $\log{(L/L_\odot)}>4$. We established a mass-loss rate relation as a function of the luminosity and the effective temperature. Furthermore, we found a turning point in the mass-loss rate versus luminosity relation at approximately $\log{(L/L_\odot)} = 4.4$, indicating enhanced rates beyond this limit. We show that this enhancement correlates with photometric variability. Moreover, we compare our results with prescriptions from the literature, finding an agreement with those assuming steady-state winds. Additionally, we examine the effect of different assumptions on our models and found that radiatively driven winds result in higher mass loss rates by 2-3 orders of magnitude, which are unrealistically high for RSGs. Finally, we found 21% of our sample to constitute current binary candidates with a minor effect on our mass-loss relation.
#### The Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey. III.  $\texttt{BTSbot}$: Automated Identification and Follow-up of Bright  Transients with Deep Learning

 - **Abstract**
 The Bright Transient Survey (BTS) aims to obtain a classification spectrum for all bright ($m_\mathrm{peak}\,\leq\,18.5\,$mag) extragalactic transients found in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) public survey. BTS critically relies on visual inspection ("scanning") to select targets for spectroscopic follow-up, which, while effective, has required a significant time investment over the past $\sim5$ yr of ZTF operations. We present $\texttt{BTSbot}$, a multi-modal convolutional neural network, which provides a bright transient score to individual ZTF detections using their image data and 25 extracted features. $\texttt{BTSbot}$ is able to eliminate the need for daily human scanning by automatically identifying and requesting spectroscopic follow-up observations of new bright transient candidates. $\texttt{BTSbot}$ recovers all bright transients in our test split and performs on par with scanners in terms of identification speed (on average, $\sim$1 hour quicker than scanners). We also find that $\texttt{BTSbot}$ is not significantly impacted by any data shift by comparing performance across a concealed test split and a sample of very recent BTS candidates. $\texttt{BTSbot}$ has been integrated into Fritz and $\texttt{Kowalski}$, ZTF's first-party marshal and alert broker, and now sends automatic spectroscopic follow-up requests for the new transients it identifies. During the month of October 2023, $\texttt{BTSbot}$ selected 296 sources in real-time, 93% of which were real extragalactic transients. With $\texttt{BTSbot}$ and other automation tools, the BTS workflow has produced the first fully automatic end-to-end discovery and classification of a transient, representing a significant reduction in the human-time needed to scan. Future development has tremendous potential for creating similar models to identify and request follow-up observations for specific types of transients.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-dimensional nature of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) leads to asymmetric matter ejection and neutrino emission, that potentially accounts for the origin of neutron star (NS) kick. Asymmetric neutrino radiation fields are, in general, accompanied by large-scale inhomogeneous fluid distributions, in particular for electron-fraction ($Y_e$) distributions. Recently, it has also been revealed that lower $Y_e$ environments in proto-neutron star envelope can offer preferable conditions for collective neutrino oscillations. In this paper, we show that a dipole asymmetry of fast neutrino-flavor conversion (FFC), one of the collective neutrino oscillation modes, can power a NS kick, and that it would generate a characteristic correlation between asymmetric distributions of heavy elements in the ejecta and the direction of NS kick. We strengthen our argument for the FFC-driven NS kick mechanism by performing axisymmetric neutrino transport simulations with full Boltzmann neutrino transport. We show that this mechanism can generate sufficient linear momentum of neutrinos to account for typical proper motions of NS. Although more detailed studies are necessary, the present study opens a new channel to give a natal NS kick.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15247
 - **Abstract**
 Approximating neutrino oscillations as subgrid physics is an appealing prospect for simulators of core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star mergers. Because flavor instabilities quickly lead to quasisteady states in oscillation calculations, it is widely believed that flavor mixing can be approximated in astrophysical simulations by mapping unstable states onto the appropriate asymptotic ones. Subgrid models of this kind, however, are not self-consistent. The miscidynamic theory of quantum-coherent gases furnishes a subgrid model that is.

 - **Abstract**
 Jupiter Trojans (JTs) librate about the Lagrangian stationary centers L4 and L5 associated with this planet on a typically small-eccentricity and moderate-inclination heliocentric orbits. The physical and orbital properties of JTs provide important clues about the dynamical evolution of the giant planets in the early Solar System, as well as populations of planetesimals in their source regions. Here we use decade long observations from the Catalina Sky Survey (station G96) to determine the bias-corrected orbital and magnitude distributions of JTs. We distinguish the background JT population, filling smoothly the long-term stable orbital zone about L4 and L5 points, and collisional families. We find that the cumulative magnitude distribution of JTs (the background population in our case) has a steep slope for $H\leq 9$, followed with a moderately shallow slope till $H\simeq 14.5$, beyond which the distribution becomes even shallower. At $H=15$ we find a local power-law exponent $0.38\pm 0.01$. We confirm the asymmetry between the magnitude limited background populations in L4 and L5 clouds characterized by a ratio $1.45\pm 0.05$ for $H<15$. Our analysis suggests an asymmetry in the inclination distribution of JTs, with the L4 population being tighter and the L5 population being broader. We also provide a new catalog of the synthetic proper elements for JTs with an updated identification of statistically robust families (9 at L4, and 4 at L5). The previously known Ennomos family is found to consist of two, overlapping Deiphobus and Ennomos families.
#### Muted Features in the JWST NIRISS Transmission Spectrum of Hot-Neptune  LTT 9779 b

 - **Abstract**
 The hot-Neptune desert is one of the most sparsely populated regions of the exoplanet parameter space, and atmosphere observations of its few residents can provide insights into how such planets have managed to survive in such an inhospitable environment. Here, we present transmission observations of LTT 9779 b, the only known hot-Neptune to have retained a significant H/He-dominated atmosphere, taken with JWST NIRISS/SOSS. The 0.6-2.85$\mu$m transmission spectrum shows evidence for muted spectral features, rejecting a perfectly flat line at >5$\sigma$. We explore water and methane-dominated atmosphere scenarios for LTT 9779 b's terminator, and retrieval analyses reveal a continuum of potential combinations of metallicity and cloudiness. Through comparisons to previous population synthesis works and our own interior structure modelling, we are able to constrain LTT 9779 b's atmosphere metallicity to 20-850x solar. Within this range of metallicity, our retrieval analyses prefer solutions with clouds at mbar pressures, regardless of whether the atmosphere is water- or methane-dominated -- though cloud-free atmospheres with metallicities >500x solar cannot be entirely ruled out. By comparing self-consistent atmosphere temperature profiles with cloud condensation curves, we find that silicate clouds can readily condense in the terminator region of LTT 9779 b. Advection of these clouds onto the day-side could explain the high day-side albedo previously inferred for this planet and be part of a feedback loop aiding the survival of LTT 9779 b's atmosphere in the hot-Neptune desert.

 - **Abstract**
 The Nuclear Stellar Disk has been a highly active star-forming region in the Milky Way for approximately the last 30 million years. Despite hosting prominent clusters like Arches, Quintuplet, and Nuclear Stellar, their combined mass is less than 10% of the expected stellar mass, leading to the "missing cluster problem." Various factors, including high stellar density and tidal forces, contribute to this absence of clusters. Traces of dissolving clusters may exist as co-moving groups of stars, shedding light on the region's star formation history. Our analysis, utilizing integral field spectroscopy and astrophotometric data, reveals a group of young stellar objects in the NSD sharing velocities and positions, potentially indicating remnants of dissolved clusters or stellar associations. This finding contributes valuable insights into the understanding of the missing clusters problem in the Galactic center.
#### On the formation of compact-object binaries from binary-driven  hypernovae

 - **Abstract**
 We present smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of the binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) scenario of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), focusing on the binary stability during the supernova (SN) explosion. The BdHN progenitor is a binary comprised of a carbon-oxygen (CO) star and a neutron star (NS) companion. The core collapse of the CO leads to an SN explosion and a newborn NS ($\nu$NS) at its center. Ejected material accretes onto the NS and the $\nu$NS. BdHNe of type I have compact orbits of a few minutes, the NS reaches the critical mass, forming a black hole (BH), and the energy release is $\gtrsim 10^{52}$ erg. BdHNe II have longer periods of tens of minutes to hours; the NS becomes more massive, remains stable, and the system releases $\sim 10^{50}$-$10^{52}$ erg. BdHN III have longer periods, even days, where the accretion is negligible, and the energy released is $\lesssim 10^{50}$ erg. We assess whether the system remains gravitationally bound after the SN explosion, leading to an NS-BH in BdHN I, an NS-NS in BdHN II and III, or if the SN explosion disrupts the system. The existence of bound systems predicts an evolutionary connection between the long and short GRB populations. We determine the binary parameters for which the binary remains bound after the BdHN event. For these binaries, we derive fitting formulas of the numerical results for the main parameters, e.g., the mass loss, the SN explosion energy, orbital period, eccentricity, center-of-mass velocity, and the relation between the initial and final binary parameters, which are useful for outlined astrophysical applications.
#### Limitations of the modified blackbody fit method for determining  molecular cloud properties

 - **Abstract**
 Achieving a comprehensive understanding of the star and planet formation process is one of the fundamental tasks of astrophysics, requiring detailed knowledge of the physical conditions during the different phases of this process. During the earliest stages, i.e., concerning physical processes in molecular clouds and filaments, the column density N(H2), dust temperature T and dust emissivity index \b{eta} of these objects can be derived by adopting a modified blackbody fit of the far-infrared to (sub-)millimeter spectral energy distributions. However, this often applied method is based on various assumptions. In addition, the observational basis and required, but only assumed cloud properties, such as a limited wavelength-coverage of the spectral energy distribution and dust properties, respectively, may differ between different studies. We review the basic limitations of this method and evaluate their impact on the derived physical properties of the objects of interest, i.e., molecular clouds and filaments. We find that the highest uncertainty when applying this method is introduced by the often poorly constrained dust properties. Therefore, we propose to first derive the optical depth and subsequently the column density with the help of a suitable dust model as the optical depth can be obtained with high accuracy, especially at longer wavelengths. The method provides reliable results up to the high densities and corresponding optical depths observed in molecular clouds. Considering typically used observational data, i.e., measurements obtained with far-infrared instruments like Herschel/PACS, JCMT/SCUBA-2 and SOFIA/HAWC+, data at four wavelengths are sufficient to obtain accurate results. Furthermore, we find that the dust emissivity index \b{eta} derived with this method is not suitable as an indicator of dust grain size.

 - **Abstract**
 The precise definition of the lower mass limit of red supergiant stars (RSGs) is an open question in astrophysics and does not attract too much attention. Here we assemble a spectroscopic evolved cool star sample with 6,602 targets, including RSGs, asymptotic giant branch stars, and red giant branch stars, in the Large Magellanic Cloud based on \textit{Gaia} DR3 and SDSS-IV/APOGEE-2. The reference spectrum of each stellar population is built according to the quantile range of relative intensity ($1\%\sim99\%$). Five different methods, e.g., chi-square ($\chi^2$), cosine similarity (CS), machine learning (ML), equivalent width (EW), and line ratio (LR), are used in order to separate different stellar populations. The ML and $\chi^2$ provide the best and relatively consistent prediction of certain population. The derived lower limit of the RSG population is able to reach to the $\rm K_S$-band tip of red giant branch ($\rm K_S~$$\approx12.0$ mag), indicating a luminosity as low as about $10^{3.5}~L_{\sun}$, which corresponds to a stellar radius only about $100~R_{\sun}$. Given the mass-luminosity relation of $L/L_\sun =f(M/M_\sun)^3$ with $f\approx15.5\pm3$ and taking into account of the mass loss of faint RSGs up to now, the minimal initial mass of the RSG population would be about $6.1\pm0.4~M_\sun$, which is much lower than the traditional threshold of $8~M_\sun$ for the massive stars. This is the first spectroscopic evidence, indicating that the lower mass limit of RSG population is around $6~M_\sun$. However, the destinies of such faint RSGs are still elusive and may have large impact on the stellar evolutionary and supernova models.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we report our multi-angle observations of the transverse oscillation of a prominence and a filament induced by an EUV wave originating from the farside of the Sun on 2014 September 1. The prominence oscillation was simultaneously observed by both Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft and Extreme-UltraViolet Imager (EUVI) onboard the Behind Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft. The speed of the shock travelling in the interplanetary space exceeds that of the EUV wave, and the coronal dimming area experiences minimal growth. This indicates that the shock wave is driven by the CME, while the EUV wave freely propagates after the lateral motion of the CME flanks has stopped. The observed oscillation direction of the prominence, determined through three-dimensional reconstruction, further supports this point. Moreover, The detailed investigation of the oscillations in the prominence and filament induced by the EUV wave reveals initial amplitudes of 16.08 and 2.15 Mm, periods of 1769 and 1863 s, damping time scales of 2640 and 1259 s, and damping ratios of 1.49 and 0.68, respectively. The radial component of magnetic field, as derived from the prominence and filament oscillation measurements, was estimated to be 5.4 G and 4.1 G, respectively. In turn, utilizing the onset times of both the prominence and filament oscillation, the average speeds of the EUV wave are determined to be 498 km s$^{-1}$ and 451 km s$^{-1}$, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Most old supernova remnants (SNRs) in the Milky Way have not yet been identified. Considering their large potential number and the sufficient momentum-energy transfer to the interstellar medium (ISM), they are a key part of our understanding of the overall role of SNRs in the ISM. Here we report our discovery of an expanding molecular shell identified by CO line observations, namely G16.11-0.51. It covers a known SNR, specifically G16.0-0.5, and is larger in size, i.e. 0.56 deg over 0.20 deg. Based on its spatial and kinematic structures, weak nonthermal radio-continuum emission, and derived physical properties, we suggest that it is an old SNR. At a systemic velocity of +41.3 km s^-1, the best estimated kinematic distance of G16.11-0.51 is ~3.2 kpc, implying its radius of about 15.6 pc. The age of G16.11-0.51 is estimated to be greater than ~10^5 yr, and, in a dense molecular environment, it has formed dense and thin shell layers. The kinetic energy of the expanding molecular gas of G16.11-0.51 is about 6.4x10^49 erg, accounting for approximately six percent of the initial SN explosion energy. Although old SNRs have essentially become cold and hard to detect, our discovery suggests that they can be found by searching for CO line emissions.

 - **Abstract**
 The equilibrium resulting in a recombining plasma with arbitrary metallicity Z, heated by a mean radiation field E as well as by sound waves dissipation due to thermal conduction, dynamic and bulk viscosity is analyzed. Generally, the heating by acoustic waves dissipation induces drastic changes in the range of temperature where the thermochemical equilibrium may exist. An additional equilibrium state appears which is characterized by a lower ionization and higher gas pressure than the equilibrium resulting when the wave dissipation is neglected. The above effects are sensibly to the values of the gas parameters as well as the wavelength and intensity of the acoustic waves. Implications in the interstellar gas, in particular, in the high velocity clouds are outlined.
#### Transport-driven super-Jeans fragmentation in dynamical star-forming  regions

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16083
 - **Abstract**
 The Jeans criterion is one cornerstone in our understanding of gravitational fragmentation. A critical limitation of the Jeans criterion is that the background density is assumed to be a constant, which is often not true in dynamic conditions such as star-forming regions. For example, during the formation phase of the high-density gas filaments in a molecular cloud, a density increase rate $\dot \rho$ implies a mass accumulation time of $t_{\rm acc}= \rho / \dot \rho= - \rho (\nabla \cdot (\rho \vec{v}))^{-1}$. The system is non-stationary when the mass accumulation time becomes comparable to the free-fall time $t_{\rm ff} = 1 / \sqrt{G \rho}$. We study fragmentation in non-stationary settings, and find that accretion can significantly increase in the characteristic mass of gravitational fragmentation ( $\lambda_{\rm Jeans,\; aac}= \lambda_{\rm Jeans} (1 + t_{\rm ff} / t_{\rm acc})^{1/3}$, $m_{\rm Jeans,\, acc} = m_{\rm Jeans} (1 + t_{\rm ff} / t_{\rm acc})$). In massive star-forming regions, this mechanism of transport-driven super-jeans fragmentation can contribute to the formation of massive stars by causing order-of-magnitude increases in the mass of the fragments.
#### Circular-ribbon flares and the related activities

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, I will present the recent progress on circular-ribbon flares (CRFs) and their related activities, including coronal jets, filaments, CMEs, radio bursts, coronal dimmings, and coronal loop oscillations. Owing to the prevalence of 3D magnetic null points and the corresponding fan-spine topology in the solar atmosphere, CRFs are regularly observed in UV, EUV, and H$\alpha$ passbands. Spine reconnection and fan reconnection around the null points are predominantly responsible for the energy release and subsequent particle acceleration. Slipping reconnection at QSLs may explain the sequential brightening or rapid degradation of the circular ribbons. Periodic or quasi-periodic acceleration and precipitation of nonthermal particles in the chromosphere produce observed QPPs of CRFs in multiple altitudes as well as wavelengths. Like two-ribbon flares, the injected high-energy particles result in explosive evaporation in circular and inner ribbons, which is characterized by simultaneous blueshifts in the coronal emission lines and redshifts in the chromospheric emission lines. Homologous CRFs residing in the same active region present similar morphology, evolution, and energy partition. The peculiar topology of CRFs with closed outer spines facilitates remote brightenings and EUV late phases, which are uncommon in two-ribbon flares. Besides, CRFs are often accompanied by coronal jets, type III radio bursts, CMEs, shock waves, coronal dimmings, and kink oscillations in coronal loops and filaments. Magnetohydrodynamics numerical simulations are very helpful to understand the key problems that are still unclear up to now. Multiwavelength and multipoint observations with state-of-the-art instruments are enormously desired to make a breakthrough.

 - **Abstract**
 M 87 is the best target for studying black hole accretion and jet formation. Reanalysis of the EHT public data at 230 GHz shows a core-knots structure at the center and jet features (Miyoshi et al. 2022a). We here compare this with the new results of GMVA at 86 GHz showing a spatially resolved central core (Lu et al. 2023a). There are similarities and differences between the two. At 86 GHz,"two bright regions" are seen on the ring in the core."Core-Knot-Westknot", triple structure in the 230 GHz image shows apparent appearance of two peaks similar to the "two bright regions" when convolved with the GMVA beam. This similarity suggests that both frequencies reveal the same objects in the core area. Protrusions are observed on both the south and north sides of the core at both frequencies, becoming prominent and wing-like at 230 GHz. The 86 GHz image shows a triple ridge jet structure, while the 230 GHz image shows only a bright central ridge with two roots. Both frequencies show a shade between the core and the central ridge. To detect the faint features from the EHT2017 data, we found that the use of all baseline data is essential. Using all including the ultrashort baseline data, revealed the jet and faint structures. Without the ultrashort baselines, these structures were not detectable. The lack of detection of any faint structures other than the ring in the M 87 data by the EHTC is presumably due to the exclusion of ultrashort baselines from their analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 The exoplanet diversity has been linked to the disc environment in which they form, where the host star metallicity and the formation pathways play a crucial role. In the context of the core accretion paradigm, the initial stages of planet formation require the growth of dust material from micrometre size to planetesimal size bodies before core accretion can kick in. Although numerous studies have been conducted on planetesimal formation, it is still poorly understood how this process takes place in low metallicity stellar environments. We explore planetesimals formation in stellar environments primarily with low metallicity. We performed global 1D viscous disc evolution simulations including grain growth, evaporation and condensation of chemical species at ice lines. We followed the formation of planetesimals during disc evolution and tested different metallicities, disc sizes and turbulent viscosity strengths. We find that at solar and sub-solar metallicities, there is a significant enhancement in the midplane dust-to-gas mass ratios at the ice lines but this leads to planetesimal formation only at the water ice line. In our simulations, [Fe/H] = -0.6 is the lowest limit of metallicity for planetesimal formation where a few Earth masses of planetesimals could form. For such extreme disc environments, large discs are more conducive than small discs for forming large amounts of planetesimals at a fixed metallicity, because the pebble flux can be maintained for a longer time resulting in a longer and more efficient planetesimal formation phase. At lower metallicities, planetesimal formation is less supported in quiescent discs compared to turbulent discs, because the pebble flux can be maintained for a longer time. The amount of planetesimals formed at sub-solar metallicities in our simulations places a limit on core sizes that could possibly only result in the formation of super-Earths.

 - **Abstract**
 To understand its evolution and the effects of its eruptive events, the Sun is permanently monitored by multiple satellite missions. The optically-thin emission of the solar plasma and the limited number of viewpoints make it challenging to reconstruct the geometry and structure of the solar atmosphere; however, this information is the missing link to understand the Sun as it is: a three-dimensional evolving star. We present a method that enables a complete 3D representation of the uppermost solar layer (corona) observed in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light. We use a deep learning approach for 3D scene representation that accounts for radiative transfer, to map the entire solar atmosphere from three simultaneous observations. We demonstrate that our approach provides unprecedented reconstructions of the solar poles, and directly enables height estimates of coronal structures, solar filaments, coronal hole profiles, and coronal mass ejections. We validate the approach using model-generated synthetic EUV images, finding that our method accurately captures the 3D geometry of the Sun even from a limited number of 32 ecliptic viewpoints ($|\text{latitude}| \leq 7^\circ$). We quantify uncertainties of our model using an ensemble approach that allows us to estimate the model performance in absence of a ground-truth. Our method enables a novel view of our closest star, and is a breakthrough technology for the efficient use of multi-instrument datasets, which paves the way for future cluster missions.
#### Majority of water hides deep in the interiors of exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 Water is an important component of exoplanets, with its distribution, i.e., whether at the surface or deep inside, fundamentally influencing the planetary properties. The distribution of water in most exoplanets is determined by yet-unknown partitioning coefficients at extreme conditions. Our new first-principles molecular dynamics simulations reveal that water strongly partitions into iron over silicate at high pressures and thus would preferentially stay in a planet's core. Furthermore, we model planet interiors by considering the effect of water on density, melting temperature, and water partitioning. The results shatter the notion of water worlds as imagined before: the majority of the bulk water budget (even more than 95%) can be stored deep within the core and the mantle, and not at the surface. For planets more massive than ~6 Earth's mass and Earth-size planets (of lower mass and small water budgets), the majority of water resides deep in the cores of planets, Whether water is assumed to be at the surface or at depth can affect the radius by up to 25% for a given mass. This has drastic consequences for the inferred water distribution in exoplanets from mass-radius data.
