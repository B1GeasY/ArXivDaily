 - **Abstract**
 Deep interferometric observations of CO and dust continuum emission are obtained with the Sub-Millimeter Array (SMA) at 230 GHz to investigate the physical nature of the giant molecular cloud (GMC) population in the Andromeda galaxy (M31). We use J = 2-1 $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO emission to derive the masses, sizes and velocity dispersions of 162 spatially resolved GMCs. We perform a detailed study of a subset of 117 GMCs that exhibit simple, single component line profile shapes. Examining the Larson scaling relations for these GMCs we find: 1- a highly correlated mass-size relation in both $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO emission; 2- a weakly correlated $^{12}$CO linewidth-size (LWS) relation along with a weaker, almost non-existent, $^{13}$CO LWS relation, suggesting a possible dependence of the LWS relation on spatial scale; and 3-that only 43\% of these GMCs are gravitationally bound. We identify two classes of GMCs based on the strength and extent of their $^{13}$CO emission. Examination of the Larson relations finds that both classes are individually characterized by strong $^{12}$CO mass-size relations and much weaker $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO LWS relations. The majority (73\%) of strong $^{13}$CO emitting GMCs are found to be gravitationally bound. However, only 25\% of the weak $^{13}$CO emitting GMCs are bound. The resulting breakdown in the Larson relations in the weak $^{13}$CO emitting population decouples the mass-size and LWS relations demonstrating that independent physical causes are required to understand the origin of each. Finally, in nearly every aspect, the physical properties of the M31 GMCs are found to be very similar to those of local Milky Way clouds.

 Aims. We aim to investigate the molecular environment of the supernova remnant (SNR) G150.3+4.5, and explore its association with ambient molecular clouds (MCs). Methods. We present large-field CO (J=1-0) molecular line observations toward SNR G150.3+4.5, using the 13.7 m millimeter telescope of the Purple Mountain Observatory. The observations have an angular resolution of $\sim 55 ''$. We analyzed the spatial distribution of MCs in relation to the SNR shell detected in previous Urumqi $\lambda$ 6 cm radio observations and examined the CO spectra for kinematics information. Results. We find that MCs at the velocity range of [-14, -2] km s$^{-1}$ are spatially distributed along the radio shell of the SNR. Line broadening and asymmetries are observed in the CO spectra of the clouds. Moreover, we find that the molecular clouds around the shell have systematic velocity gradients in the position-velocity (PV) diagrams. Both morphology alignment and gas kinematics suggest that the SNR is associated with the ambient MCs at $\sim$ 740 pc. Based on the CO gas distance, the dimension and the age of the SNR is estimated to be 40 pc $\times$ 33 pc and 3.8 $ \times 10^4$ years, respectively. The very high energy emission of 1LHAASO J0428+5531 toward the SNR may originate from the interaction between the SNR and the surrounding MCs.

 - **Abstract**
 Using starlight polarization, we present the properties of foreground dust towards cluster NGC 7380 embedded in H{\sc ii} region Sh 2-142. Observations of starlight polarization are carried out in four filters using an imaging polarimeter equipped with a 104-cm ARIES telescope. Polarization vectors of stars are aligned along the Galactic magnetic field. Towards the east and southeast regions, the dust structure appears much denser than in other regions (inferred from extinction contours and colour composite image) and is also reflected in polarization distribution. We find that the polarization degree and extinction tend to increase with distance and indication for the presence of a dust layer at a distance of around 1.2 $kpc$. We have identified eight potential candidates exhibiting intrinsic polarization by employing three distinct criteria to distinguish between stars of intrinsic polarization and interstellar polarized stars. For interstellar polarized stars, we find that the maximum polarization degree increases with the color excess and has a strong scatter, with the mean value of 1.71$\pm$0.57$\%$. The peak wavelength spans $0.40-0.88\mu$m with the mean value of 0.56$\pm$0.07 $\mu m$, suggesting similar grain sizes in the region as the average diffuse interstellar medium. The polarization efficiency is also found to decrease with visual extinction as $P_{max}/A_{V}\propto A_{V}^{-0.61}$. Our observational results are found to be consistent with the predictions by the radiative torque alignment theory.
#### Clumpy accretion as a possible reason of prolonged eclipses of UX~Ori  type stars
 - **Authors:** Vladimir Grinin, Tatiana Demidova
 - **Subjects:** Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.20065
 - **Abstract**
 The paper proposes a model of deep and prolonged eclipses of young stars of the UX~Ori type. Some of these events continue for decades and existing models cannot explain them. Our paper shows that such eclipses can be caused by the falling of gas and dust clump from the remnants of the protostellar cloud onto the protoplanetary disk. The disturbance in the disk caused by the fall of the clump leads to a surge in the accretion activity of the star and, as a consequence, to an increase in the disk wind. If the circumstellar disk is tilted at a slight angle to the line of sight, then dust raised by the wind from the surface of the disk can cause a strong decrease in the star's brightness, which can last for decades.
