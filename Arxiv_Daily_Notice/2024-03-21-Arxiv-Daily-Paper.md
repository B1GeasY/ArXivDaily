 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar medium in the Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is known to be strongly magnetised, but its large-scale morphology and impact on the gas dynamics are not well understood. We explore the impact and properties of magnetic fields in the CMZ using three-dimensional non-self gravitating magnetohydrodynamical simulations of gas flow in an external Milky Way barred potential. We find that: (1) The magnetic field is conveniently decomposed into a regular time-averaged component and an irregular turbulent component. The regular component aligns well with the velocity vectors of the gas everywhere, including within the bar lanes. (2) The field geometry transitions from parallel to the Galactic plane near $z=0$ to poloidal away from the plane. (3) The magneto-rotational instability (MRI) causes an in-plane inflow of matter from the CMZ gas ring towards the central few parsecs of $0.01-0.1$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ that is absent in the unmagnetised simulations. However, the magnetic fields have no significant effect on the larger-scale bar-driven inflow that brings the gas from the Galactic disc into the CMZ. (4) A combination of bar inflow and MRI-driven turbulence can sustain a turbulent vertical velocity dispersion of $\sigma_z \simeq 5$ km s$^{-1}$ on scales of $20$ pc in the CMZ ring. The MRI alone sustains a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_z \simeq 3$ km s$^{-1}$. Both these numbers are lower than the observed velocity dispersion of gas in the CMZ, suggesting that other processes such as stellar feedback are necessary to explain the observations. (5) Dynamo action driven by differential rotation and the MRI amplifies the magnetic fields in the CMZ ring until they saturate at a value that scales with the average local density as $B \simeq 102 (n/10^3 cm^{-3})^{0.33}$ $\mu$G. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results within the observational context in the CMZ.

 - **Abstract**
 As a stellar group forms within its parent molecular cloud, new members first appear in the deep interior. These overcrowded stars continually diffuse outward to the cloud boundary, and even beyond. Observations have so far documented only the interior drift. Those stars that actually leave the cloud form an expanding envelope that I call the "stellar mantle." Simple fluid models for the cloud and mantle illustrate their basic structure. The mantle's expansion speed is subsonic with respect to the cloud's dynamical temperature. I describe, in qualitative terms, how the expanding mantle and Galactic tidal radius might together shape the evolution of specific types of stellar groups. The massive stars in OB associations form in clouds that contract before extruding a substantial mantle. In contrast, the more slowly evolving clouds forming open clusters and T associations have extended mantles that encounter a shrinking tidal radius. These clouds are dispersed by internal stellar outflows. If the remaining group of stars is gravitationally bound, it appears as a long-lived open cluster, truncated by the tidal radius. If the group is unbound, it is a late-stage T association that will soon be torn apart by the tidal force. The "distributed" populations of pre-main~sequence stars observed in the outskirts of several star-forming regions are too distant to be stellar mantles. Rather, they could be the remnants of especially low-mass T associations.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova remnants (SNRs) exert strong influence on the physics and chemistry of the nearby molecular clouds (MCs) through shock waves and the cosmic rays (CRs) they accelerate. To investigate the SNR-cloud interaction in the prototype interacting SNR W28 (G6.4$-$0.1), we present new observations of $\rm HCO^+$, HCN and HNC $J=1\text{--}0$ lines, supplemented by archival data of CO isotopes, $\rm N_2H^+$ and $\rm H^{13}CO^+$. We compare the spatial distribution and spectral line profiles of different molecular species. Using local thermodynatic equilibrium (LTE) assumption, we obtain an abundance ratio $N({\rm HCO^+})/N({\rm CO})\sim10^{-4}$ in the northeastern shocked cloud, which is higher by an order of magnitude than the values in unshocked clouds. This can be accounted for by the chemistry jointly induced by shock and CRs, with the physical parameters previously obtained from observations: preshock density $n_{\rm H}\sim 2\times 10^{5}\rm \ cm^{-3}$, CR ionization rate $\zeta=2.5\times 10^{-15} \rm \ s^{-1}$ and shock velocity $V_{\rm s}=15\text{--}20\rm \ km\ s^{-1}$. Towards a point outside the northeastern boundary of W28 with known high CR ionization rate, we estimate the abundance ratio $ N({\rm HCO^+})/N({\rm N_2H^+}) \approx 0.6\text{--}3.3$, which can be reproduced by a chemical simulation if a high density $n_{\rm H}\sim 2\times 10^5 \ \rm cm^{-3}$ is adopted.

 - **Abstract**
 Repeating X-ray bursts from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1806-20 have been observed with a period of 398 days. Similarly, periodic X-ray bursts from SGR 1935+2154 with a period of 238 days have also been observed. Here we argue that these X-ray bursts could be produced by the interaction of a neutron star (NS) with its planet in a highly elliptical orbit. The periastron of the planet is very close to the NS, so it would be partially disrupted by the tidal force every time it passes through the periastron. Major fragments generated in the process will fall onto the NS under the influence of gravitational perturbation. The collision of the in-falling fragments with the NS produces repeating X-ray bursts. The main features of the observed X-ray bursts, such as their energy, duration, periodicity, and activity window, can all be explained in our framework.
#### Gas inflows from cloud to core scales in G332.83-0.55: Hierarchical  hub-filament structures and tide-regulated gravitational collapse

 - **Abstract**
 The massive star-forming region G332.83-0.55 contains at least two levels of hub-filament structures. The hub-filament structures may form through the "gravitational focusing" process. High-resolution LAsMA and ALMA observations can directly trace the gas inflows from cloud to core scales. We investigated the effects of shear and tides from the protocluster on the surrounding local dense gas structures. Our results seem to deny the importance of shear and tides from the protocluster. However, for a gas structure, it bears the tidal interactions from all external material, not only the protocluster. To fully consider the tidal interactions, we derived the tide field according to the surface density distribution. Then, we used the average strength of the external tidal field of a structure to measure the total tidal interactions that are exerted on it. For comparison, we also adopted an original pixel-by-pixel computation to estimate the average tidal strength for each structure. Both methods give comparable results. After considering the total tidal interactions, the slope of the $\sigma-N*R$ relation changes from 0.20 to 0.52, close to 0.5 of the pure free-fall gravitational collapse, and the correlation also becomes stronger. Thus, the deformation due to the external tides can effectively slow down the pure free-fall gravitational collapse of gas structures. The external tide tries to tear up the structure, but the external pressure on the structure prevents this process. The counterbalance between the external tide and external pressure hinders the free-fall gravitational collapse of the structure, which can also cause the pure free-fall gravitational collapse to be slowed down. These mechanisms can be called "tide-regulated gravitational collapse."
#### Application of hydrostatic LTE atmosphere models to interpretation of  supersoft X-ray sources spectra

 - **Abstract**
 Super-soft X-ray sources (SSSs) are accreting white dwarfs (WDs) with stable or recurrent thermonuclear burning on their surfaces. High resolution X-ray spectra of such objects are rather complex, can consist of several components, and are difficult to interpret accurately. The main emission source is the hot surface of the WD, and the emergent radiation can potentially be described by hot WD model atmospheres. We present a new set of such model atmosphere spectra computed in the effective temperature range from $100\rm\,kK$ to $1000\rm\,kK$, for eight values of surface gravity, and three different chemical compositions. These compositions correspond to the solar one and to the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds with decreased heavy element abundances, at one-half and one-tenth of the solar value. The presented model grid covers a broad range of physical parameters, and thus can be applied to a wide range of objects. It is also publicly available in XSPEC format. As an illustration, we applied it here for the interpretation of Chandra and XMM grating spectra of two classical SSSs, namely, CAL$\,83$ (RX$\,$J0543.5$-$6823) and RX$\,$J0513.9$-$6951. The obtained effective temperatures and surface gravities of $T_{\rm eff} \approx 560\,$kK, $\log g \approx 8.6-8.7$, and $T_{\rm eff} \approx 630 {\rm kK}, \log g \approx 8.5-8.6$, respectively, are in a good agreement with previous estimations for both sources. Derived WD~mass estimations are within $1.1-1.4\,M_\odot$ for CAL 83 and $1.15-1.4\, M_\odot$ for RX$\,$J0513.9$-$6951. The mass of the WD in CAL$\,83$ is consistent with the mass predicted from the respective model of recurrent thermonuclear burning.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of stars, particularly the high-mass star formation, poses several still open questions. Nowadays, thanks to the most modern telescopes and instruments, we are able to observe and analyse many physical and chemical processes involved in the birth of massive stars. This work introduces to the interstellar medium, cradle of the stars, and makes focus on the interstellar structures distributed in the different spatial scales related to the collapse of the gas that gives rise to the star formation processes. Through some current works done by the investigation group of Interstellar Medium, Star Formation and Astrochemistry belonging to Instituto de Astronom\'ia y F\'isica del Espacio (https://interestelariafe.wixsite.com/mediointerestelar), it is shown that the observational study of the star formation is a research that must be carried out in a multispectral way, pointing to the spatial multiscale.
#### Sculpting the Morphology of Supernova Remnant Pa 30 via Efficient Ejecta  Cooling
 - **Authors:** Paul C. Duffell, Abigail Polin, Soham Mandal
 - **Subjects:** High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13641
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13641
 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate in a proof-of-concept numerical hydrodynamics calculation that the narrow radial filamentary structures seen in Pa 30 could be generated through highly efficient cooling (e.g. via line emission) in the ejecta. Efficient cooling in the ejecta causes a drop of pressure support in Rayleigh-Taylor fingers, leading them to be compressed, and suppressing the growth of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Following this result, we make three predictions that could determine whether this is the mechanism responsible for shaping Pa 30: First, we predict very strong emission lines, strong enough to cool a significant fraction of the shock energy in an expansion time. Secondly, we predict that the forward shock should be highly corrugated on small scales, with the shock front closely following the structure of the filaments. Third, we predict that these filaments should be nearly ballistic, with velocities around 90% of the free-expansion velocity ($v \approx 0.9 ~r/t$). These predictions should be falsifiable in follow-up observations of this remnant.
#### Examining a hadronic $γ$-ray scenario for the radiative shell &  molecular clouds of the old GeV supernova remnant G298.6$-$0.0

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the 13.7~yr Fermi-LAT data, Yeung et al. (2023) claimed detection of two $\gamma$-ray sources (Src-NE and Src-NW) associated with the supernova remnant (SNR) G298.6$-$0.0, and interpreted it as an old GeV SNR interacting with molecular clouds (MCs). In this follow-up study, we refine the flux measurements below 2~GeV with Fermi-LAT event types of better angular reconstruction. Then, we report our cosmic-ray phenomenology in a hadronic scenario, considering both the shell and MC regions of SNR G298.6$-$0.0. We confirm that both the $\gamma$-ray spectra of Src-NE and Src-NW exhibit spectral breaks at $1.50_{-0.50}^{+0.60}$~GeV and $0.68_{-0.11}^{+0.32}$~GeV, respectively. Src-NW has a harder broadband photon index than Src-NE, suggesting an appreciable difference between the physical separations of their respective emission sites from SNR G298.6$-$0.0. The cosmic-ray spectrum responsible for Src-NE starts with a minimum energy $E_\mathrm{CR,min}=1.38_{-0.16}^{+0.47}$~GeV, and has a proton index $\Gamma_\mathrm{CR}=2.57_{-0.21}^{+0.18}$ below the exponential cutoff energy $E_\mathrm{CR,max}=240_{-150}^{+240}$~GeV. Accordingly, we argue that Src-NE is dominated by the SNR shell, while only a minor portion of lower-energy emission is contributed by the MCs interacting with the SNR. The cosmic-ray population for Src-NW starts at a higher energy such that the $E_\mathrm{CR,min}$ ratio of Src-NW to Src-NE is $\gtrsim$2. The high $E_\mathrm{CR,min}$, as well as the high cosmic-ray energy density required ($\sim$26~eV~cm$^{-3}$), supports the interpretation that Src-NW is predominantly the $\gamma$-ray emission from the farther MCs being bombarded by protons that had earlier escaped from SNR G298.6$-$0.0. By comparing the high-energy features of G298.6$-$0.0 with those of analogical SNRs, especially SNR W28 and SNR W44, we further constrain the age of SNR G298.6$-$0.0 to be 10--30~kyr.
