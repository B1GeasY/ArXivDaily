 - **Abstract**
 Extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) measurements contend with internal noise (instrumental systematics) and external noise (intrinsic stellar variability) on the road to 10 cm/s "exo-Earth" sensitivity. Both of these noise sources are well-probed using "Sun-as-a-star" RVs and cross-instrument comparisons. We built the Solar Calibrator (SoCal), an autonomous system that feeds stable, disc-integrated sunlight to the recently commissioned Keck Planet Finder (KPF) at the W. M. Keck Observatory. With SoCal, KPF acquires signal-to-noise ~1200, R = ~98,000 optical (445--870 nm) spectra of the Sun in 5~sec exposures at unprecedented cadence for an EPRV facility using KPF's fast readout mode (<16 sec between exposures). Daily autonomous operation is achieved by defining an operations loop using state machine logic. Data affected by clouds are automatically flagged using a reliable quality control metric derived from simultaneous irradiance measurements. Comparing solar data across the growing global network of EPRV spectrographs with solar feeds will allow EPRV teams to disentangle internal and external noise sources and benchmark spectrograph performance. To facilitate this, all SoCal data products are immediately available to the public on the Keck Observatory Archive. We compared SoCal RVs to contemporaneous RVs from NEID, the only other immediately public EPRV solar dataset. We find agreement at the 30-40 cm/s level on timescales of several hours, which is comparable to the combined photon-limited precision. Data from SoCal were also used to assess a detector problem and wavelength calibration inaccuracies associated with KPF during early operations. Long-term SoCal operations will collect upwards of 1,000 solar spectra per six-hour day using KPF's fast readout mode, enabling stellar activity studies at high signal-to-noise on our nearest solar-type star.
#### ALMA Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (ALMASOP): Discovery of  an extremely dense and compact object embedded in the prestellar core  G208.68-19.92-N2

 - **Abstract**
 The internal structure of the prestellar core G208.68-19.02-N2 (G208-N2) in the Orion Molecular Cloud 3 (OMC-3) region has been studied with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The dust continuum emission revealed a filamentary structure with a length of $\sim$5000 au and an average H$_2$ volume density of $\sim$6 $\times$ 10$^7$ cm$^{-3}$. At the tip of this filamentary structure, there is a compact object, which we call a ``nucleus", with a radius of $\sim$150--200 au and a mass of $\sim$0.1 M$_{\odot}$. The nucleus has a central density of $\sim$2 $\times$ 10$^9$ cm$^{-3}$ with a radial density profile of $r^{-1.87{\pm}0.11}$. The density scaling of the nucleus is $\sim$3.7 times higher than that of the singular isothermal sphere. This as well as the very low virial parameter of 0.39 suggest that the gravity is dominant over the pressure everywhere in the nucleus. However, there is no sign of CO outflow localized to this nucleus. The filamentary structure is traced by the N$_2$D$^+$ 3--2 emission, but not by the C$^{18}$O 2--1 emission, implying the significant CO depletion due to high density and cold temperature. Toward the nucleus, the N$_2$D$^+$ also shows the signature of depletion. This could imply either the depletion of the parent molecule, N$_2$, or the presence of the embedded very-low luminosity central source that could sublimate the CO in the very small area. The nucleus in G208-N2 is considered to be a prestellar core on the verge of first hydrostatic core (FHSC) formation or a candidate for the FHSC.
#### Study of the variability and components of the pulsar B0823+26 at a  frequency of 111 MHz

 - **Abstract**
 Studies of the pulsar B0823+26 have been carried out using the Large Phased Array (LPA) radio telescope. At time span of 5.5 years, the amplitudes of the main pulse (MP), postcursor (PC) and interpulse (IP) were evaluated in daily sessions lasting 3.7 minutes. It is shown that the ratio of the average amplitudes of MP in the bright (B) and quiet (Q) modes is 60. For B-mode, the average ratio of MP amplitudes to IP amplitudes is 65, and the ratio of MP amplitudes to PC amplitudes is 28. The number of sessions with a nulling is 4% of the total number of sessions. Structure function (SF) and correlation function analysis of MP, IP and PC amplitude variations of over a long-time interval allowed us to detect typical time scales 37 \pm 5 days and one year. The analysis of time variations shows that the time scale of 37 days is well explained by refraction on inhomogeneities of interstellar plasma, which is distributed mostly quasi-uniformly in the line-of-sight. This scintillation makes the main contribution to the observed variability. Analysis of the structure function showed that there may be a few days variability. This time scale does not have an unambiguous interpretation but is apparently associated with the refraction of radio waves on the interstellar medium. One-year variability time scale has not been previously detected. We associate its appearance with the presence of a scattering layer on a closely located screen at a distance of about 50-100 pc from the Earth.
#### The "Drake equation'' of exomoons -- a cascade of formation, stability  and detection

 - **Abstract**
 After 25 years of the prediction of the possibility of observations, and despite the many hundred of well studied transiting exoplanet systems, we are still waiting for the announcement of the first confirmed exomoon. Following the ``cascade'' structure of the Drake-equation, but applied to the existence of an observable exomoon instead the original scope of extraterrestrial intelligence. The scope of this paper is to reveal the structure of the problem, rather than giving a quantitative solution. We identify three important steps that can lead us to the discovery. The steps are the formation, the orbital dynamics and long-term stability, and the observability of a given exomoon in a given system. This way, the question will be closely related to questions of star formation, planet formation, 5 possible pathways of moon formation; long-term dynamics of evolved planet systems involving stellar and planetary rotation and internal structure; and the proper evaluation of the observed data, taken the correlated noise of stellar and instrumental origin and the sampling function also into account. This way, a successful exomoon observation and the interpretations of the expectable further measurements proves to be among the most complex and most interdisciplinary questions in astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of core-collapse supernova remnants (SNRs) presents a fascinating puzzle, with intricate morphologies and a non-uniform distribution of stellar debris. Particularly, young remnants (aged less than 5000 years) hold immense value as they can offer crucial insights into the inner processes of the supernova (SN) engine, revealing details about nucleosynthetic yields and large-scale asymmetries arising from the early stages of the explosion. Furthermore, these remnants also bear characteristics that may reflect the nature of their progenitor stars and the interactions between the remnants and the surrounding circumstellar medium (CSM), shaped by the progenitor's mass-loss history. Hence, investigating the connection between young SNRs, parent SNe, and progenitor massive stars can be of paramount importance to delve into the physics of SN engines, and to investigate the final stages of massive star evolution and the elusive mechanisms governing their mass loss. In this contribution, I review recent advances in modeling the path from massive stars to SNe and SNRs achieved by our team. The focus is on investigating the links between the observed physical and chemical properties of SNRs and their progenitor stars and SN explosions. The unraveling of this connection offers us the opportunity to probe the physics of core-collapse SN explosions and the final stages of evolution of massive stars.
