 - **Abstract**
 We present a high-resolution spectral study of Fe L-shell extinction by the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) in the direction of the X-ray binaries Cygnus X-1 and GX 339-4, using the XMM-Newton reflection grating spectrometer. The majority of interstellar Fe is suspected to condense into dust grains in the diffuse ISM, but the compounds formed from this process are unknown. Here, we use the laboratory cross sections from Kortright & Kim (2000) and Lee et al. (2009) to model the absorption and scattering profiles of metallic Fe, and the crystalline compounds fayalite (Fe$_2$SiO$_4$), ferrous sulfate (FeSO$_4$), hematite ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$), and lepidocrocite ($\gamma$-FeOOH), which have oxidation states ranging from Fe$^{0}$ to Fe$^{3+}$. We find that the observed Fe L-shell features are systematically offset in energy from the laboratory measurements. An examination of over two dozen published measurements of Fe L-shell absorption finds a 1-2 eV scatter in energy positions of the L-shell features. Motivated by this, we fit for the best energy-scale shift simultaneously with the fine structure of the Fe L-shell extinction cross sections. Hematite and lepidocrocite provide the best fits ($\approx +1.1$ eV shift), followed by fayalite ($\approx +1.8$ eV shift). However, fayalite is disfavored, based on the implied abundances and knowledge of ISM silicates gained by infrared astronomical observations and meteoritic studies. We conclude that iron oxides in the Fe$^{3+}$ oxidation state are good candidates for Fe-bearing dust. To verify this, new absolute photoabsorption measurements are needed on an energy scale accurate to better than 0.2 eV.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the discovery of the first ultra metal-poor (UMP) star 2MASS~J20500194$-$6613298 (J2050$-$6613; \mbox{[Fe/H] = $-4.05$}) selected from the Gaia BP/RP spectral catalog that belongs to the ancient Atari disk component. We obtained a high-resolution spectrum for the star with the MIKE spectrograph on the Magellan-Clay telescope. J2050$-$6613 displays a typical chemical abundance pattern for UMP stars, including carbon and zinc enhancements. In contrast, J2050$-$6613 shows extremely high [Sr/Fe] and [Sr/Ba] ratios compared to other stars in the [Fe/H] $<-4.0$ regime. J2050$-$6613 is most likely an early Population\,II star that formed from a gas cloud that was chemically enriched by a massive Population\,III hypernova (E $> 10^{52}$\,erg). Such a Population\,III core-collapse hypernova could simultaneously explain the origin of the abundance pattern of light and heavy elements of 2MASS~J2050$-$6613 if a large amount of Sr of $\sim10^{-5}$\,M$_{\odot}$ was produced, possibly by neutrino-driven \textbf{(wind)} ejecta. Therefore, the abundance pattern of 2MASS~J2050$-$6613 places important constraints on Sr-producing nucleosynthesis sources operating in the Atari progenitor at the earliest times.

 - **Abstract**
 We present 870 um polarimetric observations toward 61 protostars in the Orion molecular clouds, with ~400 au (1") resolution using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We successfully detect dust polarization and outflow emission in 56 protostars, in 16 of them the polarization is likely produced by self-scattering. Self-scattering signatures are seen in several Class 0 sources, suggesting that grain growth appears to be significant in disks at earlier protostellar phases. For the rest of the protostars, the dust polarization traces the magnetic field, whose morphology can be approximately classified into three categories: standard-hourglass, rotated-hourglass (with its axis perpendicular to outflow), and spiral-like morphology. 40.0% (+-3.0%) of the protostars exhibit a mean magnetic field direction approximately perpendicular to the outflow on several 100--1000 au scales. However, in the remaining sample, this relative orientation appears to be random, probably due to the complex set of morphologies observed. Furthermore, we classify the protostars into three types based on the C17O (3--2) velocity envelope's gradient: perpendicular to outflow, non-perpendicular to outflow, and unresolved gradient (<1.0~km/s/arcsec). In protostars with a velocity gradient perpendicular to outflow, the magnetic field lines are preferentially perpendicular to outflow, most of them exhibit a rotated hourglass morphology, suggesting that the magnetic field has been overwhelmed by gravity and angular momentum. Spiral-like magnetic fields are associated with envelopes having large velocity gradients, indicating that the rotation motions are strong enough to twist the field lines. All of the protostars with a standard-hourglass field morphology show no significant velocity gradient due to the strong magnetic braking.

 - **Abstract**
 When low- and intermediate-mass stars evolve off the main sequence, they expand and cool into the red giant stages of evolution, which include those associated with shell H burning (the red giant branch), core He burning (the red clump), and shell He burning (the asymptotic giant branch). The majority of red giants have masses $< 2 M_\odot$, and red giants more massive than this are often excluded from major studies. Here we present a study of the highest-mass stars ($M > 3.0 M_\odot$) in the Kepler sample of 16,000 red giants. We begin by re-estimating their global seismic properties with new light curves, highlighting the differences between using the SAP and PDCSAP light curves provided by Kepler. We use the re-estimated properties to derive new mass estimates for the stars, ending with a final sample of 48 confirmed high-mass stars. We explore their oscillation envelopes, confirming the trends found in recent works such as low mean mode amplitude and wide envelopes. We find, through probabilistic means, that our sample is likely all core He burning stars. We measure their dipole and quadrupole mode visibilities and confirm that the dipole mode visibility tends to decrease with mass.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed structural and gas kinematic study of the star-forming complex W5-NW. A cloud-cloud collision scenario unravels with evidences of collision induced star and cluster formation. Various signatures of cloud-cloud collision such as "complementary distribution" and "bridging-features" are explored. At the colliding region, the two clouds have complementary morphologies, where W5-NWb has a filamentary key-like shape which fits into the U-shaped cavity in W5-NWa that behaves like a keyhole. The interaction region between the two clouds is characterised by bridging features with intermediate velocities connecting the two clouds. A skewed V-shaped bridging feature is also detected at the site of collision. A robust picture of the molecular gas distribution highlighting the bridges is seen in the position-position-velocity diagram obtained using the SCOUSEPY algorithm. Star cluster formation with an over-density of Class I and Class II young stellar objects is also seen towards this cloud complex, likely triggered by the cloud collision event.
#### Dynamics of Saturn's Polar Regions

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze data retrieved by the Imaging Science System onboard the Cassini spacecraft to study the horizontal velocity and vorticity fields of Saturn's Polar Regions (latitudes 60-90$^\circ$N in June-December 2013 and 60-90$^\circ$S in October 2006 and July-December 2008), including the Northern region where the hexagonal wave is prominent. With the aid of an automated two dimensional correlation algorithm we determine two-dimensional maps of zonal and meridional winds, and deduce vorticity maps. We extract zonal averages of zonal winds, providing wind profiles that reach latitudes as high 89.5$^\circ$ in the south and 89.9$^\circ$ in the north. Wind measurements cover the intense polar cyclonic vortices that reach similar peak velocities of 150 ms-1 at 88.5$^\circ$. The hexagonal wave lies in the core of an intense eastward jet at planetocentric latitude 75.8$^\circ$N with motions that become non-zonal at the hexagonal feature. In the south hemisphere the peak of the eastward jet is located at planetocentric latitude 70.4$^\circ$S. A large anticyclone (the South Polar Spot, SPS), similar to the North Polar Spot (NPS) observed at the Voyager times (1980-81), has been observed in images from April 2008 to January 2009 in the South Polar Region at latitude -66.1$^\circ$ close to the eastward jet. The SPS does not apparently excite a wave on the jet. We analyze the stability of the zonal jets, finding potential instabilities at the flanks of the eastward jets around 70$^\circ$ and we measure the eddy wind components, suggesting momentum transfer from eddy motion to the westward jets closer to the poles.
#### A Statistical and Multiwavelength Photometric Analysis of a Young  Embedded Open Star Cluster: IC 1590

 - **Abstract**
 We present a statistical and multiwavelength photometric studies of young open cluster IC 1590. We identified 91 cluster members using $Gaia$ DR3 astrometry data using ensemble-based unsupervised machine learning techniques. From $Gaia$ EDR3 data, we estimate the best-fitted parameters for IC 1590 using the Automated Stellar Cluster Analysis package (ASteCA) yielding the distance $d$ $\sim$ 2.87 $\pm$ 0.02 Kpc, age $\sim$ 3.54 $\pm$ 0.05 Myr, metallicity $z$ $\sim$ 0.0212 $\pm$ 0.003, binarity value of $\sim$ 0.558, and extinction $A_v$ $\sim$ 1.252 $\pm$ 0.4 mag for an $R_v$ value of $\sim$ 3.322 $\pm$ 0.23. We estimate the initial mass function slope of the cluster to be $\alpha$ = 1.081 $\pm$ 0.112 for single stars and $\alpha$ = 1.490 $\pm$ 0.051 for a binary fraction of $\sim$ 0.558 in the mass range 1 M$_{\odot}$ $\leq$ m(M$_{\odot}$) $\leq$ 100 M$_{\odot}$. The $G$-band luminosity function slope is estimated to be $\sim$ 0.33 $\pm$ 0.09. We use $(J-H)$ versus $(H-K_s)$ color-color diagram to identify young stellar objects (YSOs). We found that all the identified YSOs have ages $\leq$ 2 Myr and masses $\sim$ 0.35 - 5.5 M$_{\odot}$. We also fit the radial surface density profile. Using the galpy we performed orbit analysis of the cluster. The extinction map for the cluster region has been generated using the PNICER technique and it is almost similar to the dust structure obtained the dust structure from the 500 $\mu$$m$ dust continuum emissions map of $Herschel$ SPIRE. We finally at the end discussed the star formation scenario in the cluster region.
#### Cygnus OB2 as a test case for particle acceleration in young massive  star clusters

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we focus on the scientific case of Cygnus OB2, a northern sky young massive stellar cluster (YMSC) located towards the Cygnus X star-forming complex. We consider a model that assumes cosmic ray acceleration occurring only at the termination shock of the collective wind of the YMSC and address the question of whether, and under what hypotheses, hadronic emission by the accelerated particles can account for the observations of Cygnus OB2 obtained by Fermi-LAT, HAWC and LHAASO. In order to do so, we carefully review the available information on this source, also confronting different estimates of the relevant parameters with ad hoc developed simulations. Once other model parameters are fixed, the spectral and spatial properties of the emission are found to be very sensitive to the unknown properties of the turbulent magnetic field. Comparison with the data shows that our suggested scenario is incompatible with Kolmogorov turbulence. Assuming Kraichnan or Bohm type turbulence spectra, the model accounts well for the Very High Energy (VHE) data, but fails to reproduce the centrally peaked morphology observed by Fermi-LAT, suggesting that additional effects might be important for lower energy $\gamma$-ray emission. We discuss how additional progress can be made with a more detailed and extended knowledge of the spectral and morphological properties of the emission.
