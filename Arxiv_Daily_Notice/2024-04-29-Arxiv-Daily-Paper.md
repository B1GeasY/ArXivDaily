 - **Abstract**
 Sigma Orionis is an open cluster in the nearest giant star formation site - Orion. Its youth (3-5 Myr), low reddening, and relative vicinity make it an important benchmark cluster to study stellar and substellar formation and evolution. Young star-forming sites are complex and hierarchical. Precision astrometry from Gaia DR3 enables the exploration of their fine structure. We used the modified convergent point technique to kinematically re-evaluate the members in the Sigma Orionis cluster and its vicinity. We present clear evidence for three kinematically distinct groups in the Sigma Orionis region. The second group, the RV Orionis association, is adjacent to the Sigma Orionis cluster and is composed only of low-mass stars. The third group, the Flame association, whose age is comparable to that of Sigma Orionis, overlaps with the younger NGC 2024 in the Flame Nebula. In total, we have discovered 105 members of this complex not previously found in the literature (82 in Sigma Orionis, 19 in the Flame association, and 4 in the RV Orionis association).

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of spectral line width measurements from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on {\it Hinode}. We used spectral line profiles of Fe {\sc xvi} 262.984 {\AA}, Fe {\sc xiv} 264.787 {\AA}, Fe {\sc xiv} 270.519 {\AA}, Fe {\sc xiv} 274.203 {\AA}, and Fe {\sc xv} 284.160 {\AA}, and studied 11 active regions. Previous studies of spectral line widths have shown that in hot loops in the cores of active regions, the observed non-thermal velocities are smaller than predicted from models of reconnection jets in the corona or shock heating associated with Alfv\'{e}n waves. The observed line widths are also inconsistent with models of chromospheric evaporation due to coronal nanoflares. We show that recent advances in higher resolution Alfv\'{e}n wave turbulence modeling enables us to obtain non-thermal velocities similar to those measured in active regions. The observed non-thermal velocities for the 11 active regions in our study are in the range of 17$-$30 $\rm km ~ s^{-1}$, consistent with the spectral line non-thermal widths predicted from our model of 16 interacting flux tubes, which are in the range of ~15$-$37 $\rm km ~ s^{-1}$.
#### A JWST Medium Resolution MIRI Spectrum and Models of the Type Ia  supernova 2021aefx at +415 d

 - **Abstract**
 We present a JWST MIRI/MRS spectrum (5-27 $\mathrm{\mu}$m) of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), SN 2021aefx at $+415$ days past $B$-band maximum. The spectrum, which was obtained during the iron-dominated nebular phase, has been analyzed in combination with previous JWST observations of SN 2021aefx, to provide the first JWST time series analysis of an SN Ia. We find the temporal evolution of the [Co III] 11.888 $\mathrm{\mu}$m feature directly traces the decay of $^{56}$Co. The spectra, line profiles, and their evolution are analyzed with off-center delayed-detonation models. Best fits were obtained with White Dwarf (WD) central densities of $\rho_c=0.9-1.1\times 10^9$g cm$^{-3}$, a WD mass of M$_{\mathrm{WD}}$=1.33-1.35M$_\odot$, a WD magnetic field of $\approx10^6$G, and an off-center deflagration-to-detonation transition at $\approx$ 0.5 $M_\odot$ seen opposite to the line of sight of the observer. The inner electron capture core is dominated by energy deposition from $\gamma$-rays whereas a broader region is dominated by positron deposition, placing SN 2021aefx at +415 d in the transitional phase of the evolution to the positron-dominated regime. The formerly `flat-tilted' profile at 9 $\mathrm{\mu}$m now has significant contribution from [Ni IV], [Fe II], and [Fe III] and less from [Ar III], which alters the shape of the feature as positrons excite mostly the low-velocity Ar. Overall, the strength of the stable Ni features in the spectrum is dominated by positron transport rather than the Ni mass. Based on multi-dimensional models, our analysis strongly supports a single-spot, close-to-central ignition with an indication for a pre-existing turbulent velocity field, and excludes a multiple-spot, off-center ignition.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of a star formed out of pair-instability supernova ejecta would have massive implications for the Population III star initial mass function and the existence of stars over 100 Msun, but none have yet been found. Recently, the star LAMOST J1010+2358 was claimed to be a star that formed out of gas enriched by a pair-instability supernova. We present a non-LTE abundance analysis of a new high-resolution Keck/HIRES spectrum of J1010+2358. We determined the carbon and aluminum abundances needed to definitively distinguish between enrichment by a pair-instability and core-collapse supernova. Our new analysis demonstrates that J1010+2358 does not have the unique abundance pattern of a a pair-instability supernova, but was instead enriched by the ejecta of a low mass core-collapse supernova. Thus, there are still no known stars displaying unambiguous signatures of pair-instability supernovae.
#### Exploring the properties of photosphere and emission lines for tidal  disruption events based on the global solution of slim disk and winds

 - **Abstract**
 The theoretical debris supply rate from a tidal disruption of stars can exceed about one hundred times of the Eddington accretion rate for a $10^{6-7}M_{\odot}$ supermassive black hole (SMBH). It is believed that a strong wind will be launched from the disk surface due to the radiation pressure in the case of super-Eddington accretion, which may be one of the mechanisms for formation of the envelope as observed in tidal disruption events (TDEs). In this work, we explore the evolution of the envelope that formed from the optical thick winds by solving the global solution of the slim-disk model. Our model can roughly reproduce the typical temperature, luminosity and size of the photosphere for TDEs. Based on \texttt{CLOUDY} modeling, we find that, if only considering the radiation-driven disk wind, the emission line luminosities are normally much lower than the typical observational results due to the limited atmosphere mass outside the envelope. We propose that the ejection of the outflow from the self-collision of the stellar debris during the circularization may provide enough matter outside the disk-wind photosphere. Our calculated spectra can roughly reproduce the main properties of several typical emission lines (e.g., $\rm H\alpha$, $\rm H\beta$ and \ion{He}{2}), which was applied well to a TDE candidate AT2018dyb.
#### Bridging theory and observations in stellar pulsations: The impact of  convection and metallicity on the instability strips of Classical and Type-II  Cepheids

 - **Abstract**
 The effect of metallicity on the theoretical and empirical period-luminosity (PL) relations of Cepheid variables is not well understood and remains a highly debated issue. Here, we examine empirical colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of Classical and Type-II Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds and compare those with the theoretically predicted instability strip (IS) edges. We explore the effects of incorporating turbulent flux, turbulent pressure, and radiative cooling into the convection theory on the predicted IS at various metallicities using MESA-RSP. We find that the edges become redder with the increasing complexity of convection physics incorporated in the fiducial convection sets, and are similarly shifted to the red with increasing metallicity. The inclusion of turbulent flux and pressure improves the agreement of the red edge of the IS, while their exclusion leads to better agreement with observations of the blue edge. About 90% of observed stars are found to fall within the predicted bluest and reddest edges across the considered variations of turbulent convection parameters. Furthermore, we identify and discuss discrepancies between theoretical and observed CMDs in the low effective temperature and high luminosity regions for stars with periods greater than ~ 20 days. These findings highlight the potential for calibrating the turbulent convection parameters in stellar pulsation models or the prediction of a new class of rare, long-period, 'red Cepheids', thereby improving our understanding of Cepheids and their role in cosmological studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields in the stellar interiors are key candidates to explain observed core rotation rates inside solar-like stars along their evolution. Recently, asteroseismic estimates of radial magnetic field amplitudes near the hydrogen-burning shell (H-shell) inside about 24 red-giants (RGs) have been obtained by measuring frequency splittings from their power spectra. Using general Lorentz-stress (magnetic) kernels, we investigated the potential for detectability of near-surface magnetism in a 1.3 $M_{\odot}$ star of super-solar metallicity as it evolves from a mid sub-giant to a late sub-giant into an RG. Based on these sensitivity kernels, we decompose an RG into three zones - deep core, H-shell, and near-surface. The sub-giants instead required decomposition into an inner core, an outer core, and a near-surface layer. Additionally, we find that for a low-frequency g-dominated dipolar mode in the presence of a typical stable magnetic field, ~25% of the frequency shift comes from the H-shell and the remaining from deeper layers. The ratio of the subsurface tangential field to the radial field in H-burning shell decides if subsurface fields may be potentially detectable. For p-dominated dipole modes close to $\nu_\rm{max}$, this ratio is around two orders of magnitude smaller in subgiant phases than the corresponding RG. Further, with the availability of magnetic kernels, we propose lower limits of field strengths in crucial layers in our stellar model during its evolutionary phases. The theoretical prescription outlined here provides the first formal way to devise inverse problems for stellar magnetism and can be seamlessly employed for slow rotators.

 - **Abstract**
 The star formation rate (SFR), the number of stars formed per unit of time, is a fundamental quantity in the evolution of the Universe. While turbulence is believed to play a crucial role in setting the SFR, the exact mechanism remains unclear. Turbulence promotes star formation by compressing the gas, but also slows it down by stabilizing the gas against gravity. Most widely-used analytical models rely on questionable assumptions, including: $i)$ integrating over the density PDF, a one-point statistical description that ignores spatial correlation, $ii)$ selecting self-gravitating gas based on a density threshold that often ignores turbulent dispersion, $iii)$ assuming the freefall time as the timescale for estimating SFR without considering the need to rejuvenate the density PDF, $iv)$ assuming the density PDF to be lognormal. Improving upon the only existing model that incorporates the spatial correlation of the density field, we present a new analytical model. We calculate the time needed to rejuvenate density fluctuations of a given density and spatial scale, revealing that it is generally much longer than the freefall time, rendering the latter inappropriate for use. We make specific predictions regarding the role of the Mach number, $ M $, and the driving scale of turbulence divided by the mean Jeans length. At low to moderate Mach numbers, turbulence does not reduce and may even slightly promote star formation by broadening the PDF. However, at higher Mach numbers, most density fluctuations are stabilized by turbulent dispersion, leading to a steep drop in the SFR as the Mach number increases.

 - **Abstract**
 The identification of extragalactic fast optical transients (eFOTs) as potential multi-messenger sources is one of the main challenges in time-domain astronomy. However, recent developments have allowed for probes of rapidly-evolving transients. With the increasing number of alert streams from optical time-domain surveys, the next paradigm is building technologies to rapidly identify the most interesting transients for follow-up. One effort to make this possible is the fitting of objects to a variety of eFOT lightcurve models such as kilonovae and $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) afterglows. In this work, we describe a new framework designed to efficiently fit transients to light curve models and flag them for further follow-up. We describe the pipeline's workflow and a handful of performance metrics, including the nominal sampling time for each model. We highlight as examples ZTF20abwysqy, the shortest long gamma ray burst discovered to date, and ZTF21abotose, a core-collapse supernova initially identified as a potential kilonova candidate.

 - **Abstract**
 Mercury is notoriously difficult to form in solar system simulations, due to its small mass and iron-rich composition. Smooth particle hydrodynamics simulations of collisions have found that a Mercury-like body could be formed by one or multiple giant impacts, but due to the chaotic nature of collisions it is difficult to create a scenario where such impacts will take place. Recent work has found more success forming Mercury analogues by adding additional embryos near Mercury's orbit. In this work, we aim to form Mercury by simulating the formation of the solar system in the presence of the giant planets Jupiter and Saturn. We test out the effect of an inner disk of embryos added on to the commonly-used narrow annulus of initial material. We form Mercury analogues with core-mass fractions (CMF) $> 0.4$ in $\sim 10\%$ of our simulations, and twice that number of Mercury analogues form during the formation process, but are unstable and do not last to the end of the simulations. Mercury analogues form at similar rates for both disks with and without an inner component, and most of our Mercury analogues have lower CMF than that of Mercury, $\sim 0.7$, due to significant accretion of debris material. We suggest that a more in-depth understanding of the fraction of debris mass that is lost to collisional grinding is necessary to understand Mercury's formation, or some additional mechanism is required to stop this debris from accreting.
#### [OI] fine structure line profiles in Mon R2 and M17 SW: the puzzling  nature of cold foreground material identified by [12CII] self-absorption

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Recent studies of the optical depth comparing [12CII] and [13CII] line profiles in Galactic star-forming regions revealed strong self-absorption in [12CII] by low excitation foreground material, implying a large column density of C+ corresponding to an equivalent AV of a few, up to about 10 mag. Aims. As the nature and origin of such a large column of cold C+ foreground gas are difficult to explain, it is essential to constrain the physical conditions of this material. Methods. We conducted high-resolution observations of [OI] 63 um and [OI] 145 um lines in M17 SW and Mon R2. The [OI] 145 um transition traces warm PDR-material, while the [OI] 63 um line traces foreground material as manifested by absorption dips. Results. Comparison of both [OI] line profiles with [CII] isotopic lines confirms warm PDR-origin background emission and a significant column of cold foreground material causing self-absorption visible in [12CII] and [OI] 63 um profiles. In M17 SW, the C+ and O column densities are comparable for both layers. Mon R2 exhibits larger O columns compared to C+, indicating additional material where the carbon is neutral or in molecular form. Small-scale spatial variation of the foreground absorption profiles and the large column density (around 1E18 cm-2 ) of the foreground material suggest emission from high-density regions associated with the cloud complex, not a uniform diffuse foreground cloud. Conclusions. The analysis confirms that the previously detected intense [CII] foreground absorption is attributable to a large column of low excitation dense atomic material, where carbon is ionized, and oxygen is in neutral atomic form.

 - **Abstract**
 Gaia BH3 is the first observed dormant black hole (BH) with a mass of $\approx{30}$ M$_\odot$ and represents the first confirmation that such massive BHs are associated with metal-poor stars. Here, we explore the isolated binary formation channel for Gaia BH3 focusing on the old and metal-poor stellar population of the Milky Way halo. We use our open-source population synthesis code SEVN to evolve $3.2 \times 10^8$ binaries exploring 16 sets of parameters. We find that systems like Gaia BH3 form preferentially from binaries initially composed of a massive star ($40-60$ M$_\odot$) and a low mass companion ($<1$ M$_\odot$) in a wide ($P>10^3$ days) and eccentric orbit ($e>0.6$). Such progenitors do not undergo any Roche-lobe overflow episode during their entire evolution, so that the final orbital properties of the BH-star system are essentially determined at the core collapse of the primary star. Low natal kicks ($\approx$ 10~km/s) significantly favour the formation of Gaia BH3-like systems, but high velocity kicks up to $\approx 220$ km/s are also allowed. We estimate the formation efficiency for Gaia BH3-like systems in old ($t>10$ Gyr) and metal-poor ($Z<0.01$) populations to be $4 \times 10^{-8}$ M$_\odot^{-1}$, representing $\approx 3\%$ of the whole simulated BH-star population. We expect up to $\sim 3000$ BH-star systems in the Galactic halo formed through isolated evolution, of which $\sim 100$ are compatible with Gaia BH3 alike. Gaia BH3-like systems represent a common product of isolated binary evolution at low metallicity ($Z<0.01$), but given the steep density profile of the Galactic halo we do not expect more than one in the halo at the observed distance of Gaia BH3. Considering the estimated formation efficiency for both the isolated and dynamical formation channel, we conclude that they are almost equally likely to explain the origin of Gaia BH3.
