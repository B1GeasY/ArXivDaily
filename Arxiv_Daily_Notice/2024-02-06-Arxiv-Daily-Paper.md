 - **Abstract**
 Substructures in disc density are ubiquitous in the bright extended discs that are observed with high resolution. These substructures are intimately linked to the physical mechanisms driving planet formation and disc evolution. Surveys of star-forming regions find that most discs are in fact compact, less luminous, and do not exhibit these same substructures. It remains unclear whether compact discs also have similar substructures or if they are featureless. This suggests that different planet formation and disc evolution mechanisms operate in these discs. We investigated evidence of substructure within two compact discs around the stars Sz 65 and Sz 66 using high angular resolution observations with ALMA at 1.3 mm. The two stars form a wide-binary system with 6.36 arcsec separation. The continuum observations achieve a synthesised beam major axis of 0.026 arcsec, equivalent to about 4.0 au, enabling a search for substructure on these spatial scales and a characterisation of the gas and dust disc sizes with high precision. We analysed the data in the image plane through an analysis of reconstructed images, as well as in the uv plane by modelling the visibilities and by an analysis of the 12CO emission line. Comparisons were made with high-resolution observations of compact discs and radially extended discs. We find evidence of substructure in the dust distribution of Sz 65, namely a shallow gap centred at approximately 20 au, with an emission ring exterior to it. Ninety percent of the measured continuum flux is found within 27 au, and the distance for 12CO is 161 au. The observations show that Sz 66 is very compact: 90 per cent of the continuum flux is contained within 16 au, and 64 au for the gas. While the overall prevalence and diversity of substructure in compact discs relative to larger discs is yet to be determined, we find evidence that substructures can exist in compact discs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present resolved images of IRAS 23077+6707 in $1.3\,\mathrm{mm}$/$225\,\mathrm{GHz}$ thermal dust and CO gas emission with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and $grizy$ optical scattered light with the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS). The Pan-STARRS data show a bipolar distribution of optically scattering dust that is characteristic for disks observed at high inclinations. Its radial extent in scattered light emission spans $\sim12''$, with two highly asymmetric filaments extending along the upper bounds of each nebula by $\sim9''$. The SMA data measure $1.3\,\mathrm{mm}$ continuum dust as well as $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O $J$=2$-$1 line emission over $11''$-$16''$ extents, with the gas presenting the typical morphology of a disk in Keplerian rotation, in both position-velocity space and in each CO line spectra. IRAS 23077+6707 has no reported distance estimate, but if it is located in the Cepheus star-forming region ($180$-$800\,\mathrm{pc}$), it would have a radius spanning thousands of au. Taken together, we infer IRAS 23077+6707 to be a giant and gas-rich edge-on protoplanetary disk, which to our knowledge is the largest in extent so far discovered.

 - **Abstract**
 The color index $(J-K)_0$ of tip-red giant branch (TRGB) is used to study the metallicity distribution in the Large and Small Magellanic Cloud. With the most complete and pure sample of red member stars so far, the areas are divided into 154 and 70 bins for the LMC and SMC respectively with similar number of stars by the Voronoi binning. For each bin, the position of TRGB on the near-infrared color-magnitude diagram, specifically $(J-K)_0/K_0$, is determined by the Poison-Noise weighted method. Converting the color index of TRGB into metallicity, the metallicity gradients in the LMC and the SMC are obtained in four major directions. For the LMC, the gradient to the north is $-0.006 \pm 0.004$ dex kpc$^{-1}$, to the south $-0.010 \pm 0.005$ dex kpc$^{-1}$, to the east $-0.006 \pm 0.003$ dex kpc$^{-1}$, and to the west $-0.010 \pm 0.003$ dex kpc$^{-1}$. The farthest distance extends to 16 kpc. For the SMC, the gradients to the north, south, east, and west are $-0.017 \pm 0.031$ dex kpc$^{-1}$, $-0.016 \pm 0.007$ dex kpc$^{-1}$, $-0.003 \pm 0.002$ dex kpc$^{-1}$, and $-0.004 \pm 0.003$ dex kpc$^{-1}$, respectively. The farthest distance for the SMC extends to 27 kpc. The gradient is large from the center to 1 kpc.

 - **Abstract**
 Fan-spine magnetic structure, as a fundamental three-dimensional topology in magnetic reconnection theory, plays a crucial role in producing solar jets. However, how fan-spine configurations form in the solar atmosphere remains elusive. Using the Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar Explorer (CHASE) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we present a case study on the complete buildup of fan-spine topology driven by flux emergence and the subsequent jet production. Two fan-spine structures and the two associated null points are present. Variations in null-point heights and locations were tracked over time during flux emergence. The north fan-spine structure is found to be created through magnetic reconnection between the newly emerged flux and the background field. Gentle reconnection persistently occurs after formation of the north fan-spine structure, resulting in weak plasma outflows. Subsequently, as flux emergence and magnetic helicity injection continue, the formation and eruption of mini-filaments after reconnection at the quasi-separatrix layer between the two nulls trigger three homologous jets. The CHASE observations reveal that the circular flare ribbon, inner bright patch, and remote brightening all exhibit redshifted signatures during these jet ejections. This work unveils the key role of flux emergence in the formation of fan-spine topology, and highlights the importance of mini-filaments for subsequent jet production.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, combining high-contrast imaging and space astrometry we found that Jupiter-like (JL) planets are frequent in the beta Pic moving group (BPMG) around those stars where their orbit can be stable, prompting further analysis and discussion. We broaden our previous analysis to other young nearby associations to determine the frequency, mass, and separation of companions in general and JL in particular and their dependencies on the mass and age of the associations. We collected available data about companions including those revealed by visual observations, eclipses, spectroscopy, and astrometry. We determined search completeness and found that it is very high for stellar companions, while completeness corrections are still large for JL companions. Once these corrections are included, we found a high frequency of companions, both stellar (>0.52+/-0.03) and JL (0.57+/-0.11). The two populations are separated by a gap that corresponds to the brown dwarf desert. Within the population of massive companions, we found trends in frequency, separation, and mass ratios with stellar mass. Planetary companions pile up in the region just outside the ice line and we found them to be frequent once completeness was considered. The frequency of JL planets decreases with the overall mass and possibly the age of the association. We tentatively identify the two populations as due to disk fragmentation and core accretion, respectively. The distributions of stellar companions with a semi-major axis <1000 au is well reproduced by a simple model of formation by disk fragmentation. The observed trends with stellar mass can be explained by a shorter but much more intense phase of accretion onto the disk of massive stars and by a more steady and prolonged accretion on solar-type stars. Possible explanations for the trends in the population of JL planets with association mass and age are briefly discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Propagating streamer blobs could be an important source of disturbances in the solar wind. Direct observations on formation of streamer blobs could be a proxy for understanding the formation of small-scale structures and disturbances in the solar wind. Aims. We aim to investigate how a streamer blob is formed before it is observed in the outer corona. Methods. Usingspecialcoordinated-observationsfromSOHO/LASCO,GOES/SUVIandSDO/AIA, we study the precursors of a streamer blob as seen in the corona below 2.0 solar radii (Rs). Results. We found that the streamer blob was formed due to the gradual merging of three clumps of brightenings initiated from the lower corona at about 1.8Rs, which is likely driven by expansion of the loop system at the base of the streamer. The acceleration of the blob starts from 1.9Rs or lower. It propagates along the south flank of the streamer where an expanding elongated brightening occurs coincidently. Conclusions. Our observations demonstrate that formation of a streamer blob is a complex process. We suggest that the expansion of the loop results in a pinching-off flux-rope-like blob at the loop apex below 2Rs. When the blob moves outward, it can be transferred across the overlying loops through interchange/component magnetic reconnection and then is released into the open field system. When the blob moves toward open field lines, interchange magnetic reconnections might also occur, and that can accelerate the plasma blob intermittently whilst allow it to transfer across the open field lines. Such dynamics in a streamer blob might further trigger small-scale disturbances in the solar wind such as switchbacks in the inner heliosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Young Stellar Objects (YSO) are newly formed stars from molecular clouds. They stay close to where they were born and serve as good tracers to study gas and star formation. During cloud evolution, young massive stars can disrupt the surrounding gas through stellar feedback, changing the gas distribution. We study the distribution of the gas around a sample of YSO associations located at $d \lesssim 3.5 \;\rm kpc$ from the Sun by comparing the location and morphology between $^{12}$CO (J = 1$-$0) emission, Planck 870 $\mu$m maps and YSO associations. Based on the spatial distribution of the gas compared to that of the YSOs, we classify the YSO associations into six types: direct, close, bubble, complex, diffuse, and clean associations. The complex associations are large structures consisting of both gas-rich and gas-poor segments. We study the velocity dispersion-size relation toward different association types. From the ratio between different types, we estimate a feedback time of $\approx$ 1.7 Myr in the solar neighborhood. The sample sets a solid foundation to explore the relationship between interstellar medium evolution, star formation, and Galaxy structure.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on X-ray polarization measurements of the extra-galactic Crab-like PSR B0540-69 and its Pulsar Wind Nebula (PWN) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), using a ~850 ks Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) exposure. The PWN is unresolved by IXPE. No statistically significant polarization is detected for the image-averaged data, giving a 99% confidence polarization upper limit (MDP99) of 5.3% in 2-8 keV energy range. However, a phase-resolved analysis detects polarization for both the nebula and pulsar in the 4-6 keV energy range. For the PWN defined as the off-pulse phases, the polarization degree (PD) of (24.5 ${\pm}$ 5.3)% and polarization angle (PA) of (78.1 ${\pm}$ 6.2){\deg} is detected at 4.6${\sigma}$ significance level, consistent with the PA observed in the optical band. In a single on-pulse window, a hint of polarization is measured at 3.8${\sigma}$ with polarization degree of (50.0 ${\pm}$ 13.1)% and polarization angle of (6.2 ${\pm}$ 7.4){\deg}. A 'simultaneous' PSR/PWN analysis finds two bins at the edges of the pulse exceeding 3${\sigma}$ PD significance, with PD of (68 ${\pm}$ 20)% and (62 ${\pm}$ 20)%; intervening bins at 2-3${\sigma}$ significance have lower PD, hinting at additional polarization structure.

 - **Abstract**
 The young stellar source HH 30 is a textbook example of an ionic optical jet originating from a disk in an edge-on system shown by the HST. It has a remnant envelope in $^{12}$CO observed by ALMA. The optical jet is characterized by its narrow appearance, large line width at the base, and high temperature inferred from line diagnostics. Three featured structures can be identified, most evident in the transverse position--velocity diagrams: an extremely--high-velocity (EHV) wide-angle wind component with large spectral widths in the optical, a very--low-velocity (VLV) ambient surrounding medium seen in $^{12}$CO, and a low-velocity (LV) region traced by $^{12}$CO nested both in velocity and location between the primary wind and ambient environment. A layered cavity with multiple shells forms nested morphological and kinematic structures around the optical jet. The atomic gas originating from the innermost region of the disk attains a sufficient temperature and ionization to emit brightly in forbidden lines as an optical jet. The wide-angle portion expands, forming a low-density cavity. The filamentary $^{12}$CO encompassing the wind cavity is mixed and advected inward through the action of the magnetic interplay of the wide-angle wind with the molecular ambient medium. The magnetic interplay results in the layered shells penetrating deeply into the vast cavity of tenuous atomic wind material. The HH 30 system is an ideal manifestation of the unified wind model of \citet{Shang_2020,Shang_2023}, with clearly distinguishable atomic and molecular species mixed through the atomic lightly ionized magnetized wind and the surrounding cold molecular ambient material.

 - **Abstract**
 DG Tau is a nearby T Tauri star associated with a collimated jet, a circumstellar disk and a streamer a few hundred au long. The streamer connects to the disk at $\sim$50 au from DG Tau. At this location SO emission is observed, likely due to the release of sulphur from dust grains caused by the shock of the impact of the accretion streamer onto the disk. We investigate the possibility that the DG Tau streamer was produced via cloudlet capture on the basis of hydrodynamic simulations, considering a cloudlet initiating infall at 600 au from DG Tau with low angular momentum so that the centrifugal force is smaller than the gravitational force, even at 50 au. The elongation of the cloudlet into a streamer is caused by the tidal force when its initial velocity is much less than the free-fall velocity. The elongated cloudlet reaches the disk and forms a high density gas clump. Our hydrodynamic model reproduces the morphology and line-of-sight velocity of CS ($5-4$) emission from the Northern streamer observed with ALMA. We discuss the conditions for forming a streamer based on the simulations. We also show that the streamer should perturb the disk after impact for several thousands of years.
#### Comprehensive study of magnetic field evolution in relativistic jets  based on 2D simulations

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02737
 - **Abstract**
 We use two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations to investigate the generation and evolution of the magnetic field associated with the propagation of a jet for various initial conditions. We demonstrate that, in general, the magnetic field is initially grown by the Weibel and Mushroom instabilities. However, the field is saturated by the Alfv'en current limit. For initially non-magnetized plasma, we show that the growth of the magnetic field is delayed when the matter density of the jet environment is lower, which are in agreement with simple analytical predictions. We show that the higher Lorentz factor ($\gtrsim 2$) prevents rapid growth of the magnetic fields. When the initial field is troidal, the position of the magnetic filaments moves away from the jet as the field strength increases. The axial initial field helps the jet maintain its shape more effectively than the troidal initial field.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-peaked supernovae with precursors, dramatic light-curve rebrightenings, and spectral transformation are rare, but are being discovered in increasing numbers by modern night-sky transient surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Here, we present the observations and analysis of SN 2023aew, which showed a dramatic increase in brightness following an initial luminous (-17.4 mag) and long (~100 days) unusual first peak (possibly precursor). SN 2023aew was classified as a Type IIb supernova during the first peak but changed its type to resemble a stripped-envelope supernova (SESN) after the marked rebrightening. We present comparisons of SN 2023aew's spectral evolution with SESN subtypes and argue that it is similar to SNe Ibc during its main peak. P-Cygni Balmer lines are present during the first peak, but vanish during the second peak's photospheric phase, before H$\alpha$ resurfaces again during the nebular phase. The nebular lines ([O I], [Ca II], Mg I], H$\alpha$) exhibit a double-peaked structure which hints towards a clumpy or non-spherical ejecta. We analyze the second peak in the light curve of SN 2023aew and find it to be broader than normal SESNe as well as requiring a very high $^{56}$Ni mass to power the peak luminosity. We discuss the possible origins of SN 2023aew including an eruption scenario where a part of the envelope is ejected during the first peak which also powers the second peak of the light curve through SN-CSM interaction.

 - **Abstract**
 The understanding of neutron star equation of state hinges on a comprehensive analysis of multi-messenger, multi-wavelength data. The recent scrutiny of PSR J0030+0451 data by NICER introduces complexities, unveiling a tension with another X-ray observation of the central compact object in HESS J1731-347, specifically concerning the mass-radius constraint of low-mass neutron stars. This tension persists when integrating NICER's updated data with LIGO/Virgo's gravitational-wave data from the GW170817 binary neutron star merger. Despite attempts to reconcile these disparate observations, the current combined data still can not distinguish different types of neutron stars -- whether they are pure neutron stars or hybrid stars. Bayesian inference indicates only modest changes in the posterior ranges of parameters related to the nuclear matter and deconfinement phase transition. This ongoing exploration underscores the intricate challenges in precisely characterizing neutron stars. It also points out that it is possible to probe the equation of state at different density regimes from future more accurate radii of neutron stars with various masses.

 - **Abstract**
 To understand physical properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) on various scales, we investigate it at parsec resolution on the kiloparsec scale. Here, we report on the sub-kpc scale Gas Density Histogram (GDH) of the Milky Way. The GDH is a density probability distribution function (PDF) of the gas volume density. Using this method, we are free from an identification of individual molecular clouds and their spatial structures. We use survey data of $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO ($J$=1-0) emission in the Galactic plane ($l = 10^{\circ}$-$50^{\circ}$) obtained as a part of the FOREST Unbiased Galactic plane Imaging survey with the Nobeyama 45m telescope (FUGIN). We make a GDH for every channel map of $2^{\circ} \times 2^{\circ}$ area, including the blank sky component, and without setting cloud boundaries. This is a different approach from previous works for molecular clouds. The GDH fits well to a single or double log-normal distribution, which we name the low-density log-normal (L-LN) and high-density log-normal (H-LN) components, respectively. The multi-log-normal components suggest that the L-LN and H-LN components originate from two different stages of structure formation in the ISM. Moreover, we find that both the volume ratios of H-LN components to total ($f_{\mathrm{H}}$) and the width of the L-LN along the gas density axis ($\sigma_{\rm{L}}$) show coherent structure in the Galactic-plane longitude-velocity diagram. It is possible that these GDH parameters are related to strong galactic shocks and other weak shocks in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the ionised and atomic gas kinematics and excitation state in the central region of ongoing star formation of the nearby low-metallicity dwarf galaxy Sextans B. The analysis is based on the new observations performed in Ha emission line with high resolution ($R \sim 16000$) scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer at the 6-m BTA SAO RAS telescope, and on the long-slit spectral observations at the 9.2-m SALT and 2.5-m CMO SAI MSU telescopes. Strong non-circular gas motions detected in the studied regions probably resulted from the off-plane gas motions and impact of stellar feedback. We identified six regions of elevated Ha velocity dispersion, five of which exhibit asymmetric or two-component Ha line profiles. Three of these regions are young ($<1.1$ Myr) expanding ($V_{\rm exp} \sim 25-50\ {\rm km\ s^{-1}}$) superbubbles. We argue that at least three regions in the galaxy could be supernova remnants. We conclude that supernovae feedback is the dominant source of energy for superbubbles in Sextans B, which is expected for such a low metallicity, although we cannot rule out a strong impact of pre-supernova feedback for one superbubble.
#### Angular Momentum Transport in Binary Star Formation: The Enhancement of  Magneto-Rotational Instability and Role of Outflows

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of binary stars is highly influenced by magnetic fields, which play a crucial role in transporting angular momentum. We conducted three-dimensional numerical simulations of binary star accretion via a circumbinary disk, taking into account a magnetic field perpendicular to the disk and an infalling envelope. Our simulations reproduce the following phenomena: (1) spiral arms associated with circumstellar disks, (2) turbulence in the circumbinary disk, induced by magneto-rotational instability (MRI), (3) a fast outflow launched from each circumstellar disk, and (4) a slow outflow from the circumbinary disk. The binary models exhibit a higher $\alpha$-parameter than the corresponding single star models, indicating that the binary stars enhance MRI turbulence. Moreover, an infalling envelope also enhance the turbulence, leading to a high $\alpha$-parameter. While the spiral arms promotes radial flow, causing transfer of mass and angular momentum within the circumbinary disk, the MRI turbulence and outflows are main drivers of angular momentum transfer to reduce the specific angular momentum of the system.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a comprehensive spectroscopic analysis of the nova RS Ophiuchi during its quiescent stage, spanning a duration of approximately 13 years. The spectra exhibit prominent low-ionization emission features, including hydrogen, helium, iron, and TiO absorption features originating from the cool secondary component. The CLOUDY photoionization code is employed to model these spectra, allowing us to estimate various physical parameters such as temperature, luminosity, and hydrogen density, along with elemental abundances and accretion rate. The central ionizing sources exhibit temperatures in the range of $1.05 - 1.8~\times 10^4$ K and luminosities between $0.1 - 7.9~\times 10^{30}$ \ergs. Notably, \ion{He}{} displays an overabundance from 2008 to 2016, returning to solar values by 2020, while \ion{Fe}{} appears subsolar from 2008 to 2014 but becomes overabundant from 2006 onward. The mean accretion rate, as calculated from the model, is approximately $1.254 \times 10^{-8} M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. About 47\% of the critical mass was accreted after April, 2020 ($\sim$15 months before the 2021 outburst), and approximately 88\% of the critical mass was accreted after July 20, 2018. This non-uniform accretion rate suggests a more rapid approach towards reaching the critical mass in the final years, possibly attributed to the heightened gravitational pull resulting from previously accreted matter, influencing the accretion dynamics as the system approaches the critical mass limit.
