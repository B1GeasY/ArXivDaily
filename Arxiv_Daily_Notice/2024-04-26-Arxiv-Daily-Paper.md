#### Spinning solar jets explained through the interplay between plasma  sheets and vortex columns
 - **Authors:** Sahel Dey, Piyali Chatterjee, Robertus Erdelyi
 - **Subjects:** Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

 - **Abstract**
 Bunches of swaying and spinning plasma jets in the solar atmosphere - the spicules - exhibit a variety of complex dynamics that are clearly observed in the images of the solar limb. Utilizing three-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamics (rMHD) simulation data, we uncover another facet of a forest of spicules that turns out to be a manifestation of the two-dimensional plasma drapery, instead of one-dimensional conical spikes. This fluted morphology is observed in other contexts like molecular clouds, auroras, and coronal loops. Further, using a sequence of high-cadence line-of-sight integrated images, generated from our simulation, we obtain multiple episodes of spinning amongst clusters of synthetic spicules, also reported in observations near the solar limb. This perception of rotation, according to our findings, is associated with hot swirling plasma columns, extending to coronal heights - that we label as coronal swirling conduits (CoSCo).
#### Detectability of Surface Biosignatures for Directly-Imaged Rocky  Exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 Modeling the detection of life has never been more opportune. With next generation space telescopes, like the currently developing Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) concept, we will begin to characterize rocky exoplanets potentially similar to Earth. However, currently, few realistic planetary spectra containing surface biosignatures have been paired with direct imaging telescope instrument models. Therefore, we use a HWO instrument noise model to assess the detection of surface biosignatures affiliated with oxygenic, anoxygenic, and nonphotosynthetic extremophiles. We pair the HWO telescope model to a 1-D radiative transfer model to estimate the required exposure times necessary for detecting each biosignature on planets with global microbial coverage and varying atmospheric water vapor concentrations. For modeled planets with 0% - 50% cloud coverage, we determine pigments and the red edge could be detected within 1,000 hours (100 hours) at distances within 15 pc (11 pc). However, tighter telescope inner working angles (2.5 lambda/D) would allow surface biosignature detection at further distances. Anoxygenic photosynthetic biosignatures could also be more easily detectable than nonphotosynthetic pigments and the photosynthetic red edge when compared against a false positive iron oxide slope. Future life detection missions should evaluate the influence of false positives on the detection of multiple surface biosignatures.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a JWST imaging survey with NIRCam and MIRI of NGC 346, the brightest star-forming region in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). By combining aperture and point spread function (PSF) photometry of eleven wavelength bands across these two instruments, we have detected more than 200,000 unique sources. Using near-infrared (IR) color analysis, we observe various evolved and young populations, including 196 young stellar objects (YSOs) and pre-main sequence stars suitable for forthcoming spectroscopic studies. We expand upon this work, creating mid-IR color-magnitude diagrams and determining color cuts to identify 833 reddened sources which are YSO candidates. We observe that these candidate sources are spatially associated with regions of dusty, filamentary nebulosity. Furthermore, we fit model YSO spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to a selection of sources with detections across all of our MIRI bands. We classify with a high degree of confidence 23 YSOs in this sample and estimate their radii, bolometric temperatures, luminosities, and masses. We detect YSOs approaching 1 solar mass, the lowest-mass extragalactic YSOs confirmed to date.

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are known for their long-term stability. Using six years of observations from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), we have conducted an in-depth analysis of the X-ray timing results for six MSPs: PSRs B1937+21, B1821$-$24, J0437$-$4715, J0030+0451, J0218+4232, and J2124$-$3358. The timing stability parameter $\sigma_z$ has been calculated, revealing remarkable timing precision on the order of $10^{-14}$ for PSRs B1937+21 and J0437$-$4715, and $10^{-13}$ for PSRs B1821$-$24, J0218+4232, and J0030+0451 over a timescale of 1000 days. These findings underscore the feasibility of autonomous in-orbit timekeeping using X-ray observations of MSPs. In addition, the consistency of long-term spin-down noise in the X-ray and radio bands has been investigated by comparison with IPTA radio data.
#### Measurement of Interstellar Magnetization by Synchrotron Polarization  Variance

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16310
 - **Abstract**
 Since synchrotron polarization fluctuations are related to the fundamental properties of the magnetic field, we propose the polarization intensity variance to measure the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) magnetization. We confirm the method's applicability by comparing it with the polarization angle dispersion and its reliability by measuring the underlying Alfv\'enic Mach number of MHD turbulence. With the finding of the power-law relation of $\mathcal{A} \propto M_{\rm A}^{2}$ between polarization intensity variance $\mathcal{A}$ and Alfv\'enic Mach number $M_{\rm A}$, we apply the new technique to the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS) data, achieving Alfv\'enic Mach number of the Galactic ISM. Our results show that the low-latitude Galactic ISM is dominated by sub-Alf\'enic turbulence, with $M_{\rm A}$ approximately between 0.5 and 1.0.

 - **Abstract**
 Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to originate from core collapse of massive stars. High-redshift GRBs can probe the star formation and reionization history of the early universe, but their detection remains rare. Here we report the detection of a GRB triggered in the 0.5--4 keV band by the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) on board the Einstein Probe (EP) mission, designated as EP240315a, whose bright peak was also detected by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope and Konus-Wind through off-line analyses. At a redshift of $z=4.859$, EP240315a showed a much longer and more complicated light curve in the soft X-ray band than in gamma-rays. Benefiting from a large field-of-view ($\sim$3600 deg$^2$) and a high sensitivity, EP-WXT captured the earlier engine activation and extended late engine activity through a continuous detection. With a peak X-ray flux at the faint end of previously known high-$z$ GRBs, the detection of EP240315a demonstrates the great potential for EP to study the early universe via GRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 The first stars might have been fast rotators. This would have important consequences for their radiative, mechanical and chemical feedback. We discuss the impact of fast initial rotation on the evolution of massive Population III models and on their nitrogen and oxygen stellar yields. We explore the evolution of Population III stars with initial masses in the range of 9Msol < Mini < 120Msol starting with an initial rotation on the Zero Age Main Sequence equal to 70% of the critical one. We find that with the physics of rotation considered here, our rapidly-rotating Population III stellar models do not follow a homogeneous evolution. They lose very little mass in case mechanical winds are switched on when the surface rotation becomes equal or larger than the critical velocity. Impact on the ionising flux appears modest when compared to moderately-rotating models. Fast rotation favours, in models with initial masses above ~20Msol, the appearance of a very extended intermediate convective zone around the H-burning shell during the core He-burning phase. This shell has important consequences on the sizes of the He- and CO-cores and thus impacts the final fate of stars. Moreover, it has a strong impact on nucleosynthesis boosting the production of primary 14N. Fast initial rotation impacts significantly the chemical feedback of Population III stars. Observations of extremely metal-poor stars and/or starbursting regions are essential to provide constraints on the properties of the first stars.
