 - **Abstract**
 We present the first comprehensive analysis of the argon K-edge absorption region (3.1-4.2 Å) using high-resolution HETGS {\it Chandra} spectra of 33 low-mas X-ray binaries. Utilizing R-matrix theory, we computed new K photoabsorption cross-sections for {\rm Ar}~{\sc i}--{\rm Ar}~{\sc xvi} species. For each X-ray source, we estimated column densities for the {\rm Ar}~{\sc i}, {\rm Ar}~{\sc ii}, {\rm Ar}~{\sc iii}, {\rm Ar}~{\sc xvi}, {\rm Ar}~{\sc xvii} and {\rm Ar}~{\sc xviii} ions, which trace the neutral, warm and hot components of the gaseous Galactic interstellar medium. We examined their distribution as a function of Galactic latitude, longitude, and distances to the sources. However, no significant correlations were discerned among distances, Galactic latitude, or longitude. Future X-ray observatories will allow us to benchmark the atomic data as the main resonance lines will be resolved.

 - **Abstract**
 While the nitrile group is by far the most prevalent one among interstellar molecules, the existence of interstellar dinitriles (molecules containing two -CN groups) has recently been proven. Here we report the discovery of two new dinitriles in the cold dense cloud TMC-1. These newly identified species are malononitrile, CH2(CN)2, and maleonitrile, the Z isomer of NC-CH=CH-CN, which can be seen as the result of substituting two H atoms with two -CN groups in methane and ethylene, respectively. These two molecules were detected using data from the ongoing QUIJOTE line survey of TMC-1 that is being carried out with the Yebes 40m telescope. We derive column densities of 1.8e11 cm-2 and 5.1e10 cm-2 for malononitrile and maleonitrile, respectively. This means that they are eight and three times less abundant than HCC-CH2-CN and (E)-HCC-CH=CH-CN, respectively, which are analog molecules detected in TMC-1 in which one -CN group is converted into a -CCH group. This is in line with previous findings in which -CCH derivatives are more abundant than the -CN counterparts in TMC-1. We examined the potential chemical pathways to these two dinitriles, and we find that while maleonitrile can be efficiently formed through the reaction of CN with CH2CHCN, the formation of malononitrile is not clear because the neutral-neutral reactions that could potentially form it are not feasible under the physical conditions of TMC-1.
#### FAST detection of OH emission in the carbon-rich planetary nebula NGC 7027

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first detection of the ground-state OH emission line at 1612 MHz toward the prototypical carbon-rich planetary nebula (PN) NGC 7027, utilizing the newly installed ultra-wideband (UWB) receiver of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). This emission is likely to originate from the interface of the neutral shell and the ionized region. The other three ground-state OH lines at 1665, 1667, and 1721 MHz are observed in absorption and have velocities well matched with that of HCO$^+$ absorption. We infer that the OH absorption is from the outer shell of NGC 7027, although the possibility that they are associated with a foreground cloud cannot be completely ruled out. All the OH lines exhibit a single blue-shifted component with respect to the central star. The formation of OH in carbon-rich environments might be via photodissociation-induced chemical processes. Our observations offer significant constraints for chemical simulations, and they underscore the potent capability of the UWB receiver of FAST to search for nascent PNe.
#### Exploring the range of impacts of helium in the spectra of double detonation models for Type Ia supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 In the double detonation scenario the ignition of a surface He detonation on a sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf leads to a secondary core detonation. Double detonation models have shown promise for explaining Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with a variety of luminosities. A key feature of such models is unburnt He in the ejecta, which can show significant variation in both its mass and velocity distribution. Many previous radiative transfer simulations for double detonation models have neglected treatment of non-thermal ionization and excitation, preventing them from robustly assessing whether He spectral features are expected to form. We present a non local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer simulation, including treatment for non-thermal electrons, for a double detonation model with a modest mass of He (${\sim}$0.04 M${\odot}$) ejected at reasonably low velocities (${\sim}$12000$\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). Despite our simulation predicting no clear optical He features, a strong and persistent He I 10830$\,Å$ absorption feature forms that is significantly blended with the spectral contribution of Mg II 10927$\,Å$. For some normal SNe Ia the Mg feature shows an extended blue wing, previously attributed to C I, however the simulated He feature shows its strongest absorption at wavelengths consistent with this wing. We therefore suggest this extended wing is instead a spectral signature of He. The He feature predicted by this particular model is too strong and persistent to be consistent with normal SNe Ia, however, this motivates further work to use this observable signature to test the parameter space for double detonation models.
#### Statistical properties of filaments in the cosmic web

 - **Abstract**
 In the context of the cosmological and constrained ELUCID simulation, this study explores the statistical characteristics of filaments within the cosmic web, focussing on aspects such as the distribution of filament lengths and their radial density profiles. Using the classification of the cosmic web environment through the Hessian matrix of the density field, our primary focus is on how cosmic structures react to the two variables $R_{\rm s}$ and $\lambda_{\rm th}$. The findings show that the volume fractions of knots, filaments, sheets, and voids are highly influenced by the threshold parameter $\lambda_{\rm th}$, with only a slight influence from the smoothing length $R_{\rm s}$. The central axis of the cylindrical filament is pinpointed using the medial-axis thinning algorithm of the COWS method. It is observed that median filament lengths tend to increase as the smoothing lengths increase. Analysis of filament length functions at different values of $R_{\rm s}$ indicates a reduction in shorter filaments and an increase in longer filaments as $R_{\rm s}$ increases, peaking around $2.5R_{\rm s}$. The study also shows that the radial density profiles of filaments are markedly affected by the parameters $R_{\rm s}$ and $\lambda_{\rm th}$, showing a valley at approximately $2R_{\rm s}$, with increases in the threshold leading to higher amplitudes of the density profile. Moreover, shorter filaments tend to have denser profiles than their longer counterparts.

 - **Abstract**
 The S255IR-SMA1 core contains the protostar NIRS3 with a mass of $\sim$20 M$_\odot$. Several years ago, the first burst of luminosity for massive protostars, caused by an episodic accretion event, was recorded here. We have been studying this object for a long time using various instruments, including ALMA. The general morphology and kinematics of this area have been investigated. Disk-shaped structures, jets and outflows have been identified and studied in detail. We recently observed this object with ALMA with a resolution an order of magnitude higher than previously achieved - about 15 milliarcseconds, which corresponds to about 25 AU. This paper presents new results from the analysis of these data together with observations in other bands. The new data show an inhomogeneous disk structure, an ionized region around the protostar, and the presence of a jet observed in the submillimeter continuum, consisting of individual knots, the orientation of which differs markedly from that on large scales. The submillimeter emission from the jet most likely represents bremsstrahlung from ionized gas. Based on observations of the lines of some molecules, the kinematics and physical characteristics of this region are discussed. Methanol maser emission associated with the jet is observed.
#### A Dust-Scattering Model for M1-92: A Revised Estimate of the Mass Distribution and Inclination

 - **Abstract**
 Preplanetary nebulae (PPNe) are formed from mass-ejecting late-stage AGB stars. Much of the light from the star gets scattered or absorbed by dust particles, giving rise to the observed reflection nebula seen at visible and near-IR wavelengths. Precursors to planetary nebulae (PNe), PPNe generally have not yet undergone any ionization by UV radiation from the still-buried stellar core. Bipolar PPNe are a common form of observed PPNe. This study lays the groundwork for future dynamical studies by reconstructing the dust density distribution of a particularly symmetric bipolar PPN, M1-92 (Minkowski's Footprint, IRAS 19343$+$2926). For this purpose, we develop an efficient single-scattering radiative transfer model with corrections for double-scattering. Using a V-band image from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we infer the dust density profile and orientation of M1-92. These results indicate that M1-92's slowly expanding equatorial torus exhibits an outer radial cutoff in its density, which implicates the influence of a binary companion during the formation of the nebula.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars play an important role in the Universe. Unlike low-mass stars, the formation of these objects located at great distances is still unclear. It is expected to be governed by some combination of self-gravity, turbulence, and magnetic fields. Our aim is to study of the chemical and physical conditions of dense clumps in several high-mass star-forming regions. We performed observations towards 5 high-mass star-forming regions (L1287, S187, S231, DR21(OH), NGC7538) with the IRAM 30 m telescope. We covered the 2-3 and 4 mm wavelength band and analyzed the lines of HCN, HNC, HCO$^+$, HC$_3$N, HNCO, OCS, CS, SiO, SO$_2$ and SO. Using astrodendro algorithm on the 850 $\mu$m dust emission data from the SCUBA Legacy catalogue, we identified dense gas clumps and determined their masses, H$_2$ column densities and sizes. Furthermore, the kinetic temperatures, molecular abundances and dynamical state were obtained. The Red Midcourse Space Experiment Source survey (RMS) was used to determine the clump types. We identified $\sim$20 clumps. We found no significant correlation between line width and size, but the linewidth-mass and mass-size relationships are strongly correlated. Virial analysis indicated that the clumps with HII regions and young stellar objects (YSOs) are gravitationally bound. Furthermore, it was suggested that significant magnetic fields provide additional support for clump stability. The molecular abundances decrease from YSOs to submm and HII regions.
