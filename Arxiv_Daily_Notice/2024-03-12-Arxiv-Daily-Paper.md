 - **Abstract**
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules have long been suggested to be present in the interstellar medium (ISM). Nevertheless, despite their expected ubiquity and sustained searching efforts, identifying specific interstellar PAH molecules from their infrared (IR) spectroscopy has so far been unsuccessful. However, due to its unprecedented sensitivity, the advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) may change this. Meanwhile, recent years have witnessed breakthroughs in detecting specific PAH molecules (e.g., indene, cyanoindene, and cyanonaphthalene) through their rotational lines in the radio frequencies. As JWST holds great promise for identifying specific PAH molecules in the ISM based on their vibrational spectra in the IR, in this work we model the vibrational excitation of indene, a molecule composed of a six-membered benzene ring fused with a five-membered cyclopentene ring, and calculate its IR emission spectra for a number of representative astrophysical regions. This will facilitate JWST to search for and identify indene in space through its vibrational bands and to quantitatively determine or place an upper limit on its abundance.

 - **Abstract**
 Super-puffs are planets with exceptionally low densities ($\rho \lesssim 0.1$~g~cm$^{-3}$) and core masses ($M_c \lesssim 5 M_\oplus$). Many lower-mass ($M_p\lesssim10M_\oplus$) super-puffs are expected to be unstable to catastrophic mass loss via photoevaporation and/or boil-off, whereas the larger gravitational potentials of higher-mass ($M_p\gtrsim10M_\oplus$) super-puffs should make them more stable to these processes. We test this expectation by studying atmospheric loss in the warm, higher-mass super-puff TOI-1420b ($M = 25.1M_\oplus$, $R = 11.9R_\oplus$, $\rho = 0.08$~g~cm$^{-3}$, $T_\mathrm{eq} = 960$~K). We observed one full transit and one partial transit of this planet using the metastable helium filter on Palomar/WIRC and found that the helium transits were $0.671\pm0.079\%$ (8.5$\sigma$) deeper than the TESS transits, indicating an outflowing atmosphere. We modeled the excess helium absorption using a self-consistent 1D hydrodynamics code to constrain the thermal structure of the outflow given different assumptions for the stellar XUV spectrum. These calculations then informed a 3D simulation which provided a good match to the observations with a modest planetary mass-loss rate of $10^{10.82}$~g~s$^{-1}$ ($M_p/\dot{M}\approx70$~Gyr). Super-puffs with $M_p\gtrsim10M_\oplus$, like TOI-1420b and WASP-107b, appear perfectly capable of retaining atmospheres over long timescales; therefore, these planets may have formed with the unusually large envelope mass fractions they appear to possess today. Alternatively, tidal circularization could have plausibly heated and inflated these planets, which would bring their envelope mass fractions into better agreement with expectations from core-nucleated accretion.
#### Damping Obliquities of Hot Jupiter Hosts by Resonance Locking

 - **Abstract**
 When orbiting hotter stars, hot Jupiters are often highly inclined relative to their host star equator planes. By contrast, hot Jupiters orbiting cooler stars are more aligned. Prior attempts to explain this correlation between stellar obliquity and effective temperature have proven problematic. We show how resonance locking -- the coupling of the planet's orbit to a stellar gravity mode (g mode) -- can solve this mystery. Cooler stars with their radiative cores are more likely to be found with g-mode frequencies increased substantially by core hydrogen burning. Strong frequency evolution in resonance lock drives strong tidal evolution; locking to an axisymmetric g mode damps semi-major axes, eccentricities, and as we show for the first time, obliquities. Around cooler stars, hot Jupiters evolve into spin-orbit alignment and avoid engulfment. Hotter stars lack radiative cores, and therefore preserve congenital spin-orbit misalignments. We focus on resonance locks with axisymmetric modes, supplementing our technical results with simple physical interpretations, and show that non-axisymmetric modes also damp obliquity.
#### A Framework to Calibrate a Semi-analytic Model of the First Stars and  Galaxies to the Renaissance Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We present a method that calibrates a semi-analytic model to the Renaissance Simulations, a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations with high-redshift galaxy formation. This approach combines the strengths of semi-analytic techniques and hydrodynamical simulations, enabling the extension to larger volumes and lower redshifts inaccessible to simulations due to computational expense. Using a sample of Renaissance star formation histories (SFHs) from an average density region of the Universe, we construct a four parameter prescription for metal-enriched star formation characterized by an initial bursty stage followed by a steady stage where stars are formed at constant efficiencies. Our model also includes a treatment of Population III star formation where a minimum halo mass and log-normal distribution of stellar mass are adopted to match the numerical simulations. Star formation is generally well reproduced for halos with masses $\lesssim$$10^{9} M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$. Between $11<z<25$ our model produces metal-enriched star formation rate densities (SFRDs) that typically agree with Renaissance within a factor of $\sim$2 for the average density region. Additionally, the total metal-enriched stellar mass only differs from Renaissance by about $10\%$ at $z \sim 11$. For regions that are either more overdense or rarefied not included in the calibration, we produce metal-enriched SFRDs that agree with Renaissance within a factor of $\sim$2 at high-$z$, but eventually differ by higher factors for later times. This is likely due to environmental dependencies not included in the model. Our star formation prescriptions can easily be adopted in other analytic or semi-analytic works to match our calibration to Renaissance.
#### The Asteroseismic Imprints of Mass Transfer: A Case Study of a Binary  Mass Gainer in the SPB Instability Strip

 - **Abstract**
 We present new simulations investigating the impact of mass transfer on the asteroseismic signals of slowly pulsating B stars. We use MESA to simulate the evolution of a binary star system and GYRE to compute the asteroseismic properties of the accretor star. We show that, compared to a single star of the same final mass, a star that has undergone accretion (of non-enriched material) has a significantly different internal structure, evident in both the hydrogen abundance profile and Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency profile. These differences result in significant changes in the observed period spacing patterns, implying that one may use this as a diagnostic to test whether a star's core has been rejuvenated as a result of accretion. We show that it is essential to consider the full multimodal posterior distributions when fitting stellar properties of mass-gainers to avoid drawing misleading conclusions. Even with these considerations, stellar ages will be significantly underestimated when assuming single star evolution for a mass-gainer. We find that future detectors with improved uncertainties would rule out single star models with the correct mass and central hydrogen fraction. Our proof of principle analysis demonstrates the need to further investigate the impact of binary interactions on stellar asteroseismic signals for a wide range of parameters, such as initial mass, amount of mass transferred and the age of the accretor star at the onset of mass transfer.
#### The XMM-Newton Line Emission Analysis Program (X-LEAP) II: The  Multi-scale Temperature Structures in the Milky Way Hot Gas

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents the multi-scale temperature structures in the Milky Way (MW) hot gas, as part of the XMM-Newton Line Emission Analysis Program (X-LEAP), surveying the O VII, O VIII, and Fe-L band emission features in the XMM-Newton archive. In particular, we define two temperature tracers, $I_{\rm OVIII}/I_{\rm OVII}$ (O87) and $I_{\rm FeL}/(I_{\rm OVII}+I_{\rm OVIII})$ (FeO). These two ratios cannot be explained simultaneously using single-temperature collisional ionization models, which indicates the need for multi-temperature structures in hot gas. In addition, we show three large-scale features in the hot gas: the eROSITA bubbles around the Galactic center (GC); the disk; and the halo. In the eROSITA bubbles, the observed line ratios can be explained by a log-normal temperature distribution with a median of $\log T/{\rm K} \approx 6.4$ and a scatter of $\sigma_T \approx 0.2$ dex. Beyond the bubbles, the line ratio dependence on the Galactic latitude suggests higher temperatures around the midplane of the MW disk. The scale height of the temperature variation is estimated to be $\approx$2 kpc assuming an average distance of $5$ kpc for the hot gas. The halo component is characterized by the dependence on the distance to the GC, showing a temperature decline from $\log\,T/{\rm K}\,\approx\, 6.3$ to $5.8$. Furthermore, we extract the auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions to investigate the small-scale structures. O87 and FeO ratios show a consistent auto-correlation scale of $\approx$$ 5^\circ$ (i.e., $\approx$$ 400$ pc at 5 kpc), which is consistent with expected physical sizes of X-ray bubbles associated with star-forming regions or supernova remnants. Finally, we examine the cross-correlation between the hot and UV-detected warm gas, and show an intriguing anti-correlation.

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted an all-sky imaging transient search with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA) data collected during the Perseid meteor shower in 2018. The data collection during the meteor shower was motivated to conduct a search for intrinsic radio emission from meteors below 60 MHz known as the meteor radio afterglows (MRAs). The data collected were calibrated and imaged using the core array to obtain lower angular resolution images of the sky. These images were input to a pre-existing LWA transient search pipeline to search for MRAs as well as cosmic radio transients. This search detected 5 MRAs and did not find any cosmic transients. We further conducted peeling of bright sources, near-field correction, visibility differencing and higher angular resolution imaging using the full array for these 5 MRAs. These higher angular resolution images were used to study their plasma emission structures and monitor their evolution as a function of frequency and time. With higher angular resolution imaging, we resolved the radio emission size scales to less than 1 km physical size at 100 km heights. The spectral index mapping of one of the long duration event showed signs of diffusion of plasma within the meteor trails. The unpolarized emission from the resolved radio components suggest resonant transition radiation as the possible radiation mechanism of MRAs.

 - **Abstract**
 In eclipsing X-ray binary systems, the direct X-ray emission is blocked by the companion star during the eclipse. We observe only reprocessed emission that contains clues about the environment of the compact object and its chemical composition, ionization levels, etc. We have found flares in some X-ray binaries during their eclipses. The study of eclipse flares provides additional clues regarding the size of the reprocessing region and helps distinguish between different components of the X-ray spectrum observed during the eclipse. In the archival data, we searched for flares during eclipses of high-mass X-ray binaries and found flares in three sources: Vela X-1, LMC X-4, and 4U 1700-37. Comparing spectral properties of the eclipse flare and non-flare data, we found changes in the power-law photon index in all three sources and multiple emission lines in Vela X-1 and 4U 1700-37. The fluxes of prominent emission lines showed a similar increase as the overall X-ray flux during the eclipse flare, suggesting the lines originate in the binary environment and not in the interstellar medium. We also observed a soft excess in 4U 1700-37 that remains unchanged during both eclipse flare and non-flare states. Our analysis suggests that this emission originates from the extremely thin shell of the stellar wind surrounding the photosphere of its companion star. The detection of short (100-200 seconds) count-rate doubling timescale in 4U 1700-37 and LMC X-4 indicates that the eclipse reprocessing occurs in a region larger than, but comparable to the size of the companion star.

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates accelerated cosmic expansion using the Viscous Modified Chaplygin Gas (VMMG) and Generalized Cosmic Chaplygin Gas (GCCM) within Horava-Lifshitz gravity. Our primary objective is to constrain essential cosmological parameters, such as the Hubble Parameter ($H_{0}$) and Sound Horizon ($r_{d}$). We incorporate recent datasets comprising 17 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation observations, 33 Cosmic Chronometer measurements, 40 Type Ia Supernovae data points, 24 quasar Hubble diagram data points, and 162 Gamma Ray Bursts data points. Additionally, we integrate the most recent determination of the Hubble constant (R22). Treating $r_{d}$ as a free parameter helps alleviate bias, enhance precision, and improve dataset compatibility. By simulating random correlations in the covariance matrix, errors are reduced. The obtained values of ($H_{0}$) and ($r_{d}$) are consistent with those from Planck and SDSS. Cosmography tests offer insights into the dynamics of both models, aiding our understanding of cosmological evolution. Statefinder diagnostics deepen our understanding of cosmic expansion dynamics and aid in distinguishing between different cosmological models. The $o_{m}$ Diagnostic test reveals that at late times, VMMG falls in the phantom region and GCCM falls in the phantom quintessence region. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) provide support for all models under consideration, indicating that each model offers a plausible explanation. Notably, the $\Lambda$CDM model emerges with the lowest AIC score, suggesting its relatively superior fit compared to others. Additionally, validation through the reduced $\chi_{\text{red}}^{2}$ statistic confirms satisfactory fits across all models, further reinforcing their credibility in explaining the observed data.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effect of a dark matter caustic passing through the Solar System. We find, confirming a previous result, that the Sun tracks the caustic surface for some time. We integrate numerically the equations of motion of the Sun and a comet for a large number of initial conditions and of caustic passage properties. We calculate the probability for the comet to escape the Solar System and the probability for it to fall within 50 A.U. of the Sun, given the initial semi-major axis and eccentricity of its orbit. We find that the average probability for a comet to fall within 50 A.U. of the Sun is of order $3 \cdot 10^{-4}$ and that comets which are initially at a distance larger than about $10^5$ A.U. have a probability of order one to be ejected from the Solar System.

 - **Abstract**
 Velocity fields of molecular clouds (MCs) can provide crucial information on the merger and split between clouds, as well as their internal kinematics and maintenance, energy injection and redistribution, even star formation within clouds. Using the CO spectral lines data from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) survey, we measure the relative velocities along the line of sight ($\Delta$V$_{\rm LOS}$) between $^{13}$CO structures within $^{12}$CO MCs. Emphasizing MCs with double and triple $^{13}$CO structures, we find that approximately 70$\%$ of $\Delta$V$_{\rm LOS}$ values are less than $\sim$ 1 km s$^{-1}$, and roughly 10$\%$ of values exceed 2 km s$^{-1}$, with a maximum of $\sim$ 5 km s$^{-1}$. Additionally, we compare $\Delta$V$_{\rm LOS}$ with the internal velocity dispersion of $^{13}$CO structures ($\sigma_{\rm ^{13}CO,in}$) and find that about 40$\%$ of samples in either double or triple regime display distinct velocity discontinuities, i.e. the relative velocities between $^{13}$CO structures are larger than the internal linewidths of $^{13}$CO structures. Among these 40$\%$ samples in the triple regime, 33$\%$ exhibit signatures of combinations through the two-body motion, whereas the remaining 7$\%$ show features of configurations through the multiple-body motion. The $\Delta$V$_{\rm LOS}$ distributions for MCs with double and triple $^{13}$CO structures are similar, as well as their $\Delta$V$_{\rm LOS}$/$\sigma_{\rm ^{13}CO,in}$ distributions. This suggests that relative motions of $^{13}$CO structures within MCs are random and independent of cloud complexities and scales.

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss the possibility to observe neutrinos emitted from a failed core collapse Supernova in the various experiments at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. We show that the veto regions of dark matter and neutrinoless double beta decay experiments can be used as a network of small detectors to measure Supernova neutrinos. In addition we show that this network can measure very precisely the moment of black hole formation, which can be then used in the nearby VIRGO detector and future Einstein Telescope to look for the gravitational wave counterpart to the neutrino signal.

 - **Abstract**
 We present point-source photometry from the Spitzer Space Telescope's final survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We mapped 30 square degrees in two epochs in 2017, with the second extending to early 2018 at 3.6 and 4.5 microns using the Infrared Array Camera. This survey duplicates the footprint from the SAGE-SMC program in 2008. Together, these surveys cover a nearly 10 yr temporal baseline in the SMC. We performed aperture photometry on the mosaicked maps produced from the new data. We did not use any prior catalogs as inputs for the extractor in order to be sensitive to any moving objects (e.g., foreground brown dwarfs) and other transient phenomena (e.g., cataclysmic variables or FU Ori-type eruptions). We produced a point-source catalog with high-confidence sources for each epoch as well as combined-epoch catalog. For each epoch and the combined-epoch data, we also produced a more complete archive with lower-confidence sources. All of these data products will be available to the community at the Infrared Science Archive.

 - **Abstract**
 Among multi-messenger observations of the next galactic core-collapse supernova, Super-Kamiokande (SK) plays a critical role in detecting the emitted supernova neutrinos, determining the direction to the supernova (SN), and notifying the astronomical community of these observations in advance of the optical signal. On 2022, SK has increased the gadolinium dissolved in its water target (SK-Gd) and has achieved a Gd concentration of 0.033%, resulting in enhanced neutron detection capability, which in turn enables more accurate determination of the supernova direction. Accordingly, SK-Gd's real-time supernova monitoring system (Abe te al. 2016b) has been upgraded. SK_SN Notice, a warning system that works together with this monitoring system, was released on December 13, 2021, and is available through GCN Notices (Barthelmy et al. 2000). When the monitoring system detects an SN-like burst of events, SK_SN Notice will automatically distribute an alarm with the reconstructed direction to the supernova candidate within a few minutes. In this paper, we present a systematic study of SK-Gd's response to a simulated galactic SN. Assuming a supernova situated at 10 kpc, neutrino fluxes from six supernova models are used to characterize SK-Gd's pointing accuracy using the same tools as the online monitoring system. The pointing accuracy is found to vary from 3-7$^\circ$ depending on the models. However, if the supernova is closer than 10 kpc, SK_SN Notice can issue an alarm with three-degree accuracy, which will benefit follow-up observations by optical telescopes with large fields of view.

 - **Abstract**
 Computing the tidal deformations of Mars, we explored various Mars internal structures by examining profiles that include or exclude a basal molten layer within the mantle and a solid inner core. By assessing their compatibility with a diverse set of geophysical observations we show that despite the very short periods of excitation, tidal deformation is very efficient to constraint the Mars interior. We calculated densities and thicknesses for Martian lithosphere, mantle, {core-mantle boundary} layer and core and {found them} coherent with preexisting results from other methods. We also estimated new viscosities for these layers. We demonstrated that the geodetic record associated with thermal constraint is very sensitive to the {presence} of a basal molten layer in deep Martian mantle, and less sensitive to the solid core. Our results also indicate that the existence of the basal molten layer necessarily comes together with an inversion of viscosity between the lithosphere and the mantle. In this case, we could attribute this reverse viscosity contrast to the poor hydration state of Martian mantle and we underlined that this result prevents a strict Earth-like plate tectonics on Mars. The existence of the basal molten layer is also associated with a non-inversion of viscosity between the core-mantle boundary layer and the liquid core. Finally, in our results, a basal molten layer is incompatible with the existence of a solid inner core. Efforts to detect basal molten layer are then of prime importance to decipher the Martian interior. {Inversely, viscosity profiles appear to be very good tools for probing the existence of such molten layer at the base of the Mars mantle.

 - **Abstract**
 The computational fluid dynamics on a sphere is relevant to global simulations of geophysical fluid dynamics. Using the conventional spherical-polar (or lat-lon) grid results in a singularity at the poles, with orders of magnitude smaller cell sizes at the poles in comparison to the equator. To address this problem, we developed a general circulation model (dynamic core) with a gnomonic equiangular cubed-sphere configuration. This model is developed based on the Simulating Nonhydrostatic Atmospheres on Planets (SNAP) model, using a finite volume numerical scheme with a Riemann-solver-based dynamic core and the vertical implicit correction (VIC) scheme. This change of the horizontal configuration gives a 20-time acceleration of global simulations compared to the lat-lon grid with a similar number of cells at medium resolution. We presented standard tests ranging from 2D shallow-water models to 3D general circulation tests, including earth-like planets and shallow hot Jupiters, to validate the accuracy of the model. The method described in this article is generic to transform any existing finite-volume hydrodynamic model in the Cartesian geometry to the spherical geometry.
