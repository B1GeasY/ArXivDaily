 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the 3D structure of the Milky Way is a crucial step in deriving properties of the star-forming regions, as well as the Galaxy as a whole. We present a novel 3D map of the Milky Way plane that extends to 10 kpc distance from the Sun. We leverage the wealth of information in the near-IR APOGEE dataset and combine that with our state-of-the-art 3D mapping technique using Bayesian statistics and the Gaussian process to provide a large-scale 3D map of the dust in the Milky Way. Our map stretches across 10 kpc along both the X and Y axes, and 750 pc in the Z direction, perpendicular to the Galactic plane. Our results reveal multi-scale over-densities as well as large cavities in the Galactic plane and shed new light on the Galactic structure and spiral arms. We also provide a catalogue of large molecular clouds identified by our map with accurate distance and volume density estimates. Utilising volume densities derived from this map, we explore mass distribution across various Galactocentric radii. A general decline towards the outer Galaxy is observed, followed by local peaks, some aligning with established features like the Molecular Ring and segments of the spiral arms. Moreover, this work explores extragalactic observational effects on derived properties of molecular clouds by demonstrating the potential biases arising from column density measurements in inferring properties of these regions, and opens exciting avenues for further exploration and analysis, offering a deeper perspective on the complex processes that shape our galaxy and beyond.

          Feedback in emerging extragalactic star clusters, FEAST: The relation between 3.3 $\mu$m PAH emission and Star Formation Rate traced by ionized gas in NGC 628

 - **Abstract**
 We present maps of ionized gas (traced by Pa$\alpha$ and Br$\alpha$) and 3.3 $\mu$m Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 628, derived from new JWST/NIRCam data from the FEAST survey. With this data, we investigate and calibrate the relation between 3.3 $\mu$m PAH emission and star formation rate (SFR) in and around emerging young star clusters (eYSCs) on a scale of ${\sim}40$ pc. We find a tight (correlation coefficient $\rho$${\sim}$0.9) sub-linear (power-law exponent $\alpha$${\sim}$0.75) relation between the 3.3 $\mu$m PAH luminosity surface density and SFR traced by Br$\alpha$ for compact, cospatial (within 0.16$''$ or ${\sim}$7 pc) peaks in Pa$\alpha$, Br$\alpha$, and 3.3 $\mu$m (eYSC-I). The scatter in the relationship does not correlate well with variations in local interstellar medium (ISM) metallicity due to a radial metallicity gradient, but rather is likely due to stochastic sampling of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and variations in the PAH heating and age of our sources. The deviation from a linear relation may be explained by PAH destruction in more intense ionizing environments, variations in age, and IMF stochasticity at intermediate to low luminosities. We test our results with various continuum subtraction techniques using combinations of NIRCam bands and find that they remain robust with only minor differences in the derived slope and intercept. An unexpected discrepancy is identified between the relations of hydrogen recombination lines (Pa$\alpha$ versus Br$\alpha$; H$\alpha$ versus Br$\alpha$).

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) hold great potential for an unobscured view of protoneutron stars (PNSs) formed as a result of stellar collapses. While waiting for discovery, deepening the understanding of GW emission in theory is beneficial for both optimizing searching strategies and deciphering the eventual data. One significant aspect is the spatially dependent contribution to the overall GW signal extracted from sophisticated hydrodynamic simulations. I present the proper way to perform the spatial decomposition of GW strain with the quadrupole formula in the slow-motion and weak-field approximation. Then I demonstrate the approach using the results of a 2D axisymmetric pseudo-Newtonian hydrodynamic simulation of core-collapse supernova. I discuss the possible misleading interpretation based on the incorrect method in the literature that favors the dominant contribution by the PNS convective layer. Moreover, with the correct approach, the GW spatial profiles agree well with those calculated from a consistent perturbative method. This work re-emphasizes the global emission picture of GWs from PNS and motivates future prudent analyses with 3D simulations.

          How planets form by pebble accretion V. Silicate rainout delays contraction of sub-Neptunes

 - **Abstract**
 The characterization of Super-Earth-to-Neptune sized exoplanets relies heavily on our understanding of their formation and evolution. In this study, we link a model of planet formation by pebble accretion to the planets' long-term observational properties by calculating the interior evolution, starting from the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk. We investigate the evolution of the interior structure in 5-20 Earth masses planets, accounting for silicate redistribution caused by convective mixing, rainout (condensation and settling), and mass loss. Specifically, we have followed the fate of the hot silicate vapor that remained in the planet's envelope after planet formation, as the planet cools. We find that disk dissipation is followed by a rapid contraction of the envelope within 10 Myr. Subsequent cooling leads to substantial growth of the planetary core through silicate rainout, accompanied by inflated radii, in comparison to the standard models of planets that formed with core-envelope structure. We examine the dependence of rainout on the planet's envelope mass, distance from its host star, its silicate mass, and the atmospheric opacity. We find that the population of planets formed with polluted envelopes can be roughly divided in three groups, based on the mass of their gas envelopes: bare rocky cores that have shed their envelopes, super-Earth planets with a core-envelope structure, and Neptune-like planets with diluted cores that undergo gradual rainout. For polluted planets formed with envelope masses below 0.4 Earth mass, we anticipate that the inflation of the planet's radius caused by rainout will enhance mass loss by a factor of 2-8 compared to planets with non-polluted envelopes. Our model provides an explanation for bridging the gap between the predicted composition gradients in massive planets and the core-envelope structure in smaller planets.

          CCD $UBV(RI)_{KC}$ photometry and dynamics of the open cluster NGC 1513

 - **Abstract**
 We derive astrophysical parameters of the open cluster NGC 1513 by means of colour indices built with new $CCD\,UBV(RI)_{KC}$ photometry. Based on early-type members, the mean foreground reddening and total to selective extinction ratio are E(B-V)=0.79$\pm$0.09 mag and $R_{V}$=2.85$\pm$0.05. Through the differential grid method, we derive the metal abundance [Fe/H]=-0.06 dex (Z=+0.013), which is consistent with the value [Fe/H]=-0.088 of the bright giant member-LAMOST-695710060. The Z=+0.013 isochrone fit to the V x (B-V) colour-magnitude diagram leads to a turn-off age of 224$\pm$27 Myr (thus an intermediate-age cluster), and a distance modulus of ($V_{0}$ - $M_{\rm V}$)=10.90$\pm$0.15 mag, thus implying a distance from the Sun d=1514$\pm$105 pc. Within the uncertainties, our photometric distance is consistent with the value d=1435$\pm$14 pc from the Gaia DR3 parallax. We find signs of small mass segregation through a minimum spanning tree analysis for the 190 most massive stars, together with the rather steep mass function ($\chi$=+2.39) slope. The high core to half-light radius ratio $R_{core}$/$R_{h}$=0.82, together with the compact half-light to tidal radius ratio $R_{h}$/$R_{t}$=0.22, suggest that it is probably related to cluster-formation effects, due to little dynamical evolution, instead of driving its dynamical evolution by internal relaxation. Indeed, NGC 1513 is located in the second quadrant ($\ell$=152.59$^{\circ}$ and Galactocentric distance $R_{GC}$=9.57 kpc), which tends to minimize tidal effects by external processes and tidal disruption. Therefore, internal mass segregation effects in NGC 1513 seem to be more efficient than cluster evaporation processes. We find that NGC 1513 migrated about 0.50 kpc from its birth place.

          Probing the role of self-gravity in clouds impacted by AGN-driven winds

 - **Abstract**
 The impact of winds and jet-inflated bubbles driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) are believed to significantly affect the host galaxy's interstellar medium (ISM) and regulate star formation. To explore this scenario, we perform a suite of hydrodynamic simulations to model the interaction between turbulent star-forming clouds and highly pressurised AGN-driven outflows, focusing on the effects of self-gravity. Our results demonstrate that the cloudlets fragmented by the wind can become gravitationally bound, significantly increasing their survival time. While external pressurisation leads to a global collapse of the clouds in cases of weaker winds ($10^{42}-10^{43}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$), higher-power winds ($10^{44}-10^{45}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$) disperse the gas and cause localised collapse of the cloudlets. We also demonstrate that a kinetic energy-dominated wind is more efficient in accelerating and dispersing the gas than a thermal wind with the same power. The interaction can give rise to multi-phase outflows with velocities ranging from a few 100 to several 1000~${\rm km\,s^{-1}}$. The mass outflow rates are tightly correlated with the wind power, which we explain by an ablation-based mass-loss model. Moreover, the velocity dispersion and the virial parameter of the cloud material can increase by up to one order of magnitude through the effect of the wind. Even though the wind can suppress or quench star formation for about 1 Myr during the initial interaction, a substantial number of gravitationally bound dense cloudlets manage to shield themselves from the wind's influence and subsequently undergo rapid gravitational collapse, leading to an enhanced star formation rate (SFR).

          First star formation in extremely early epochs

 - **Abstract**
 First stars play crucial roles in development of the universe, influencing events like cosmic reionization and the chemical enrichment. While first stars are conventionally thought to form at around $z \sim 20-30$ in the standard $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology, observational constraints on small-scale density fluctuations remain limited, possibly differing significantly from the scale-invariant fluctuations assumed in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Should this be the case, the formation of first stars could occur much earlier than typically predicted. In this study, we investigate the formation process of first stars in the extremely early epochs of $z \gtrsim 100$ in the post-recombination universe. At such early times, the effects of the warm cosmic microwave background (CMB) become significant. We calculate the collapse of primordial star-forming clouds using a one-zone thermo-chemical model that accounts for CMB influences on radiative heating, Compton cooling, and photodissociation reactions. We found that the impact of the CMB on the evolution is limited at $z \lesssim 100$, with the temperature evolution closely resembling the conventional model. However, within the range $100 \lesssim z \lesssim 400$, the formation of H$_2$ via the H$^-$ channel is impeded by H$^-$ photodetachment induced by the CMB, leading to higher temperatures compared to standard one. Consequently, first stars with masses exceeding $1000 ~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ can emerge at $z \gtrsim 100$. Furthermore, at $z \gtrsim 500$, the temperature evolution becomes nearly isothermal solely due to atomic cooling, as H$_2$ formation is entirely suppressed. In such cases, supermassive stars with masses around $\sim 10^5 ~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ are expected to form solely via atomic cooling. These findings emphasize the significant variation in the typical mass of the first stars depending on the epoch of formation.
