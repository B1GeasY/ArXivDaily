 - **Abstract**
 The ages of star clusters and co-moving stellar groups contain essential information about the Milky Way. Their special properties make them excellent tracers of galactic structure and key components to unlocking its star formation history. Yet, even though the importance of stellar population ages has been widely recognized, their determination remains a challenging task often associated with highly model-dependent and uncertain results. We propose a new approach to this problem, which relies on empirical isochrones of known clusters extracted from high-quality observational data. These purely observation-based data products open up the possibility of relative age determination, free of stellar evolution model assumptions. For the derivation of the empirical isochrones, we used a combination of the statistical analysis tool principal component analysis for preprocessing and the supervised machine learning method support vector regression for curve extraction. To improve the statistical reliability of our result, we defined the empirical isochrone of a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of a cluster as the median calculated from a set of bootstrapped curves. We provide empirical isochrones in all Gaia DR2 and DR3 color combinations for 83 nearby clusters, paving the way for a relative comparison between individual stellar populations based on an age-scaling ladder of empirical isochrones of known clusters. Due to the precision of the available observational data, we report accurate lower main sequence empirical isochrones for many clusters in our sample, which are of special interest as this region is known to be especially complex to model. We validate our results by comparing the extracted empirical isochrones to cluster ages in the literature. We also investigate the added information that empirical isochrones covering the lower main sequence can provide on two case studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present synthetic line observations of a simulated molecular cloud, utilising a self-consistent treatment of the dynamics and time-dependent chemical evolution. We investigate line emission from the three most common CO isotopologues ($^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O) and six supposed tracers of dense gas (NH$_3$, HCN, N$_2$H$^+$, HCO$^+$, CS, HNC). Our simulation produces a range of line intensities consistent with that observed in real molecular clouds. The HCN-to-CO intensity ratio is relatively invariant with column density, making HCN (and chemically-similar species such as CS) a poor tracer of high-density material in the cloud. The ratio of N$_2$H$^+$ to HCN or CO, on the other hand, is highly selective of regions with densities above $10^{22} \, {\rm cm^{-2}}$, and the N$_2$H$^+$ line is a very good tracer of the dynamics of high volume density ($>10^4 \, {\rm cm^{-3}}$) material. Focusing on cores formed within the simulated cloud, we find good agreement with the line intensities of an observational sample of prestellar cores, including reproducing observed CS line intensities with an undepleted elemental abundance of sulphur. However, agreement between cores formed in the simulation, and models of isolated cores which have otherwise-comparable properties, is poor. The formation from and interaction with the large-scale environment has a significant impact on the line emission properties of the cores, making isolated models unsuitable for interpreting observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 Three-dimensional dust density maps are crucial for understanding the structure of the interstellar medium of the Milky Way and the processes that shape it. However, constructing these maps requires large datasets and the methods used to analyse them are computationally expensive and difficult to scale up. As a result it is has only recently become possible to map kiloparsec-scale regions of our Galaxy at parsec-scale grid sampling. We present all-sky three-dimensional dust density and extinction maps of the Milky Way out to 2.8~kpc in distance from the Sun using the fast and scalable Gaussian Process algorithm \DustT. The sampling of the three-dimensional map is $l,b,d = 1^{\circ} \times1^{\circ} \times 1.7$~pc. The input extinction and distance catalogue contains 120 million stars with photometry and astrometry from Gaia DR2, 2MASS and AllWISE. This combines the strengths of optical and infrared data to probe deeper into the dusty regions of the Milky Way. We compare our maps with other published 3D dust maps. All maps quantitatively agree at the $0.001$~mag~pc$^{-1}$ scale with many qualitatively similar features, although each map also has its own features. We recover Galactic features previously identified in the literature. Moreover, we also see a large under-density that may correspond to an inter-arm or -spur gap towards the Galactic Centre.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) model, which has been pivotal in cosmological studies, has faced significant challenges due to emerging observational and theoretical inconsistencies. This paper explores alternative cosmological models to address these discrepancies, using simulated three years photometric Supernovae Ia data from the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), supplemented with additional Pantheon+, Union, and the recently released Dark Energy Survey 5 Years (DESY5) supernova compilations and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements. We assess the constraining power of these datasets on various dynamic dark energy models, including CPL, BA, JBP, SCPL, and GCG. Our analysis demonstrates that the LSST with its high precision data, can provide tighter constraints on dark energy parameters compared to other datasets. Additionally, the inclusion of BAO measurements significantly improves parameter constraints across all models. Except for Pantheon+, we find that across all the cosmological datasets, and the dark energy models considered in this work, there is a consistent deviation from the LCDM model that exceeds a 2-sigma significance level. Our findings underscore the necessity of exploring dynamic dark energy models, which offer more consistent frameworks with fundamental physics and observational data, potentially resolving tensions within the LCDM paradigm. Furthermore, the use of simulated LSST data highlights the survey's potential in offering significant advantages for exploring alternative cosmologies, suggesting that future LSST observations would play a crucial role.
#### Simulations predict intermediate-mass black hole formation in globular clusters

 - **Abstract**
 Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are those between 100 and 10$^5$ solar masses ($M_{\odot}$); their formation process is debated. One possible origin is the growth of less massive black holes (BHs) via mergers with stars and compact objects within globular clusters (GCs). However, previous simulations have indicated that this process only produces IMBHs $<500 M_{\odot}$ because the gravitational wave recoil ejects them when they merge with other BHs. We perform star-by-star simulations of GC formation, finding that high-density star formation in a GC's parent giant molecular cloud can produce sufficient mergers of massive stars to overcome that mass threshold. We conclude that GCs can form with IMBHs $\gtrsim 10^3 M_{\odot}$, which is sufficiently massive to be retained within the GC even with the expected gravitational wave recoil.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The light element (anti-)correlations shown by globular clusters (GCs) are the main spectroscopic signature of multiple stellar populations. These internal abundance variations provide us with fundamental constraints on the formation mechanism of stellar clusters. Aims: Using Gaia-ESO, the largest and most homogeneous survey of open clusters (OCs), we intend to check whether these stellar aggregates display the same patterns. Based on previous studies of many GCs, several young and massive clusters in the Magellanic Clouds, as well as a few OCs, we do not expect to find any anti-correlation, given the low mass of Milky Way OCs. Methods: We used the results based on UVES spectra of stars in Gaia-ESO to derive the distribution of Na and O abundances and seevwhether they show an unexplained dispersion or whether they are anti-correlated. By selecting only high-probability members with high-precision stellar parameters, we ended up with more than 700 stars in 74 OCs. We examined the O-Na distribution in 28 OCsvwith at least 4 stars available as well as the Na distribution in 24 OCs, with at least 10 stars available. Results: We find that the distribution of Na abundances is compatible with a single-value population, within the errors. The fewvapparent exceptions can be explained by differences in the evolutionary phase (main sequence and giant post first dredge-up episode) or by difficulties in analysing low gravity giants. We did not find any indication of an Na-O anti-correlation in any of the clusters for which O has been derived. Conclusions: Based on the very small spread we find, OCs maintain the status of single stellar populations. However, a definitive answer requires studying more elements and larger samples covering different evolutionary phases. This will be possible with the next generation of large surveys

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged)Scalar field dark matter (SFDM) made of bosons has become a popular alternative to the CDM paradigm, especially for its potential to cure the so-called "small-scale problems" of CDM. Cosmological simulations have determined that SFDM halos exhibit a core-envelope structure, but they are computationally expensive. Halo cores have been found to be well approximated by "solitons". The study of single soliton and multiple soliton merger dynamics constitutes a more feasible approach to investigate in detail the genuine quantum dynamics of SFDM and its interplay with self-gravity for a multitude of free boson parameters. In this paper, we present dedicated simulations of single solitons and binary soliton mergers, for models without and with a 2-boson, repulsive, weak to intermediate self-interaction (SI), as well as multiple soliton mergers without SI. We adapt the open-source code Pyultralight to simulate solitons with SI. We derive numerical scaling relations between the central density and mass of solitons for several values of SI and find deviations from the monotonic relations known from fuzzy dark matter (no SI), or the strongly repulsive Thomas-Fermi regime. Solitons with SI exemplify larger cores and lower central densities, compared to solitons without SI. Using our simulations, we extract numerical density profiles for solitons and post-merger objects, and fit them to analytic functions of previous literature. We find a mild preference for Gaussian cores for objects with SI, while the envelopes of post-mergers can be fit to NFW profiles albeit with some caution as we discuss. Similar to previous work, we find global, persistent oscillations for solitons as well as post-mergers, confirming that self-gravitating SFDM has very long relaxation times, although objects with SI exhibit oscillations of comparatively smaller amplitude.
#### Support for fragile porous dust in a gravitationally self-regulated disk around IM Lup

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary disks, the birthplace of planets, are expected to be gravitationally unstable in their early phase of evolution. IM Lup, a well-known T-Tauri star, is surrounded by a protoplanetary disk with spiral arms likely caused by gravitational instability. The IM Lup disk has been observed using various methods, but developing a unified explanatory model is challenging. Here we present a physical model of the IM Lup disk that offers a comprehensive explanation for diverse observations spanning from near-infrared to millimeter wavelengths. Our findings underscore the importance of dust fragility in retaining the observed millimeter emission and reveal the preference for moderately porous dust to explain observed millimeter polarization. We also find that the inner disk region is likely heated by gas accretion, providing a natural explanation for bright millimeter emission within 20 au. The actively heated inner region in the model casts a 100-au-scale shadow, aligning seamlessly with the near-infrared scattered light observation. The presence of accretion heating also supports the fragile dust scenario in which accretion efficiently heat the disk midplane. Due to the fragility of dust, it is unlikely that a potential embedded planet at 100 au formed via pebble accretion in a smooth disk, pointing to local dust enhancement boosting pebble accretion or alternative pathways such as outward migration or gravitational fragmentation.
#### On the potential of probing the neutron star composition in accreting X-ray binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Transiently accreting Low Mass X-Ray Binaries have the potential to probe the core composition of their neutron stars via deep crustal heating caused by nuclear reactions. We statistically assess this deep crustal heating scenario, taking into account the various microphysical and astrophysical uncertainties. We find that despite the sizable uncertainties there is the chance to discriminate different compositional scenarios. Several observed sources statistically challenge a minimal hadronic matter composition, where cooling proceeds exclusively via slow modified Urca reactions. Considering here two exemplary extended uniform compositions, namely ultra-dense hadronic matter with direct Urca emission and ungapped quark matter, we find that they are even within uncertainties distinguishable. We show that although exotic forms of matter are generally only expected in an inner core, which could in principle have any size, sufficiently large astrophysical data sets nonetheless have the potential to statistically discriminate compositional scenarios, in particular when further mass measurements become available.
