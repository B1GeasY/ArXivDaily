 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalog of 315 protostellar outflow candidates detected in SiO J=5-4 in the ALMA-IMF Large Program, observed with ~2000 au spatial resolution, 0.339 km/s velocity resolution, and 2-12 mJy/beam (0.18-0.8 K) sensitivity. We find median outflow masses, momenta, and kinetic energies of ~0.3 M$_{\odot}$, 4 M$_{\odot}$ km/s, and 10$^{45}$ erg, respectively. Median outflow lifetimes are 6,000 years, yielding median mass, momentum, and energy rates of $\dot{M}$ = 10$^{-4.4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, $\dot{P}$ = 10$^{-3.2}$ M$_{\odot}$ km/s yr$^{-1}$, and $\dot{E}$ = 1 L$_{\odot}$. We analyze these outflow properties in the aggregate in each field. We find correlations between field-aggregated SiO outflow properties and total mass in cores (~3$-$5$\sigma$), and no correlations above 3$\sigma$ with clump mass, clump luminosity, or clump luminosity-to-mass ratio. We perform a linear regression analysis and find that the correlation between field-aggregated outflow mass and total clump mass - which has been previously described in the literature - may actually be mediated by the relationship between outflow mass and total mass in cores. We also find that the most massive SiO outflow in each field is typically responsible for only 15-30% of the total outflow mass (60% upper limit). Our data agree well with the established mechanical force-bolometric luminosity relationship in the literature, and our data extend this relationship up to L $\geq$ 10$^6$ L$_{\odot}$ and $\dot{P}$ $\geq$ 1 M$_{\odot}$ km/s yr$^{-1}$. Our lack of correlation with clump L/M is inconsistent with models of protocluster formation in which all protostars start forming at the same time.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore neutrino emission from nonrotating, single star models across six initial metallicities and seventy initial masses from the zero-age main sequence to the final fate. Overall, across the mass spectrum, we find metal-poor stellar models tend to have denser, hotter and more massive cores with lower envelope opacities, larger surface luminosities, and larger effective temperatures than their metal-rich counterparts. Across the mass-metallicity plane we identify the sequence (initial CNO $\rightarrow$ $^{14}$N $\rightarrow$ $^{22}$Ne $\rightarrow$ $^{25}$Mg $\rightarrow$ $^{26}$Al $\rightarrow$ $^{26}$Mg $\rightarrow$ $^{30}$P $\rightarrow$ $^{30}$Si) as making primary contributions to the neutrino luminosity at different phases of evolution. For the low-mass models we find neutrino emission from the nitrogen flash and thermal pulse phases of evolution depend strongly on the initial metallicity. For the high-mass models, neutrino emission at He-core ignition and He-shell burning depends strongly on the initial metallicity. Anti-neutrino emission during C, Ne, and O burning shows a strong metallicity dependence with $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$,$n$)$^{25}$Mg providing much of the neutron excess available for inverse-$\beta$ decays. We integrate the stellar tracks over an initial mass function and time to investigate the neutrino emission from a simple stellar population. We find average neutrino emission from simple stellar populations to be 0.5--1.2 MeV electron neutrinos. Lower metallicity stellar populations produce slightly larger neutrino luminosities and average $\beta$ decay energies. This study can provide targets for neutrino detectors from individual stars and stellar populations. We provide convenient fitting formulae and open access to the photon and neutrino tracks for more sophisticated population synthesis models.
#### A hot mini-Neptune and a temperate, highly eccentric sub-Saturn around  the bright K-dwarf TOI-2134

 - **Abstract**
 We present the characterisation of an inner mini-Neptune in a 9.2292005$\pm$0.0000063 day orbit and an outer mono-transiting sub-Saturn planet in a 95.50$^{+0.36}_{-0.25}$ day orbit around the moderately active, bright (mv=8.9 mag) K5V star TOI-2134. Based on our analysis of five sectors of TESS data, we determine the radii of TOI-2134b and c to be 2.69$\pm$0.16 R$_{e}$ for the inner planet and 7.27$\pm$0.42 R$_{e}$ for the outer one. We acquired 111 radial-velocity spectra with HARPS-N and 108 radial-velocity spectra with SOPHIE. After careful periodogram analysis, we derive masses for both planets via Gaussian Process regression: 9.13$^{+0.78}_{-0.76}$ M$_{e}$ for TOI-2134b and 41.86$^{+7.69}_{-7.83}$ M$_{e}$ for TOI-2134c. We analysed the photometric and radial-velocity data first separately, then jointly. The inner planet is a mini-Neptune with density consistent with either a water-world or a rocky core planet with a low-mass H/He envelope. The outer planet has a bulk density similar to Saturn's. The outer planet is derived to have a significant eccentricity of 0.67$^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$ from a combination of photometry and RVs. We compute the irradiation of TOI-2134c as 1.45$\pm$0.10 times the bolometric flux received by Earth, positioning it for part of its orbit in the habitable sone of its system. We recommend further RV observations to fully constrain the orbit of TOI-2134c. With an expected Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect amplitude of 7.2$\pm$1.3 m/s, we recommend TOI-2134c for follow-up RM analysis to study the spin-orbit architecture of the system. We calculate the Transmission Spectroscopy Metric, and both planets are suitable for bright-mode NIRCam atmospheric characterisation.
