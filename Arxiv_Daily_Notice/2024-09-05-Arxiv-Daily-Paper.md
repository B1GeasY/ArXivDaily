#### An efficient observational strategy for the detection of the Oort cloud

 - **Abstract**
 The Oort cloud is presumably a pristine relic of the Solar System formation. Detection of the Oort cloud may provide information regarding the stellar environment in which the Sun was born and on the planetesimal population during the outer planets' formation phase. The best suggested approach for detecting Oort cloud objects in situ, is by searching for sub-second occultations of distant stars by these objects. Following Brown & Webster, we discuss the possibility of detecting Oort cloud objects by observing near the quadrature direction. Due to the Earth's projected velocity, the occultations are longer near the quadrature direction and are therefore easier to detect, but have lower rate. We show that, for <1-m size telescopes, the increased exposure time will result in about one to three orders of magnitude increase in the number of detectable stars that have an angular size smaller than the Fresnel scale and are therefore suitable for an occultation search. We discuss the ability of this method to detect Oort cloud objects using existing survey telescopes, and we estimate the detection rate as a function of the power-law index of the size distribution of the Oort cloud objects and their distance from the Sun. We show that occultations detected using ~1-s integration by <1-m telescopes at the optimal region near the quadrature points will be marginally dominated by Oort cloud objects rather than Kuiper belt objects.

 - **Abstract**
 We present multi-wavelength data of SN2020acct, a double-peaked stripped-envelope supernova (SN) in NGC2981 at ~150 Mpc. The two peaks are temporally distinct, with maxima separated by 58 rest-frame days, and a factor of 20 reduction in flux between. The first is luminous (M$_{r}$ = -18.00 $\pm$ 0.02 mag), blue (g - r = 0.27 $\pm$ 0.03 mag), and displays spectroscopic signatures of interaction with hydrogen-free circumstellar material. The second peak is fainter (M$_{r}$ = -17.29 $\pm$ 0.03 mag), and spectroscopically similar to an evolved stripped-envelope SNe, with strong blended forbidden [Ca II] and [O II] features. No other known double-peak SN exhibits a light curve similar to that of SN 2020acct. We find the likelihood of two individual SNe occurring in the same star-forming region within that time to be highly improbable, while an implausibly fine-tuned configuration would be required to produce two SNe from a single binary system. We find that the peculiar properties of SN2020acct match models of pulsational pair instability (PPI), in which the initial peak is produced by collisions of shells of ejected material, shortly followed by a terminal explosion. Pulsations from a star with a 72 M$_{\odot}$ helium core provide an excellent match to the double-peaked light curve. The local galactic environment has a metallicity of 0.4 Z$_{\odot}$, a level where massive single stars are not expected retain enough mass to encounter the PPI. However, late binary mergers or a low-metallicity pocket may allow the required core mass. We measure the rate of SN 2020acct-like events to be $<3.3\times10^{-8}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ at z = 0.07, or <0.1% of the total core-collapse SN rate.
#### Radio signatures of cosmic-ray showers with deep in-ice antennas

 - **Abstract**
 To detect ultra-high-energy neutrinos, experiments such as ARA and RNO-G target the radio emission these particles induce when cascading in the ice, using deep antennas in South Pole or in Greenland. One of the main backgrounds for such signals is the radio emission generated by cosmic-ray showers, either directly in the ice, or in the air and transmitted to the ice, which can both reach the deep antennas. The first detection of cosmic rays with deep antennas would thus validate this detection principle and allow us to calibrate the detectors. FAERIE, the Framework for the simulation of Air shower Emission of Radio for in-Ice Experiments, is a numerical tool that couples both CoREAS and GEANT4 Monte-Carlo codes to simulate the radio emission from cosmic-ray showers deep in the ice. Using this code, we will investigate cosmic-ray radio signatures and the possible implications on the design of a cosmic-ray veto.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars in an open cluster are assumed to have formed from a broadly homogeneous distribution of gas, implying that they should be chemically homogeneous. Quantifying the level to which open clusters are chemically homogeneous can therefore tell us about ISM pollution and gas-mixing in progenitor molecular clouds. Using SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper and SDSS-IV APOGEE DR17 abundances, we test this assumption by quantifying intrinsic chemical scatter in up to 20 different chemical abundances across 26 Milky Way open clusters. We find that we can place 3${\sigma}$ upper limits on open cluster homogeneity within 0.02 dex or less in the majority of elements, while for neutron capture elements, as well as those elements having weak lines, we place limits on their homogeneity within 0.2 dex. Finally, we find that giant stars in open clusters are ~0.01 dex more homogeneous than a matched sample of field stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The increasing number of observations towards different environments in the Milky Way, as well as theoretical and experimental works, are improving our knowledge of the astrochemical processes in the interstellar medium (ISM). In this chapter we report some of the main projects to study the chemical complexity and isotopic ratios across the Galaxy. High-sensitivity spectral surveys covering broad bandwidths towards Galactic Center molecular clouds (e.g. G+0.693-0.027) and star-forming regions (e.g. the hot core G31.41+0.31) are revealing very rich astrochemical reservoirs, which include molecules of prebiotic interest. At the same time, isotopic ratios (e.g. $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C and $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N) can give important information on the Galactic chemical evolution, as well as on chemical local processes due to the physical conditions of the molecular clouds. We also highlight the role of cosmic rays as a key agent affecting the interstellar chemistry described above.
#### Scalable, Advanced Machine Learning-based Approaches for Stellar Flare Identification: Application to TESS short-cadence Data and Analysis of a New Flare Catalogue

 - **Abstract**
 We apply multi-algorithm machine learning models to TESS 2-minute survey data from Sectors 1-72 to identify stellar flares. Models trained with Deep Neural Network, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms, respectively, utilized four flare light curve characteristics as input features. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, all exceeding 94%. Validation against previously reported TESS M dwarf flare identifications showed that our models successfully recovered over 92% of the flares while detecting $\sim2,000$ more small events, thus extending the detection sensitivity of previous work. After processing 1.3 million light curves, our models identified nearly 18,000 flare stars and 250,000 flares. We present an extensive catalog documenting both flare and stellar properties. We find strong correlations in total flare energy and flare amplitude with color, in agreement with previous studies. Flare frequency distributions are analyzed, refining power-law slopes for flare behavior with the frequency uncertainties due to the detection incompleteness of low-amplitude events. We determine rotation periods for $\sim120,000$ stars thus yielding the relationship between rotation period and flare activity. We find that the transition in rotation period between the saturated and unsaturated regimes in flare energy coincides with the same transition in rotation period separating the saturated and unsaturated levels in coronal X-ray emission. We find that X-ray emission increases more rapidly with flare luminosity in earlier-type and unsaturated stars, indicating more efficient coronal heating in these objects. Additionally, we detect flares in white dwarfs and hot subdwarfs that are likely arising from unresolved low-mass companions.
#### The vela supernova remnant: The unique morphological features of jittering jets

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02626

 - **Abstract**
 We identify an S-shaped main-jet axis in the Vela core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant (CCSNR) that we attribute to a pair of precessing jets, one of the tens of pairs of jets that exploded the progenitor of Vela according to the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). A main-jet axis is a symmetry axis across the CCSNR and through the center. We identify the S-shaped main-jet axis by the high abundance of ejecta elements, oxygen, neon, and magnesium. We bring the number of identified pairs of clumps and ears in Vela to seven, two pairs shaped by the pair of precessing jets that formed the main-jet axis. The pairs and the main-jet axis form the point-symmetric wind-rose structure of Vela. The other five pairs of clumps/ears do not have signatures near the center, only on two opposite sides of the CCSNR. We discuss different possible jet-less shaping mechanisms to form such a point-symmetric morphology and dismiss these processes because they cannot explain the point-symmetric morphology of Vela, the S-shaped high ejecta abundance pattern, and the enormous energy to shape the S-shaped structure. Our findings strongly support the JJEM and further severely challenge the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent millimeter and submillimeter observations have unveiled elongated and asymmetric structures around protostars. These structures, referred to as streamers, often exhibit coherent velocity gradients, seemingly indicating a directed gas flow towards the protostars. However, their origin and role in star formation remain uncertain. A protostellar core Per-emb-2, located in Barnard 1, has a relatively large streamer with $10^4$ au, which is more prominent in emission from carbon chain molecules. We aim to unveil the formation mechanism of this streamer. We conducted mapping observations towards Per-emb-2 using the NRO 45-m telescope. We targeted carbon chain molecular lines such as CCS, HC$_3$N, and HC$_5$N. Using astrodendro, we identified one protostellar and four starless cores, including three new detections, on the Herschel map. The starless and protostellar cores are more or less gravitationally bound. We discovered strong CCS and HC$_3$N emissions extending from the north to the south, appearing to bridge the gap between the protostellar core and the starless core north of it. This bridge spans $3\times 10^4$ au with the velocities from 6.5 to 7.0 km s$^{-1}$. The bridge has the velocity gradient opposite to the streamer. Thus, the streamer is unlikely to be connected to this bridge, suggesting that the streamer does not have an accretion origin. We propose that a collision between a spherical core and the filament has shaped the density structure in this region, consequently triggering star formation within the head-tail-shaped core. In this core-filament collision (CFC) scenario, the collision appears to have fragmented the filament into two structures. The streamer is a bow structure, while the bridge is a remnant of the shock-compressed filament. Thus, we conclude that the Per-emb-2 streamer does not significantly contribute to the mass accumulation towards the protostar.

 - **Abstract**
 NGC 6334 is a giant molecular cloud complex with elongated filamentary structure, harbouring OB-stars, HII regions and star forming clumps. To study the emission and velocity structure of the gas in the extended NGC 6334 region, we made observations of the 12CO and 13CO (J=3-2) lines with the APEX telescope. The data provides a spatial resolution of 20 arcsec (~0.16 pc) and sensitivity of ~0.4 K at a spectral resolution of 0.25 km/s. Our observations reveal in the extended NGC 6334 region a connected velocity coherent structure of ~-3.9 km/s over ~80 pc parallel to the galactic plane. The NGC 6334 complex has two connected velocity structures at velocities ~ -9.2 km/s (the bridge features) and ~-20 km/s (the Northern Filament, NGC 6334-NF). We observed local velocity fluctuations at smaller spatial scales along the filament tracing local density enhancement and infall. We investigated the 13CO emission and velocity structure around HII regions and found that most HII regions show signs of molecular gas dispersal from the center and intensity enhancement at their outer radii. Overall NGC 6334 exhibits sequential star formation from west to east. Located in the west, the GM-24 region exhibits bubbles within bubbles and is at a relatively evolved stage of star formation. The NGC 6334 central ridge is undergoing global gas infall and exhibits two gas bridge features possibly connected to the cloud-cloud collision scenario of the NGC 6334-NF and the NGC 6334 main gas component. The relatively quiescent eastern filament (EF1 - G352.1) is a hub-filament in formation which shows the kinematic signature of global gas infall onto the filament. Our observations highlight the important role of H II regions in shaping the molecular gas emission and velocity structure as well as the overall evolution of the molecular filaments in NGC 6334.

 - **Abstract**
 The electromagnetic field is a fundamental force in nature that regulates the formation of stars in the universe. Despite decades of efforts, a reliable assessment of the importance of the magnetic fields in star formation relations remains missing. In star-formation research, our acknowledgment of the importance of magnetic field is best summarized by the Cruther+ 2010 B-rho relation. The relation is either interpreted as proof of the importance of a magnetic field in the collapse, or the result of self-similar collapse where the role of the magnetic is secondary to gravity. Using simulations, we find a fundamental relation, ${\cal M}_{\rm A}$-k$_{B-\rho}$(slope of $B-\rho$ relation) relation. This fundamental B-$\rho$-slope relation enables one to measure the Alfvénic Mach number, a direct indicator of the importance of the magnetic field, using the distribution of data in the B-$\rho$ plane. It allows us to drive the following empirical $B-\rho$ relation \begin{equation} \frac{B}{B_c} = {\rm exp}\left(\left(\frac{\gamma}{\cal K}\right)^{-1}\left( \frac{\rho}{\rho_c}\right)^\frac{\gamma}{\cal K}\right)\nonumber, \end{equation} which offers an excellent fit to the Cruther et al. data, where we assume ${\cal M}_{\rm A}-\rho$ relation. The foundational ${\cal M}_{\rm A}-{\rm k}_{B-\rho}$ relation provides an independent way to measure the importance of magnetic field against the kinematic motion using multiple magnetic field measurements. Our approach offers a new interpretation of Cruther+2010, where a gradual decrease in the importance of B at higher densities is implied.

 - **Abstract**
 The EXperiment for Cryogenic Large-Aperture Intensity Mapping (EXCLAIM) is a balloon-borne telescope designed to survey star formation over cosmological time scales using intensity mapping in the 420 - 540 GHz frequency range. EXCLAIM uses a fully cryogenic telescope coupled to six on-chip spectrometers featuring kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) to achieve high sensitivity, allowing for fast integration in dark atmospheric windows. The telescope receiver is cooled to $\approx$ 1.7 K by immersion in a superfluid helium bath and enclosed in a superfluid-tight shell with a meta-material anti-reflection coated silicon window. In addition to the optics and the spectrometer package, the receiver contains the magnetic shielding, the cryogenic segment of the spectrometer readout, and the sub-Kelvin cooling system. A three-stage continuous adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (CADR) keeps the detectors at 100 mK while a $^4$He sorption cooler provides a 900 mK thermal intercept for mechanical suspensions and coaxial cables. We present the design of the EXCLAIM receiver and report on the flight-like testing of major receiver components, including the superfluid-tight receiver window and the sub-Kelvin coolers.
#### Follow the Mass -- A Concordance Picture of Tidal Disruption Events

 - **Abstract**
 Three recent global simulations of tidal disruption events (TDEs) have produced, using different numerical techniques and parameters, very similar pictures of their dynamics. In typical TDEs, after the star is disrupted by a supermassive black hole, the bound portion of the stellar debris follows highly eccentric trajectories, reaching apocenters of several thousand gravitational radii. Only a very small fraction is captured upon returning to the vicinity of the supermassive black hole. Nearly all the debris returns to the apocenter, where shocks produce a thick irregular cloud on this radial scale and power the optical/UV flare. These simulation results imply that over a few years, the thick cloud settles into an accretion flow responsible for the long term emission. Despite not being designed to match observations, the dynamical picture given by the three simulations aligns well with observations of typical events, correctly predicting the flares' total radiated energy, luminosity, temperature and emission line width. On the basis of these predictions, we provide an updated method ({\sc TDEmass}) to infer the stellar and black hole masses from a flare's peak luminosity and temperature. This picture also correctly predicts the luminosity observed years after the flare. In addition, we show that in a magnitude-limited survey, if the intrinsic rate of TDEs is independent of black hole mass, the detected events will preferentially have black hole masses $\sim 10^{6 \pm 0.3} M_\odot$ and stellar masses of $\sim 1-1.5 M_\odot$.
