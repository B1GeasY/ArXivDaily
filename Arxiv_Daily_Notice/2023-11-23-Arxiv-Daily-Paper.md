 - **Abstract**
 The variations of elemental abundance and their ratios along the Galactocentric radius result from the chemical evolution of the Milky Way disks. The $\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$ ratio in particular is often used as a proxy to determine other isotopic ratios, such as $\rm ^{16}O/^{18}O$ and $\rm ^{14}N/^{15}N$. Measurements of $\rm ^{12}CN$ and $\rm ^{13}CN$ (or $\rm C^{15}N$) -- with their optical depths corrected via their hyper-fine structure lines -- have traditionally been exploited to constrain the Galactocentric gradients of the CNO isotopic ratios. Such methods typically make several simplifying assumptions (e.g. a filling factor of unity, the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation, and the neglect of the cosmic microwave background) while adopting a single average gas phase. However, these simplifications introduce significant biases to the measured $\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$ and $\rm ^{14}N/^{15}N$. We demonstrate that exploiting the optically thin satellite lines of $\rm ^{12}CN$ constitutes a more reliable new method to derive $\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$ and $\rm ^{14}N/^{15}N$ from CN isotopologues. We apply this satellite-line method to new IRAM 30-m observations of $\rm ^{12}CN$, $\rm ^{13}CN$, and $\rm C^{15}N$ $N=1\to0$ towards 15 metal-poor molecular clouds in the Galactic outer disk ($R_{\rm gc} > $ 12 kpc), supplemented by data from the literature. After updating their Galactocentric distances, we find that $\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$ and $\rm ^{14}N/^{15}N$ gradients are in good agreement with those derived using independent optically thin molecular tracers, even in regions with the lowest metallicities. We therefore recommend using optically thin tracers for Galactic and extragalactic CNO isotopic measurements, which avoids the biases associated with the traditional method.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron stars (NSs) and white dwarfs (WDs) are characterized by different geometric and physical properties, but their observed properties are often similar, making them difficult to distinguish. Therefore, it is desirable to search for their spectral features that could be easily identified from observations. We present spectral and timing signatures of NSs and WDs hosted in accreting X-ray binaries that can be easily identified from X-ray observations. We perform spectral and timing analysis of 4U~1636--53 and SS~Cygni, as typical representatives of such NS and WD binaries, based on their X-ray observations by RXTE, ASCA, Suzaku and BeppoSAX uising {\it Comptonization} spectral model. As a result, we formulate a criterion that makes it easy to distinguish NS from WD in such binaries: NS X-rays exhibits clear quasi-stable behavior with the index $\Gamma\to2$ and is characterized by quasi periodic oscillations (QPOs) at $\nu_{QPO} >0.5$~Hz, although WD X-rays is stable with $\Gamma \to1.85$ and is accompanied by QPOs at $\nu_{QPO}<0.05$~Hz during source outbursts. In addition, we revealed that in 4U~1636--53 the mHz QPOs anti-correlate with the plasma temperature, $T_e$ of Compton cloud (or the corona around a NS. This allowed us to associate mHz-QPOs with the corona dynamics during outburst cycle. The above index effect, now well established for 4U~1636--53 and SS~Cygni using extensive observations, has previously been found in other low-mass X-ray NS and WD binaries and agrees well with the criterion for distinguishing NSs and WDs presented here.
#### Constraining Background N2 Inventories on Directly Imaged Terrestrial  Exoplanets to Rule Out O2 False Positives

 - **Abstract**
 Direct imaging spectroscopy with future space-based telescopes will constrain terrestrial planet atmospheric composition and potentially detect biosignature gases. One promising indication of life is abundant atmospheric O2. However, various non-biological processes could also lead to O2 accumulation in the atmospheres of potentially habitable planets around Sun-like stars. In particular, the absence of non-condensible background gases such as N2 could result in appreciable H escape and abiotic O2 buildup, so identifying background atmosphere composition is crucial for contextualizing any O2 detections. Here, we perform retrievals on simulated directly imaged terrestrial planets using rfast, a new exoplanet atmospheric retrieval suite with direct imaging analysis capabilities. By simulating Earth-analog retrievals for varied atmospheric compositions, cloud properties, and surface pressures, we determine what wavelength range, spectral resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) are necessary to constrain background gases' identity and abundance. We find N2 backgrounds can be uniquely identified with S/N$\sim$20 observations, provided that wavelength coverage extends beyond $\sim$1.6 $\mu$m to rule out CO-dominated atmospheres. Additionally, there is a low probability of O2-dominated atmospheres due to an O2-N2 degeneracy that is only totally ruled out at S/N$\sim$40. If wavelength coverage is limited to 0.2-1.1 $\mu$m, then although all other cosmochemically plausible backgrounds can be readily excluded, N2 and CO backgrounds cannot be distinguished. Overall, our simulated retrievals and associated integration time calculations suggest that near-infrared coverage to at least 1.6 $\mu$m and apertures approaching 8m are needed to confidently rule out O2 biosignature false positives within feasible integration times
#### Insights into star formation and dispersal from the synchronisation of  stellar clocks

 - **Abstract**
 Age is one of the most fundamental parameters of stars, yet it is one of the hardest to determine as it requires modelling various aspects of stellar formation and evolution. When we compare the ages derived from isochronal and dynamical traceback methods for six young stellar associations, we find a systematic discrepancy. Specifically, dynamical traceback ages are consistently younger by an average of $\langle\Delta_{\rm Age}\rangle = 5.5 \pm 1.1$ Myr. We rule out measurement errors as the cause of the age mismatch and propose that $\Delta_{\rm Age}$ indicates the time a young star remains bound to its parental cloud before moving away from its siblings. In this framework, the dynamical traceback "clock" starts when a stellar cluster or association begins to expand after expelling most of the gas, while the isochronal "clock" starts earlier when most stars form. The difference between these two age-dating techniques is a powerful tool to constraint evolutionary models, as isochronal ages cannot be younger than dynamical traceback ages. Measuring the $\Delta_{\rm Age}$ accurately and understanding its variations across different environments will provide further information on the impact of local conditions and stellar feedback on the formation and dispersal of stellar clusters.
#### Polarimetry of Didymos-Dimorphos: Unexpected Long-Term Effects of the  DART Impact

 - **Abstract**
 We have monitored the Didymos-Dimorphos binary system in imaging polarimetric mode before and after the impact from the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission. A previous spectropolarimetric study showed that the impact caused a dramatic drop in polarisation. Our longer-term monitoring shows that the polarisation of the post-impact system remains lower than the pre-impact system even months after the impact, suggesting that some fresh ejecta material remains in the system at the time of our observations, either in orbit or settled on the surface. The slope of the post-impact polarimetric curve is shallower than that of the pre-impact system, implying an increase in albedo of the system. This suggests that the ejected material is composed of smaller and possibly brighter particles than those present on the pre-impact surface of the asteroid. Our polarimetric maps show that the dust cloud ejected immediately after the impact polarises light in a spatially uniform manner (and at a lower level than pre-impact). Later maps exhibit a gradient in polarisation between the photocentre (which probes the asteroid surface) and the surrounding cloud and tail. The polarisation occasionally shows some small-scale variations, the source of which is not yet clear. The polarimetric phase curve of Didymos-Dimorphos resembles that of the S-type asteroid class.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: High-resolution spectrographs fed by adaptive optics (AO) provide a unique opportunity to characterize directly imaged exoplanets. Observations with such instruments allow us to probe the atmospheric composition, spin rotation, and radial velocity of the planet, thereby helping to reveal information on its formation and migration history. The recent upgrade of the Cryogenic High-Resolution Infrared Echelle Spectrograph (CRIRES+) at the VLT makes it a highly suitable instrument for characterizing directly imaged exoplanets. Aims: In this work, we report on observations of $\beta$ Pictoris b with CRIRES+ and use them to constrain the planets atmospheric properties and update the estimation of its spin rotation. Methods: The data were reduced using the open-source \textit{pycrires} package. We subsequently forward-modeled the stellar, planetary, and systematic contribution to the data to detect molecules in the planet's atmosphere. We also used atmospheric retrievals to provide new constraints on its atmosphere. Results: We confidently detected water and carbon monoxide in the atmosphere of $\beta$ Pictoris b and retrieved a slightly sub-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio, which is in agreement with previous results. The interpretation is hampered by our limited knowledge of the C/O ratio of the host star. We also obtained a much improved constraint on its spin rotation of $19.9 \pm 1.0$ km/s, which gives a rotation period of $8.7 \pm 0.8$ hours, assuming no obliquity. We find that there is a degeneracy between the metallicity and clouds, but this has minimal impact on the retrieved C/O, $v\sin{i}$, and radial velocity. Our results show that CRIRES+ is performing well and stands as a highly useful instrument for characterizing directly imaged planets.
