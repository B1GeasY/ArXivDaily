 - **Abstract**
 The mass-radius relationship of white dwarfs (WDs) is one of their defining characteristics, largely derived from electron degeneracy pressure. We present a model-independent study of the observed mass-radius relationship in WD binaries of \cite{Parsons_2017}, listing data over a broad temperature range up to about 60,000 K (5 eV). The data show an appreciable temperature sensitivity with pronounced intrinsic scatter (beyond measurement uncertainty) for the canonical He-models with proton-to-neutron ratio 1:1. We characterize temperature sensitivity by a temperature scale $T_0$ in model-agnostic power-law relations with temperature normalized radius. For low-mass WDs, the results identify a remarkably modest $T_0 = 1 \sim 2 $ eV. We comment on a potential interpretation for atmospheres insulating super-Eddington temperature cores from the sub-Eddington photospheres of low-mass WDs.

 - **Abstract**
 Circumbinary planets (CBPs) are planets that orbit around both stars of a binary system. This chapter traces the history of research on CBPs and provides an overview over the current knowledge about CBPs and their detection methods. After early speculations about CBPs, inspired by binary star systems and popularized by fictional works, their scientific exploration began with the identification of circumbinary dust disks and progressed to the detection and characterization of the current sample of CBPs. The major part of this review presents the detection methods for CBPs: eclipse timing variations from the light-travel-time effect and from dynamical interactions, transits, radial velocities, direct imaging, gravitational microlensing and astrometry. Each of these methods is described with its strengths and limitations and the main characeristics of the CBP systems found by them are outlined. The potential habitability of CBPs is considered, taking into account the unique environmental conditions created by orbiting a stellar binary. The importance of multi-method detection strategies is underscored, and future advancements from upcoming missions like PLATO are anticipated, promising to expand the understanding of these intriguing celestial bodies.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of dark matter on neutron star properties using the relativistic mean-field theory. By incorporating the dark matter model, we explore how dark matter parameters, specifically dark matter mass and Fermi momentum, influence nuclear saturation properties, the equation of state, and the mass-radius relationship of neutron stars. We also examine the universal relation between dimensionless tidal deformability and compactness in the presence of dark matter. Our results show that the inclusion of dark matter significantly alters nuclear saturation properties, leading to higher incompressibility and symmetry energy values. Notably, higher dark matter Fermi momenta and masses result in more compact neutron star configurations with reduced radii and lower maximum masses, highlighting a complex interplay between dark matter and nuclear matter. Deviations from the universal relation are observed with dark matter inclusion, particularly for neutron stars with lower compactness. By leveraging observational data from PSR J0740+6620, GW170817, and Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) measurements of PSR J0030+0451, we derive stringent constraints on dark matter parameter space within neutron stars, emphasizing the necessity of integrating multimodal observations to delineate the properties of dark matter along with neutron stars. Our findings underscore the importance of considering dark matter effects in neutron star modeling and suggest potential refinements for current theoretical frameworks to accurately predict neutron star properties under various astrophysical conditions.
#### Arkenstone -- II. A model for unresolved cool clouds entrained in galactic winds in cosmological simulations

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15321

 - **Abstract**
 Arkenstone is a new scheme that allows multiphase, stellar feedback-driven winds to be included in coarse resolution cosmological simulations. The evolution of galactic winds and their subsequent impact on the circumgalactic medium are altered by exchanges of mass, energy, momentum, and metals between their component phases. These exchanges are governed by complex, small-scale physical processes that cannot be resolved in cosmological simulations. In this second presentation paper, we describe Arkenstone's novel cloud particle approach for modelling unresolvable cool clouds entrained in hot, fast winds. This general framework allows models of the cloud-wind interaction, derived from state-of-the-art high-resolution simulations, to be applied in a large-scale context. In this work, we adopt a cloud evolution model that captures simultaneous cloud mass loss to and gain from the ambient hot phase via turbulent mixing and radiative cooling, respectively. We demonstrate the scheme using non-cosmological idealized simulations of a galaxy with a realistic circumgalactic medium component, using the Arepo code. We show that the ability of a high-specific energy wind component to perform preventative feedback may be limited by heavy loading of cool clouds coupled into it. We demonstrate that the diverging evolution of clouds of initially differing masses leads to a complex velocity field for the cool phase and a cloud mass function that varies both spatially and temporally in a non-trivial manner. These latter two phenomena can manifest in the simulation because of our choice of a Lagrangian discretisation of the cloud population, in contrast to other proposed schemes.

#### Are Stars Really Ingesting their Planets? Examining an Alternative Explanation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15326

 - **Abstract**
 Numerous stars exhibit surprisingly large variations in their refractory element abundances, often interpreted as signatures of planetary ingestion events. In this study, we propose that differences in the dust-to-gas ratio near stars during their formation can produce similar observational signals. We investigate this hypothesis using a suite of radiation-dust-magnetohydrodynamic STARFORGE simulations of star formation. Our results show that the distribution of refractory abundance variations ($\rm \Delta [X/H]$) has extended tails, with about 10-30% of all stars displaying variations around $\sim$0.1 dex. These variations are comparable to the accretion of $2-5 \rm M_\oplus$ of planetary material into the convective zones of Sun-like stars. The width of the distributions increases with the incorporation of more detailed dust physics, such as radiation pressure and back-reaction forces, as well as with larger dust grain sizes and finer resolutions. Furthermore, our simulations reveal no correlation between $\rm \Delta [X/H]$ and stellar separations, suggesting that dust-to-gas fluctuations likely occur on scales smaller than those of wide binaries. These findings highlight the importance of considering dust dynamics as a potential source of the observed chemical enrichment in stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Starburst wind models predict that metals and energy are primarily carried out of the disk by hot gas ($T > 10^{6}$ K), but the low energy resolution of X-ray CCD observations results in large uncertainties on the mass and energy loading. Here, we present evidence for a fast soft X-ray wind from the prototypical starburst galaxy M82 using deep archival observations from the Reflection Grating Spectrometer on XMM-Newton. After characterizing the complex line-spread function for the spatially extended outflow ($\approx 4'$), we perform emission-line fitting to measure the velocity dispersion, $\sigma_{\text{v}}$, from OVIII (0.65, 0.77 keV), NeX (1.02 keV), and MgXII (1.47 keV). For the $T \approx 3 \times 10^{6}$ K gas, OVIII yields a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_{\text{v}} = 1160^{+100}_{-90}$ km s$^{-1}$, implying a wind speed that is significantly above the escape velocity ($v_{\text{esc}} \lesssim 450$ km s$^{-1}$). NeX ($\sigma_{\text{v}} = 550^{+130}_{-150}$ km s$^{-1}$) and MgXII ($\sigma_{\text{v}} < 370$ km s$^{-1}$) show less velocity broadening than OVIII, hinting at a lower wind speed or smaller opening angle on the more compact spatial scales traced by the $T \approx (0.6 - 1) \times 10^{7}$ K gas. Alternatively, these higher energy emission lines may be dominated by shock-heated gas in the interstellar medium. Future synthesis of these measurements with Performance Verification observations of the $E = 2 - 12$ keV wind in M82 from the Resolve microcalorimeter on the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission will inform the phase structure and energy budget of the hot starburst wind.
#### Can metal-rich worlds form by giant impacts?

 - **Abstract**
 Planets and stars are expected to be compositionally linked because they accrete from the same material reservoir. However, astronomical observations revealed the existence of exoplanets whose bulk density is far higher than what is expected from host-stars' composition. A commonly-invoked theory is that these high-density exoplanets are the metallic cores of super-Earth-sized planets whose rocky mantles were stripped by giant impacts. Here, by combining orbital dynamics and impact physics, we show that mantle-stripping giant impacts between super-Earths are unlikely to occur at rates sufficient to explain the observed size and currently estimated abundance of the high-density exoplanets. We explain this as the interplay of two main factors: the parent super-Earths being in most cases smaller than 2 Earth radii; and the efficiency of mantle stripping decreasing with increasing planetary size. We conclude that most of the observed high-density exoplanets are unlikely to be metal-rich giant-impact remnants.
#### Revealing Potential Initial Mass Function variations with metallicity: JWST observations of young open clusters in a low-metallicity environment

 - **Abstract**
 We present the substellar mass function of star-forming clusters ($\simeq$0.1 Myr old) in a low-metallicity environment ($\simeq$$-$0.7 dex). We performed deep JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging of two star-forming clusters in Digel Cloud 2, a star-forming region in the Outer Galaxy ($R_G \gtrsim 15$ kpc). The very high sensitivity and spatial resolution of JWST enable us to resolve cluster members clearly down to a mass detection limit of 0.02 $M_\odot$, enabling the first detection of brown dwarfs in low-metallicity clusters. Fifty-two and ninety-one sources were extracted in mass-$A_V$-limited samples in the two clusters, from which Initial mass functions (IMFs) were derived by model-fitting the F200W band luminosity function, resulting in IMF peak masses (hereafter $M_C$) $\log M_C / M_\odot \simeq -1.5 \pm 0.5$ for both clusters. Although the uncertainties are rather large, the obtained $M_C$ values are lower than those in any previous study ($\log M_C / M_\odot \sim -0.5$). Comparison with the local open clusters with similar ages to the target clusters ($\sim$$10^6$-$10^7$ yr) suggests a metallicity dependence of $M_C$, with lower $M_C$ at lower metallicities, while the comparison with globular clusters, similarly low metallicities but considerably older ($\sim$$10^{10}$ yr), suggests that the target clusters have not yet experienced significant dynamical evolution and remain in their initial physical condition. The lower $M_C$ is also consistent with the theoretical expectation of the lower Jeans mass due to the higher gas density under such low metallicity. The $M_C$ values derived from observations in such an environment would place significant constraints on the understanding of star formation.
#### Ice Chemistry Modeling of Active Phase Comets: Hale-Bopp

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15509

 - **Abstract**
 We present a chemical kinetics model of the solid-phase chemical evolution of a comet, beginning with a long period of cold-storage in the Oort Cloud, followed by five orbits that bring the comet close to the Sun. The chemical model is based on an earlier treatment that considered only the cold-storage phase, and which was based on the interstellar ice chemical kinetics model MAGICKAL. The comet is treated as 25 chemically distinct layers. Updates to the previous model includes: (i) Time- and depth-dependent temperature profiles according to heliocentric distance; (ii) a rigorous treatment of back-diffusion for species capable of diffusing through the bulk-ice layers; (iii) adoption of recent improvements in the kinetic treatment of nondiffusive chemical reaction rates. Starting from an initially simple ice composition, interstellar UV photons drive a rapid chemistry in the upper micron of material, but diminished by absorption of the UV by the dust component. Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) drive a much slower chemistry in the deeper ices over the long cold-storage period down to 10 m. The first solar approach drives off the upper layers of ice material via thermal desorption and/or dissociation, bringing closer to the surface the deeper material that previously underwent long-term processing by GCRs. Subsequent orbits are more uniform in their chemical behavior. Loss of molecular material leads to concentration of the dust in the upper layers. Substantial quantities of complex organic molecules are formed in the upper 10 m during the cold storage phase, with some of this material released during solar approach; however, their abundances with respect to water appear too low to account for the observed gas-phase values for comet Hale-Bopp, indicating that the majority of complex molecular material observed, at least in comet Hale-Bopp, is an inheritance of primordial material.
#### FAUST XIX. D$_2$CO in the outflow cavities of NGC\,1333 IRAS\,4A: recovering the physical structure of its original prestellar core

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular deuteration is a powerful diagnostic tool for probing the physical conditions and chemical processes in astrophysical environments. In this work, we focus on formaldehyde deuteration in the protobinary system NGC\,1333 IRAS\,4A, located in the Perseus molecular cloud. Using high-resolution ($\sim$\,100\,au) ALMA observations, we investigate the [D$_2$CO]/[HDCO] ratio along the cavity walls of the outflows emanating from IRAS\,4A1. Our analysis reveals a consistent decrease in the deuteration ratio (from $\sim$\,60-20\% to $\sim$\,10\%) with increasing distance from the protostar (from $\sim$\,2000\,au to $\sim$\,4000\,au). Given the large measured [D$_2$CO]/[HDCO], both HDCO and D$_2$CO are likely injected by the shocks along the cavity walls into the gas-phase from the dust mantles, formed in the previous prestellar phase. We propose that the observed [D$_2$CO]/[HDCO] decrease is due to the density profile of the prestellar core from which NGC\,1333 IRAS\,4A was born. When considering the chemical processes at the base of formaldehyde deuteration, the IRAS\,4A's prestellar precursor had a predominantly flat density profile within 3000\,au and a decrease of density beyond this radius.

 - **Abstract**
 We report a result of plasma diagnostics of the supernova remnant (SNR) 3C 400.2, which has been reported to have a recombining plasma (RP) by previous studies. For careful background estimation, we simultaneously fitted spectra extracted from the SNR and background regions and evaluated the SNR emission contaminating the background-region spectrum as well as the background emission in the source-region spectrum. The SNR emission is explained by the collisional ionization equilibrium plasma originating from the interstellar medium and the ionizing plasma originating from the ejecta, in contrast to the previous studies. In addition, we found an unidentified X-ray source near the SNR, Suzaku J1937.4+1718, which is accompanied by an emission line at ~4.4~keV with the 2.8$\sigma$ confidence level. Since there is no striking atomic line at the energy in the rest frame, Suzaku J1937.4+1718 can be an extragalactic object with a redshifted Fe line.
#### Casting Light on Degeneracies: A Comprehensive Study of Lightcurve Variations in Microlensing Events OGLE-2017-BLG-0103 and OGLE-2017-BLG-0192

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates orbital parallax in gravitational microlensing events, focusing on OGLE-2017-BLG-0103 and OGLE-2017-BLG-0192. For events with timescales $\leq$ 60 days, a Jerk Parallax degeneracy arises due to high Jerk velocity ($\tilde{v_{j}}$), causing a four-fold continuous parallax degeneracy. OGLE-2017-BLG-0103, after incorporating orbital parallax, reveals four discrete degenerate parallax solutions, while OGLE-2017-BLG-0192 exhibits four discrete solutions without degeneracy. {The asymmetric light curve of OGLE-2017-BLG-0103 suggests a more probable model where xallarap is added to the parallax model, introducing tension. The galactic model analysis predicts a very low mass stellar lens for OGLE-2017-BLG-0192. For OGLE-2017-BLG-0103, degenerate solutions suggest a low-mass star or a darker lens in the disc, while the Xallarap+Parallax model also predicts a stellar lens in the bulge, with the source being a solar-type star orbited by a dwarf star.} This study presents five degenerate solutions for OGLE-2017-BLG-0103, emphasizing the potential for confirmation through high-resolution Adaptive Optics (AO) observations with Extremely Large Telescopes in the future. The complexities of degenerate scenarios in these microlensing events underscore the need to analyze special single-lens events in the Roman Telescope Era.
#### Particle acceleration, escape and non-thermal emission from core-collapse supernovae inside non-identical wind-blown bubbles

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15839

 - **Abstract**
 In the core-collapse scenario, the supernova remnants evolve inside the complex wind-blown bubbles, structured by massive progenitors during their lifetime. Therefore, particle acceleration and the emissions from these SNRs can carry the fingerprints of the evolutionary sequences of the progenitor stars. We time-dependently investigate the impact of the ambient environment of core-collapse SNRs on particle spectra and the emissions. We use the RATPaC code to model the particle acceleration at the SNRs with progenitors having ZAMS masses of 20 Msol and 60 Msol. We have constructed the pre-supernova circumstellar medium by solving the hydrodynamic equations for the lifetime of the progenitor stars. Then, the transport equation for cosmic rays, and magnetic turbulence in test-particle approximation along with the induction equation for the evolution of large-scale magnetic field have been solved simultaneously with the hydrodynamic equations for the expansion of SNRs inside the pre-supernova CSM. The structure of the wind bubbles along with the magnetic field and the scattering turbulence regulate the spectra of accelerated particles for both SNRs. For the 60 Msol progenitor the spectral index reaches 2.4 even below 10 GeV during the propagation of the SNR shock inside the hot shocked wind. In contrast, we have not observed persistent soft spectra at earlier evolutionary stages of the SNR with 20 Msol progenitor, for which the spectral index becomes 2.2 only for a brief period. Later, the spectra become soft above ~10 GeV for both SNRs, as weak driving of turbulence permits the escape of high-energy particles from the remnants. The emission morphology of the SNRs strongly depends on the type of progenitors. For instance, the radio morphology of the SNR with 20 Msol progenitor is centre-filled at early stages whereas that for the more massive progenitor is shell-like.
#### The ESO UVES/FEROS Large Programs of TESS OB pulsators. II. On the physical origin of macroturbulence

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15888

 - **Abstract**
 Spectral lines of hot massive stars are known to exhibit large excess broadening in addition to rotational broadening. This excess broadening is often attributed to macroturbulence whose physical origin is a matter of active debate in the stellar astrophysics community. By looking into the statistical properties of a large sample of O- and B-type stars, both in the Galaxy and LMC, we aim to shed light on the physical origin of macroturbulent line broadening. We deliver newly measured macroturbulent velocities for 86 stars from the Galaxy in a consistent manner with 126 stars from the LMC. A total sample of 594 O- and B-type stars with measured macroturbulent velocities was composed by complementing our sample with archival data. Furthermore, we compute an extensive grid of MESA models to compare, in a statistical manner, the predicted interior properties of stars (such as convection and wave propagation) with the inference of macroturbulent velocities from high-resolution spectroscopic observations. We find the presence of two principally different regimes where, depending on the initial stellar mass, different mechanisms may be responsible for the observed excess line broadening. Stars with initial masses above some 30$M_{\odot}$ are found to have macroturbulent velocities fully determined by subsurface convective zones formed in the iron opacity bump (FeCZ), while some other mechanism is required to explain observations for masses below 12$M_{\odot}$. The latter finding leaves the potential for waves generated at the interface of the convective core and radiative envelope of the star to be responsible for the observed macroturbulent broadening. Both mechanisms may co-exist in the intermediate regime of stellar masses, between some 12 and 30$M_{\odot}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar filaments can undergo eruptions and result in the formation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which could significantly impact planetary space environments. Observations of eruptions involving polar crown filaments, situated in the polar regions of the Sun, are limited. In this study, we report a polar crown filament eruption (SOL2023-06-12), characterized by fast downflows below the filament. The downflows appear instantly after the onset of the filament eruption and persist for approximately 2 hours, exhibiting plane-of-sky (POS) velocities ranging between 92 and 144 km s$^{-1}$. They originate from the leading edge of the filament and no clear acceleration is observed. Intriguingly, these downflows appear at two distinct sites, symmetrically positioned at the opposite ends of the conjugate flare ribbons. Based on the observations, we propose that the filament might be supported by a magnetic flux rope (MFR), and these downflows possibly occur along the legs of the MFR. The downflows likely result from continuous reconnections between the MFR and the overlying magnetic field structures, and could either be reconnection outflows or redirected filament materials. We also observed horizontal drifting of the locations of downflows, which might correspond to the MFR's footpoint drifting. This type of downflows can potentially be utilized to track the footpoints of MFRs during eruptions.

 - **Abstract**
 The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) aims to detect highly inclined extensive air showers (EAS) with down-going and up-going trajectories. Several working groups in the GRAND collaboration are developing methods to reconstruct the incoming direction, core position, primary energy, and composition of the showers. The reconstruction pipeline -- currently under development in the France/IAP working group -- relies on a model of spherical wavefront emission for arrival times, which is possible because the radio signals are generated far away from the antenna stations. The amplitude distribution of the signals at the antenna level is described by an Angular Distribution Function that considers various asymmetries in the data, including geomagnetic effects. In this contribution, we present preliminary results from testing our EAS reconstruction procedure using realistic mock observations.
