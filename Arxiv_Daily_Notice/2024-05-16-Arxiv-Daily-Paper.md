 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS) combined with adaptive optics has been enormously successful in advancing our knowledge of exoplanet atmospheres, from chemistry to rotation and atmospheric dynamics. This powerful technique now drives major science cases for ELT instrumentation including METIS/ELT, GMTNIRS/GMT and MICHI/TMT, targeting biosignatures on rocky planets at 3-5 $\mu$m, but remains untested beyond 3.5 $\mu$m where the sky thermal background begins to provide the dominant contribution to the noise. We present 3.51-5.21 $\mu$m M-band CRIRES+/VLT observations of the archetypal young directly imaged gas giant $\beta$ Pictoris b, detecting CO absorption at S/N = 6.6 at 4.73 $\mu$m and H$_2$O at S/N = 5.7, and thus extending the use of HRCCS into the thermal background noise dominated infrared. Using this novel spectral range to search for more diverse chemistry we report marginal evidence of SiO at S/N = 4.3, potentially indicative that previously proposed magnesium-silicate clouds in the atmosphere are either patchy, transparent at M-band wavelengths, or possibly absent on the planetary hemisphere observed. The molecular detections are rotationally broadened by the spin of $\beta$ Pic b, and we infer a planetary rotation velocity of $v$sin(i) = 22$\pm$2 km s$^{-1}$ from the cross-correlation with the H$_2$O model template, consistent with previous K-band studies. We discuss the observational challenges posed by the thermal background and telluric contamination in the M-band, the custom analysis procedures required to mitigate these issues, and the opportunities to exploit this new infrared window for HRCCS using existing and next-generation instrumentation.

          Comparing bulge RR Lyrae stars with bulge giants -- Insight from 3D kinematics

 - **Abstract**
 The structure and kinematics of the old component of the Galactic bulge are still a matter of debate. The bulk of the bulge as traced by red clump stars includes two main components, which are usually identified as the metal-rich and metal-poor components. They have different shapes, kinematics, mean metallicities, and alpha-element abundances. It is our current understanding that they are associated with a bar and a spheroid, respectively. On the other hand, RR Lyrae variables trace the oldest population of the bulge. While it would be natural to think that they follow the structure and kinematics of the metal-poor component, the data analysed in the literature show conflicting results. We aim to derive a rotation curve for bulge RR Lyrae stars in order to determine that the old component traced by these stars is distinct from the two main components observed in the Galactic bulge. This paper combines APOGEE-2S spectra with OGLE-IV light curves, near-IR photometry, and proper motions from the VISTA Variables in the Ví a L\' actea survey for 4197 RR Lyrae stars. Six-dimensional phase-space coordinates were used to calculate orbits within an updated Galactic potential and to isolate the stars. The stars that stay confined within the bulge represent 57% of our sample. Our results show that bulge RR Lyrae variables rotate more slowly than metal-rich red clump stars and have a lower velocity dispersion. Their kinematics is compatible with them being the low-metallicity tail of the metal-poor component. We confirm that a rather large fraction of halo RR Lyrae stars pass by the bulge within their orbits, increasing the velocity dispersion. A proper orbital analysis is therefore critical to isolate bona fide bulge variables. Finally, bulge RR Lyrae seem to trace a spheroidal component, although the current data do now allow us to reach a firm conclusion about the spatial distribution.
#### Title:
          A temperature or FUV tracer? The HNC/HCN ratio in M83 on the GMC scale

 - **Abstract**
 The HNC/HCN ratio is observationally known as a thermometer in Galactic interstellar molecular clouds. A recent study has alternatively suggested that the HNC/HCN ratio is affected by the ultraviolet (UV) field, not by the temperature. We aim to study this ratio on the scale of giant molecular clouds in the barred spiral galaxy M83 towards the southwestern bar end and the central region from ALMA observations, and if possible, distinguish the above scenarios. We compare the high (40-50 pc) resolution HNC/HCN ratios with the star formation rate from the 3-mm continuum intensity and the molecular mass inferred from the HCN intensities. Our results show that the HNC/HCN ratios do not vary with the star formation rates, star formation efficiencies, or column densities in the bar-end region. In the central region, the HNC/HCN ratios become higher with higher star formation rates, which tend to cause higher temperatures. This result is not consistent with the previously proposed scenario in which the HNC/HCN ratio decreases with increasing temperature. Spectral shapes suggest that this trend may be due to optically thick HCN and optically thin HNC. In addition, we compare the large-scale ($\sim 200$ pc) correlation between the dust temperature from the FIR ratio and the HNC/HCN ratio for the southwestern bar-end region. The HNC/HCN ratio is lower when the dust temperatures are higher. We suggest from the above results that the HNC/HCN ratio depends on the UV radiation field that affects the interstellar medium on the $\sim100\,$pc scale where the column densities are low.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave signals from core-collapse supernovae are one of the important observables for extracting the information of dense matter. To extract the properties of proto-neutron stars produced via core-collapse supernovae by asteroseismology, we perform a linear perturbation analysis using data obtained from two-dimensional numerical simulations. We employ 12 and 20 solar-mass progenitors and compare two different treatments of gravity. One is a general relativistic one with a conformal flatness condition and the other is an effective gravitational potential mimicking the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff solution. We discuss how the frequencies of the proto-neutron star oscillations corresponding to the gravitational wave signals in the simulations depend on the proto-neutron star properties. In our models, we find that the gravitational wave frequencies of the proto-neutron stars determined with the Cowling approximation can be expressed to very good approximation as a function of the proto-neutron star average density almost independently of the progenitor mass, treatment of gravity in the simulations, and the interpolations in the simulations. On the other hand, if one considers the gravitational wave frequencies as a function of the surface gravity of proto-neutron stars, such a relation appears sensitive to the treatment of gravity and other numerical details in the simulations. Thus, the average density of proto-neutron stars seems more suitable for universally expressing the supernova gravitational wave frequencies, instead of the surface gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 Heating of charged particles via collisionless shocks, while ubiquitous in the universe, is an intriguing yet puzzling plasma phenomenon. One outstanding question is how electrons and ions approach an equilibrium after they were heated to different immediate-postshock temperatures. In order to fill the significant lack of observational information of the downstream temperature-relaxation process, we observe a thermal-dominant X-ray filament in the northwest of SN~1006 with Chandra. We divide this region into four layers with a thickness of 15$^{\prime\prime}$ or 0.16 pc each, and fit each spectrum by a non-equilibrium ionization collisional plasma model. The electron temperature was found to increase toward downstream from 0.52-0.62 keV to 0.82-0.95 keV on a length scale of 60 arcsec (or 0.64 pc). This electron temperature is lower than thermal relaxation processes via Coulomb scattering, requiring some other effects such as plasma mixture due to turbulence and/or projection effects, etc, which we hope will be resolved with future X-ray calorimeter missions such as XRISM and Athena.

 - **Abstract**
 The magnetic field of a molecular cloud core may play a role in the formation of circumstellar disks in the core. We present magnetic field morphologies in protostellar cores of 16 targets in the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array large program "Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk)", which resolved their disks with 7 au resolutions. The 0.1-pc scale magnetic field morphologies were inferred from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) POL-2 observations. The mean orientations and angular dispersions of the magnetic fields in the dense cores are measured and compared with the radii of the 1.3 mm continuum disks and the dynamically determined protostellar masses from the eDisk program. We observe a significant correlation between the disk radii and the stellar masses. We do not find any statistically significant dependence of the disk radii on the projected misalignment angles between the rotational axes of the disks and the magnetic fields in the dense cores, nor on the angular dispersions of the magnetic fields within these cores. However, when considering the projection effect, we cannot rule out a positive correlation between disk radii and misalignment angles in three-dimensional space. Our results suggest that the morphologies of magnetic fields in dense cores do not play a dominant role in the disk formation process. Instead, the sizes of protostellar disks may be more strongly affected by the amount of mass that has been accreted onto star+disk systems, and possibly other parameters, for example, magnetic field strength, core rotation, and magnetic diffusivity.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the development and commissioning of a new Q-band receiver for the Nobeyama 45-m telescope, covering 30--50 GHz with a receiver noise temperature of about 15 K. We name it eQ (extended Q-band) receiver. The system noise temperatures for observations are measured to be $\sim$ 30 K at 33 GHz and $\sim$ 75 K at 45 GHz. The Half-Power-Beam-Width (HPBW) is around 38\arcsec at 43 GHz. To enhance the observation capability, we tested the smoothed bandpass calibration technique and demonstrated the observation time can be significantly reduced compared to the standard position switch technique. The wide-bandwidth capability of this receiver provides precise determination of rest frequencies for molecular transitions with an accuracy of a few kHz through simultaneous observations of multiple transitions. Particularly, we determined the rest frequency of SO ($J_N$ = $1_0$--$0_1$) to be 30.001542 GHz, along with the rest frequency of CCS ($J_N$ = $4_3$--$3_2$) being 45.379033 GHz, adopting CCS ($J_N$ = $3_2$--$2_1$) at 33.751370 GHz as a reference line. The SO profile shows a double peak shape at the Cyanopolyyne Peak (CP) position of the Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 (TMC-1). The SO peaks coincide well with the CCS sub-components located near the outer parts of the TMC-1 filament. We interpret that the gravitational infall of TMC-1 generates shocks which enhance the SO abundance. The TMC-1 map shows that carbon-chain molecules are more abundant in the southern part of the filament, whereas SO is more abundant in the northern part. The eQ's excellent sensitivity allowed us to detect faint CO ($J$ = 1--0) spectra from the high-redshift object at a redshift of 2.442. Our receiver is expected to open new avenues for high-sensitivity molecular line observations in the Q-band.

 - **Abstract**
 This study employs Bayesian analysis and machine learning techniques to analyze the young open cluster NGC 6383 using data from Gaia DR3 and 2MASS. We identified 254 probable cluster members through HDBSCAN based on proper motions and determined the cluster's core and tidal radius. To perform this analysis, we utilized an extension of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, the No-U-Turn Sampler, using the Bayesian library PyMC. Our results indicate a mean cluster age of $4 \pm 1$ Myr and a distance of $1.107 \pm 0.035$ kpc. The analysis reveals mass segregation, especially among binary stars, and suggests that NGC 6383 is not fully relaxed. We observed a well-defined main sequence and a population of pre-main sequence stars, with a star formation range from $\sim 1$ to $6$ Myr, indicating recent star formation activity.

 - **Abstract**
 NASA's Juno mission provided exquisite measurements of Jupiter's gravity field that together with the Galileo entry probe atmospheric measurements constrains the interior structure of the giant planet. Inferring its interior structure range remains a challenging inverse problem requiring a computationally intensive search of combinations of various planetary properties, such as the cloud-level temperature, composition, and core features, requiring the computation of ~10^9 interior models. We propose an efficient deep neural network (DNN) model to generate high-precision wide-ranged interior models based on the very accurate but computationally demanding concentric MacLaurin spheroid (CMS) method. We trained a sharing-based DNN with a large set of CMS results for a four-layer interior model of Jupiter, including a dilute core, to accurately predict the gravity moments and mass, given a combination of interior features. We evaluated the performance of the trained DNN (NeuralCMS) to inspect its predictive limitations. NeuralCMS shows very good performance in predicting the gravity moments, with errors comparable with the uncertainty due to differential rotation, and a very accurate mass prediction. This allowed us to perform a broad parameter space search by computing only ~10^4 actual CMS interior models, resulting in a large sample of plausible interior structures, and reducing the computation time by a factor of 10^5. Moreover, we used a DNN explainability algorithm to analyze the impact of the parameters setting the interior model on the predicted observables, providing information on their nonlinear relation.

          Volatile atmospheres of lava worlds

 - **Abstract**
 A magma ocean (MO) is thought to be a ubiquitous stage in the early evolution of rocky planets and exoplanets. During the lifetime of the MO, exchanges between the interior and exterior envelopes of the planet are very efficient. In particular, volatile elements that initially are contained in the solid part of the planet can be released and form a secondary outgassed atmosphere. We determine trends in the H-C-N-O-S composition and thickness of these secondary atmospheres for varying planetary sizes and MO extents, and the oxygen fugacity of MOs, which provides the main control for the atmospheric chemistry. We used a model with coupled chemical gas-gas and silicate melt-gas equilibria and mass conservation to predict the composition of an atmosphere at equilibrium with the MO depending on the planet size and the extent and redox state of the MO. We used a self-consistent mass-radius model for the rocky core to inform the structure of the planet, which we combined with an atmosphere model to predict the transit radius of lava worlds. We find that MOs (especially the shallow ones) on small planets are generally more reduced, and are thus dominated by H2-rich atmospheres (whose outgassing is strengthened at low planetary mass), while larger planets and deeper MOs vary from CO to CO2-N2-SO2 atmospheres, with increasing fO2 . In the former case, the low molecular mass of the atmosphere combined with the low gravity of the planets yields a large vertical extension of the atmosphere, while in the latter cases, secondary outgassed atmospheres on super-Earths are likely significantly shrunk. Both N and C are largely outgassed regardless of the conditions, while the S and H outgassing is strongly dependent on the fO2 , as well as on the planetary mass and MO extent for the latter.

          Emergence of high-mass stars in complex fiber networks (EMERGE) II. The need for data combination in ALMA observations

 - **Abstract**
 ALMA's high-resolution images allow to resolve the filamentary structure of the ISM down to few thousand au at kpc distances. We aim to systematically quantify the impact of the interferometric response and the effects of the short-spacing information during the characterization of the ISM structure using ALMA observations. We create a series of continuum ALMA synthetic observations to test the recovery of the observational properties of dense cores and filaments (i.e. intensity peak, radial profile, and width) at different scales. We compare the results obtained with and without different data combination techniques using different ALMA arrays and SD telescopes in simulated data and real observations. Our analysis illustrates the severity of interferometric filtering effects. ALMA-12m alone observations show significant scale-dependent flux losses systematically corrupting (>30%error) all the physical properties inferred in cores and filaments (i.e. column density, mass, and size) before the maximum recoverable scale of the interferometer. These effects are only partially mitigated by the addition of the ALMA ACA-7m array although degrading the telescope PSF. Our results demonstrate only the addition of the ALMA Total Power information allows to recover the true sky emission down to few times the ALMA beamsize with satisfactory accuracy (<10% error). Additional tests demonstrate the emission recovery at all scales is further improved if the 7mTP data are replaced by maps obtained by a larger SD telescope (e.g., IRAM-30m), even if the latter are noisier than expected. These observational biases particularly affect partially resolved targets, becoming critical especially for studies in nearby regions such as Taurus or Orion. Our results demonstrate the need for the use of data combination techniques to accurately characterize the complex physical structure of the ISM in the ALMA era.
