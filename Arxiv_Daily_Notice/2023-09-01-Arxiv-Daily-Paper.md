#### The Missing Link: Testing Galactic Chemical Evolution Models with the  First Multi-Isotopic Abundances in Solar Twin Stars
 - **Authors:** David R. Coria, Ian J. M. Crossfield, Joshua Lothringer, Becky Flores, Nikos Prantzos, Richard Freedman

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first isotopic abundances of both $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O in solar twin stars and test the results against several galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models with different nucleosynthesis prescriptions. First, we compare M-band spectra from IRTF/iSHELL to synthetic spectra generated from custom solar atmosphere models using the PHOENIX atmosphere code. Next, we compare our calculated abundances to GCE models that consider isotopic yields from massive stars, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and fast-rotating stars. The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios determined for this sample of solar twins are consistent with predictions from the selected GCE models; however, the $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O ratios tentatively contradict these predictions. This project constitutes the first in a stellar chemical abundance series seeking to: (1) support the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as it characterizes exoplanet atmospheres, interiors, and biosignatures by providing host star abundances (2) identify how unexplored stellar abundances reveal the process of galactic chemical evolution and correlate with star formation, interior, age, metallicity, and activity; and (3) provide improved stellar ages using stellar abundance measurements. By measuring elemental and isotopic abundances in a variety of stars, we not only supply refined host star parameters, but also provide the necessary foundations for complementary exoplanet characterization studies and ultimately contribute to the exploration of galactic, stellar, and planetary origins and evolution.
#### The MUSE-Faint survey. IV. Dissecting Leo T, a gas-rich relic with  recent star formation

 - **Abstract**
 Leo T ($M_V = -8.0$) is both the faintest and the least massive galaxy known to contain neutral gas and to display signs of recent star formation. We analyse photometry and stellar spectra to identify member stars and to better understand the overall dynamics and stellar content of the galaxy and to compare the properties of its young and old stars. We use data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the VLT. We supplement this information with spectroscopic data from the literature and with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry. Our analysis reveals two distinct populations of stars in Leo T. The first population, with an age of $\lesssim 500~\mathrm{Myr}$, includes three emission-line Be stars comprising 15% of the total number of young stars. The second population of stars is much older, with ages ranging from $>5~\mathrm{Gyr}$ to as high as $10~\mathrm{Gyr}$. We combine MUSE data with literature data to obtain an overall velocity dispersion of $\sigma_{v} = 7.07^{+1.29}_{-1.12}~\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$ for Leo T. When we divide the sample of stars into young and old populations, we find that they have distinct kinematics. Specifically, the young population has a velocity dispersion of $2.31^{+2.68}_{-1.65}\,\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, contrasting with that of the old population, of $8.14^{+1.66}_{-1.38}\,\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. The fact that the kinematics of the cold neutral gas is in good agreement with the kinematics of the young population suggests that the recent star formation in Leo T is linked with the cold neutral gas. We assess the existence of extended emission-line regions and find none to a surface brightness limit of~$< 1\times 10^{-20}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}~\mathrm{arcsec}^{-2}$ which corresponds to an upper limit on star formation of $\sim 10^{-11}~\mathrm{M_\odot~yr^{-1}~pc^{-2}}$, implying that the star formation in Leo T has ended.

 - **Abstract**
 MoonBEAM is a SmallSat concept placed in cislunar orbit developed to study the progenitors and multimessenger/multiwavelength signals of transient relativistic jets and outflows and determine the conditions that lead to the launching of a transient relativistic jet. The advantage of MoonBEAM is the instantaneous all-sky coverage due to its orbit, which maximizes the gamma-raytransient observations and provides upperlimits for non-detections. Earth blockage and detector downtime from the high particle activity in the South Atlantic Anomaly region prevent gamma-ray observatories in low Earth orbit from surveying the entire sky at a given time. In addition, the long baseline provided from a cislunar orbit allows MoonBEAM to constrain the localization annulus when combined with a gamma-ray instrument in low Earth orbit utilizing the timing triangulation technique. We present the scientific performance of MoonBEAM including the expected effective area, localization ability and duty cycle. MoonBEAM provides many advantages to the gamma-ray and gravitational-wave follow up community by reducing the search region needed to identify the afterglow and kilanova emission. In addition, the all-sky coverage will provide insight into the conditions that lead to a successful relativistic jet, instead of a shock breakout event, or a completely failed jet in the case of core collapse supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter halos can enter a phase of gravothermal core--collapse in the presence of self-interactions. This phase that follows a core--expansion phase is thought to be subdominant due to the long time-scales involved. However, it has been shown that the collapse can be accelerated in tidal environments particularly for halos that are centrally concentrated. Cosmological simulations in $\Lambda$CDM give us the full distribution of satellite orbits and halo profiles in the universe. We use properties of the orbits and profiles of subhalos from simulations to estimate the fraction of the subhalos in different host halo environments, ranging from the Large Magellanic cloud(LMC)--like hosts to clusters, that are in the core--collapse phase. We use fluid simulations of self--interacting dark matter (SIDM) to evolve subhalos in their hosts including the effect of tidal truncation at the time of their pericenter crossing. We find that for parameters that allow the interaction cross-section to be high at dwarf scales, at least $10~\%$ of all subhalos are expected to have intrinsically collapsed within Hubble time up to the group mass host scales. This fraction increases significantly, becoming at least 20$\%$ when tidal interactions are considered. To identify these objects we find that we either need to measure their densities at very small radial scales, where the subhalos show a bimodal distribution of densities, or alternatively we need to measure the slopes of their inner density profiles near the scale radius, which are much steeper than NFW slopes expected in cold dark matter halos. Current measurements of central slopes of classical dwarfs do not show a preference for collapsed objects, however this is consistent with an SIDM scenario where the classical dwarfs are expected to be in a cored phase.
#### On the nature of the energy-dependent morphology of the composite  multi-TeV gamma-ray source HESS J1702-420

 - **Abstract**
 HESS J1702-420 is a multi-TeV gamma-ray source with an unusual energy-dependent morphology. The recent H.E.S.S. observations suggest that the emission is well described by a combination of point-like HESS J1702-420A (dominating at highest energies, $\gtrsim$ 30 TeV ) and diffuse ($\sim$ 0.3$^\circ$) HESS J1702-420B (dominating below $\lesssim$ 5TeV) sources with very hard (${\Gamma} \sim 1.5$) and soft (${\Gamma}$ ~2.6) power-law spectra, respectively. Here we propose a model which postulates that the proton accelerator is located at the position of HESS J1702-420A and is embedded into a dense molecular cloud that coincides with HESS J1702-420B. In the proposed model, the VHE radiation of HESS J1702-420 is explained by the pion-decay emission from the continuously injected relativistic protons propagating through a dense cloud. The energy-dependent morphology is defined by the diffusive nature of the low-energy protons propagation, transiting sharply to (quasi) ballistic propagation at higher energies. Adopting strong energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient, $D \propto E^\beta$ with $\beta \geq 1$, we argue that HESS J1702-420 as the system of two gamma-ray sources is the result of the propagation effect. Protons injected by a single accelerator at the rate $Q_0 \simeq 10^{38} \, (n_0/100 \, \rm cm^{-3})^{-1}\, (d/ \, 0.25\,kpc)^{-1} \rm erg/s$ can reasonably reproduce the morphology and fluxes of two gamma-ray components.

 - **Abstract**
 The JWST has captured the most detailed and sharpest infrared images ever taken of the inner region of the Orion Nebula, the nearest massive star formation region, and a prototypical highly irradiated dense photo-dissociation region (PDR). We investigate the fundamental interaction of far-ultraviolet photons with molecular clouds. The transitions across the ionization front (IF), dissociation front (DF), and the molecular cloud are studied at high-angular resolution. These transitions are relevant to understanding the effects of radiative feedback from massive stars and the dominant physical and chemical processes that lead to the IR emission that JWST will detect in many Galactic and extragalactic environments. Due to the proximity of the Orion Nebula and the unprecedented angular resolution of JWST, these data reveal that the molecular cloud borders are hyper structured at small angular scales of 0.1-1" (0.0002-0.002 pc or 40-400 au at 414 pc). A diverse set of features are observed such as ridges, waves, globules and photoevaporated protoplanetary disks. At the PDR atomic to molecular transition, several bright features are detected that are associated with the highly irradiated surroundings of the dense molecular condensations and embedded young star. Toward the Orion Bar PDR, a highly sculpted interface is detected with sharp edges and density increases near the IF and DF. This was predicted by previous modeling studies, but the fronts were unresolved in most tracers. A complex, structured, and folded DF surface was traced by the H2 lines. This dataset was used to revisit the commonly adopted 2D PDR structure of the Orion Bar. JWST provides us with a complete view of the PDR, all the way from the PDR edge to the substructured dense region, and this allowed us to determine, in detail, where the emission of the atomic and molecular lines, aromatic bands, and dust originate.
#### VLBI Observations of a sample of Palomar-Green quasars II:  characterising the parsec-scale radio emission

 - **Abstract**
 This study uses multi-frequency Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) to study the radio emission from 10 radio-quiet quasars (RQQs) and four radio-loud quasars (RLQs). The diverse morphologies, radio spectra, and brightness temperatures observed in the VLBI images of these RQQs, together with the variability in their GHz spectra and VLBI flux densities, shed light on the origins of their nuclear radio emission. The total radio emission of RQQs appears to originate from non-thermal synchrotron radiation due to a combination of active galactic nuclei and star formation activities. However, our data suggest that the VLBI-detected radio emission from these RQQs is primarily associated with compact jets or corona, with extended emissions such as star formation and large-scale jets being resolved by the high resolution of the VLBI images. Wind emission models are not in complete agreement the VLBI observations. Unlike RLQs, where the parsec-scale radio emission is dominated by a relativistically boosted core, the radio cores of RQQs are either not dominant or are mixed with significant jet emission. RQQs with compact cores or core-jet structures typically have more pronounced variability, with flat or inverted spectra, whereas jet-dominated RQQs have steep spectra and unremarkable variability. Future high-resolution observations of more RQQs could help to determine the fraction of different emission sources and their associated physical mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 We have mapped the NGC 2023 reflection nebula in the 63 and 145 micron transitions of [O I] and the 158 micron [C II] spectral lines using the heterodyne receiver upGREAT on SOFIA. The observations were used to identify the diffuse and dense components of the PDR traced by the [C II] and [O I] emission, respectively. The velocity-resolved observations reveal the presence of a significant column of low-excitation atomic oxygen, seen in absorption in the [O I] 63 micron spectra, amounting to about 20-60% of the oxygen column seen in emission in the [O I] 145 micron spectra. Some self-absorption is also seen in [C II], but for the most part it is hardly noticeable. The [C II] and [O I] 63 micron spectra show strong red- and blue-shifted wings due to photo evaporation flows especially in the southeastern and southern part of the reflection nebula, where comparison with the mid- and high-J CO emission indicates that the C+ region is expanding into a dense molecular cloud. Using a two-slab toy model the large-scale self-absorption seen in [O I] 63 micron is readily explained as originating in foreground low-excitation gas associated with the source. Similar columns have also been observed recently in other Galactic photon-dominated-regions (PDRs). These results have two implications: for the velocity-unresolved extra-galactic observations this could impact the use of [O I] 63 micron as a tracer of massive star formation and secondly the widespread self-absorption in [O I] 63 micron leads to underestimate of the column density of atomic oxygen derived from this tracer and necessitates the use of alternative indirect methods.
