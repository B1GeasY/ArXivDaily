 - **Abstract**
 AF Lep A+b is a remarkable planetary system hosting a gas-giant planet that has the lowest dynamical mass among directly imaged exoplanets. We present an in-depth analysis of the atmospheric composition of the star and planet to probe the planet's formation pathway. Based on new high-resolution spectroscopy of AF Lep A, we measure a uniform set of stellar parameters and elemental abundances (e.g., [Fe/H] = $-0.27 \pm 0.31$ dex). The planet's dynamical mass ($2.8^{+0.6}_{-0.5}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$) and orbit are also refined using published radial velocities, relative astrometry, and absolute astrometry. We use petitRADTRANS to perform chemically-consistent atmospheric retrievals for AF Lep b. The radiative-convective equilibrium temperature profiles are incorporated as parameterized priors on the planet's thermal structure, leading to a robust characterization for cloudy self-luminous atmospheres. This novel approach is enabled by constraining the temperature-pressure profiles via the temperature gradient $(d\ln{T}/d\ln{P})$, a departure from previous studies that solely modeled the temperature. Through multiple retrievals performed on different portions of the $0.9-4.2$ $\mu$m spectrophotometry, along with different priors on the planet's mass and radius, we infer that AF Lep b likely possesses a metal-enriched atmosphere ([Fe/H] $> 1.0$ dex). AF Lep b's potential metal enrichment may be due to planetesimal accretion, giant impacts, and/or core erosion. The first process coincides with the debris disk in the system, which could be dynamically excited by AF Lep b and lead to planetesimal bombardment. Our analysis also determines $T_{\rm eff} \approx 800$ K, $\log{(g)} \approx 3.7$ dex, and the presence of silicate clouds and dis-equilibrium chemistry in the atmosphere. Straddling the L/T transition, AF Lep b is thus far the coldest exoplanet with suggested evidence of silicate clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first extragalactic detection of the higher-order millimeter hydrogen recombination lines ($\Delta n>2$). The $\gamma$-, $\epsilon$-, and $\eta$-transitions have been detected toward the millimeter continuum source N105-1A in the star-forming region N105 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We use the H40$\alpha$ line, the brightest of the detected recombination lines (H40$\alpha$, H36$\beta$, H50$\beta$, H41$\gamma$, H57$\gamma$, H49$\epsilon$, H53$\eta$, and H54$\eta$), and/or the 3 mm free-free continuum emission to determine the physical parameters of N105-1A (the electron temperature, emission measure, electron density, and size) and study ionized gas kinematics. We compare the physical properties of N105-1A to a large sample of Galactic compact and ultracompact (UC) H II regions and conclude that N105-1A is similar to the most luminous ($L>10^5$ $L_{\odot}$) UC H II regions in the Galaxy. N105-1A is ionized by an O5.5 V star, it is deeply embedded in its natal molecular clump, and likely associated with a (proto)cluster. We incorporate high-resolution molecular line data including CS, SO, SO$_2$, and CH$_3$OH ($\sim$0.12 pc), and HCO$^{+}$ and CO ($\sim$0.087 pc) to explore the molecular environment of N105-1A. Based on the CO data, we find evidence for a cloud-cloud collision that likely triggered star formation in the region. We find no clear outflow signatures, but the presence of filaments and streamers indicates on-going accretion onto the clump hosting the UC H II region. Sulfur chemistry in N105-1A is consistent with the accretion shock model predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos play pivotal roles in determining fluid dynamics, nucleosynthesis, and their observables in core-collapse supernova (CCSN) and binary neutron star merger (BNSM). In this Letter, we present a novel phenomenon, collisional flavor swap, in which neutrino-matter interactions trigger the complete interchange of neutrino spectra between two different flavors, aided by neutrino self-interactions. We find a necessary condition to trigger the collisional swap is occurrences of resonance-like collisional flavor instability. After the collisional swap, spectral-swap like features emerge in neutrino spectra. Since flavor swaps correspond to the most extreme case in flavor conversions, they have a great potential to affect CCSN and BNSM phenomena.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the FRB population using the first CHIME/FRB catalog. We first reconstruct the extragalactic dispersion measure -- redshift relation ($\mathrm{DM_E} - z$ relation) from well-localized FRBs, then use it to infer redshift and isotropic energy of the first CHIME/FRB catalog. The intrinsic energy distribution is modeled by the power law with an exponential cutoff, and the selection effect of the CHIME telescope is modeled by a two-parametric function of specific fluence. For the intrinsic redshift distribution, the star formation history (SFH) model, as well as other five SFH-related models are considered. We construct the joint likelihood of fluence, energy and redshift, and all the free parameters are constrained simultaneously using Bayesian inference method. The Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is used to choose the model that best matches the observational data. For comparison, we fit our models with two data samples, i.e. the Full sample and the Gold sample. The power-law index and cutoff energy are tightly constrained to be $1.8 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim 2.0$ and $\mathrm{log}(E_c/{\rm erg}) \approx 42.5$, which are almost independent of the redshift distribution model and the data sample we choose. The parameters involving the selection effect strongly depends on the data sample, but are insensitive to the redshift distribution model. According to BIC, the pure SFH model is strongly disfavored by both the Full sample and Gold sample. For the rest five SFH-related redshift distribution models, most of them can match the data well if the parameters are properly chosen. Therefore, with the present data, it is still premature to draw a conclusive conclusion on the FRB population.

 - **Abstract**
 We present 5 deg^2 (~250 pc^2) HCN, HNC, HCO+, and CO J=1-0 maps of the Orion B GMC, complemented with existing wide-field [CI] 492 GHz maps, as well as new pointed observations of rotationally excited HCN, HNC, H13CN, and HN13C lines. We detect anomalous HCN J=1-0 hyperfine structure line emission almost everywhere in the cloud. About 70% of the total HCN J=1-0 luminosity arises from gas at A_V < 8 mag. The HCN/CO J=1-0 line intensity ratio shows a bimodal behavior with an inflection point at A_V < 3 mag typical of translucent gas and UV-illuminated cloud edges. We find that most of the HCN J=1-0 emission arises from extended gas with n(H2) < 10^4 cm^-3, even lower density gas if the ionization fraction is > 10^-5 and electron excitation dominates. This result explains the low-A_V branch of the HCN/CO J=1-0 intensity ratio distribution. Indeed, the highest HCN/CO ratios (~0.1) at A_V < 3 mag correspond to regions of high [CI] 492 GHz/CO J=1-0 intensity ratios (>1) characteristic of low-density PDRs. Enhanced FUV radiation favors the formation and excitation of HCN on large scales, not only in dense star-forming clumps. The low surface brightness HCN and HCO+ J=1-0 emission scale with I_FIR (a proxy of the stellar FUV radiation field) in a similar way. Together with CO J=1-0, these lines respond to increasing I_FIR up to G0~20. On the other hand, the bright HCN J=1-0 emission from dense gas in star-forming clumps weakly responds to I_FIR once the FUV radiation field becomes too intense (G0>1500). The different power law scalings (produced by different chemistries, densities, and line excitation regimes) in a single but spatially resolved GMC resemble the variety of Kennicutt-Schmidt law indexes found in galaxy averages. As a corollary for extragalactic studies, we conclude that high HCN/CO J=1-0 line intensity ratios do not always imply the presence of dense gas.
