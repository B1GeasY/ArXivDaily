#### Mass-Radius relation for magnetized white dwarfs from SDSS

 - **Abstract**
 We present the observational mass-radius (M-R) relation for a sample of 47 magnetized white dwarfs (WDs) with the magnetic field strength (B) ranging from 1 to 773 MG, identified from the SDSS data release 7 (DR7). We derive their effective temperature, surface gravity (log g), luminosity, radius, and mass. While atmospheric parameters are derived using a Virtual Observatory Spectral Energy Distribution Analyzer (VOSA), the mass is derived using their location in the HR diagram in comparison with the evolutionary tracks of different masses. We implement this mass measurement instead of a more traditional method of deriving masses from log g, which is unreliable as is based on SED and generates errors from other physical parameters involved. The main disadvantage of this method is that we need to assume a core composition of WDs. As it is complicated to identify the exact composition of these WDs from low-resolution spectra, we use tracks for the masses 0.2 to 0.4 solar mass assuming a He-core, 0.5 to 1.0 solar mass assuming CO core, and above solar mass assuming O-Ne-Mg core. We compare the observed M-R relation with those predicted by the finite temperature model by considering different B, which are well in agreement considering their relatively low surface fields, less than or of the order of 10^9 G. Currently, there is no direct observational detection of magnetized WDs with B > 10^9 G. We propose that our model can be further extrapolated to higher B, which may indicate the existence of super-Chandrasekhar mass (M > 1.4 solar mass) WDs at higher B.
#### Lepto-Hadronic Scenarios for TeV Extensions of Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglow  Spectra

 - **Abstract**
 Recent multi-wavelength observations of gamma-ray burst afterglows observed in the TeV energy range challenge the simplest Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) interpretation of this emission, and are consistent with a single power-law component spanning over eight orders of magnitude in energy. To interpret this generic behaviour in the single-zone approximation without adding further free parameters, we perform an exhaustive parameter space study using the public, time-dependent, multi-messenger transport software AM3. This description accounts for the radiation from non-thermal protons and the lepto-hadronic cascade induced by pp- and p{\gamma}-interactions. We summarise the main scenarios which we have found (SSC, Extended-syn, Proton-syn, pp-cascade, and p{\gamma}-cascade), and discuss their advantages and limitations. We find that possible high-density environments, as may be typical for surrounding molecular cloud material, offer an alternative explanation for producing flat hard (source) spectra up to and beyond energies of 10 TeV.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new method for joint likelihood deconvolution (Jolideco) of a set of astronomical observations of the same sky region in the presence of Poisson noise. The observations may be obtained from different instruments with different resolution, and different point spread functions. Jolideco reconstructs a single flux image by optimizing the posterior distribution based on the joint Poisson likelihood of all observations under a patch-based image prior. The patch prior is parameterised via a Gaussian Mixture model which we train on high-signal-to-noise astronomical images, including data from the James Webb Telescope and the GLEAM radio survey. This prior favors correlation structures among the reconstructed pixel intensities that are characteristic of those observed in the training images. It is, however, not informative for the mean or scale of the reconstruction. By applying the method to simulated data we show that the combination of multiple observations and the patch-based prior leads to much improved reconstruction quality in many different source scenarios and signal to noise regimes. We demonstrate that with the patch prior Jolideco yields superior reconstruction quality relative to alternative standard methods such as the Richardson-Lucy method. We illustrate the results of Jolideco applied to example data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Fermi-LAT Gamma-ray Space Telescope. By comparing the measured width of a counts based and the corresponding Jolideco flux profile of an X-ray filament in SNR 1E 0102.2-721} we find the deconvolved width of 0.58+- 0.02 arcsec to be consistent with the theoretical expectation derived from the known width of the PSF.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the Voyager mission flybys in 1979, we have known the moon Io to be extremely volcanically active as well as to be the main source of plasma in the vast magnetosphere of Jupiter. Material lost from Io forms neutral clouds, the Io plasma torus and ultimately the extended plasma sheet. This material is supplied from the upper atmosphere and atmospheric loss is likely driven by plasma-interaction effects with possible contributions from thermal escape and photochemistry-driven escape. Direct volcanic escape is negligible. The supply of material to maintain the plasma torus was estimated from various methods at roughly one ton per second. Most of the time the magnetospheric plasma environment of Io is stable on timescales from days to months. Similarly, Io's atmosphere was found to have a stable average density on the dayside, although it exhibits lateral, diurnal and seasonal variations. There is a potential positive feedback in the Io torus supply: collisions of torus plasma with atmospheric neutrals likely are a significant loss process, which increases with torus density. The stability of the torus environment might be maintained by limiting mechanisms of either torus supply from Io or the loss from the torus by centrifugal interchange in the middle magnetosphere. Various observations suggest that occasionally the plasma torus undergoes major transient changes over a period of several weeks, apparently overcoming possible stabilizing mechanisms. Such events (and more frequent minor changes) are commonly explained by some kind of change in volcanic activity that triggers a chain of reactions which modify the plasma torus state via a net increase in supply of new mass. However, it remains unknown what kind of volcanic event can trigger torus events, whether Io's atmosphere undergoes a change before or during such magnetospheric events, and what processes could enable such a change.
#### CO outflows from young stars in the NGC2023 cluster

 - **Abstract**
 Young early-type HAeBe stars are still embedded in the molecular clouds in which they formed. They illuminate reflection nebulae, which shape the surrounding molecular cloud and may trigger star formation. They are therefore ideal places to search for ongoing star formation activity. NGC2023 is illuminated by the Herbig Be star HD37903. It is the most massive member of a small young cluster with about 30 PMS stars, several of which are Class I objects that still heavily accrete. It might therefore be expected that they might drive molecular outflows. We examined the whole region for outflows. We analyzed previously published APEX data to search for and characterize the outflows in the NGC2023 region. This is the first systematic search for molecular outflows in this region. Since the outflows were mapped in several CO transitions, we can determine their properties quite well. We have discovered four molecular outflows in the vicinity of NGC2023, three of which are associated with Class I objects. MIR-63, a bright mid-infrared and submillimeter Class I source, is a binary with a separation of 2.4" and drives two bipolar outflows orthogonal to each other. The large southeast-northwest outflow excites the Herbig-Haro flow HH247. MIR-73, a Class I object, which is also a far-infrared source, drives a pole-on outflow. MIR-62 is a Class II object with strong infrared excess and a luminosity of 7 Lsun. It is not detected in the far-infrared. The Class I sources have bolometric luminosities of about 20 Lsun or lower, that is, they are all low-mass stars. One other far-infrared source, MIR-75, may have powered an outflow in the past because it now illuminates an egg-shaped cavity. The four outflow sources are at a similar evolutionary stage, which suggests that their formation may have been triggered by the expanding C II region.

 - **Abstract**
 Period change studies give a window to probe into the evolution and dynamics of Cepheids. While evolutionary period changes have been well studied both observationally and theoretically, non-evolutionary period changes lack a systematic and quantitative description. The overall objective is to have a quantitative understanding of the full picture of non-evolutionary period changes in Cepheids, to develop a formalism to disentangle it from the secular evolutionary period change. In the first part of the series of works, we aim to conduct a systematic search for non-evolutionary period changes to search for Cepheids in likely binary configuration and quantify their incidence rates in the Magellanic Clouds. We collect more than decade-long time-series photometry from the publically available survey, Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE), with more than 7200 Cepheids collectively from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Our sample contains both fundamental-mode and first overtone-mode Cepheids. Then we calculate observed minus calculated ($O-C$) diagrams to reveal the light-travel time effect (LTTE). In our search, out of an overall sample of more than 7200 Cepheids, we found 52 candidate Cepheid binary systems in the LMC (30 fundamental and 22 first overtone-mode) and 145 in the SMC (85 fundamental and 60 first overtone-mode). The majority of the sample is characterized by orbital periods of 2000-4000\,d and eccentricities of 0.2-0.5. Moreover, we report two candidates in each galaxy with the Cepheid likely existing with a giant companion. The incidence rate ratio for SMC to LMC calculated from our sample is in agreement with binary Cepheid population synthesis predictions.
#### The disappearance of the blue and luminous progenitor of the Type IIn SN  2010jl

 - **Abstract**
 Type IIn supernovae (SNe) exhibit narrow hydrogen lines that arise from the strong interaction between ejecta and circumstellar material. It remains poorly understood, however, what progenitor stars give rise to these explosions. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of the progenitor and environment of the nearby Type IIn SN 2010jl. With newer images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, we confirm that the previously reported progenitor candidate is a blend of the progenitor itself and a field star cluster in its close vicinity. SN 2010jl has now become much fainter than the progenitor. The progenitor is very blue and luminous with an effective temperature of log $T_{\rm eff}/{\rm K}$=4.26$^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$ and a luminosity of log $L/L_{\odot}$ =6.52$^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$. It is located in a very young star-forming region, but its luminosity is much higher than that expected from the environmental stellar populations. We suggest that the progenitor was in outburst when observed. Its nature and evolutionary history remain to be investigated.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and gravimeters on Earth and in space can potentially offer the most accurate direct measurement of local density of near-Earth asteroid-mass Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and Dark Matter (DM) clumps in the solar system by means of gravitational influence. Using semi-analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulation, this paper revisits the analysis of the trajectories of DM clumps in the solar system, including both captured objects and hyperbolic trajectories. A link is thus made between the frequency and distance of Earth overflights for a given mass flux, and a direct measure of dark matter clump density in the solar system. We then model the signature of a close flyby of a DM object on orbital data from GNSS satellites and gravity measurements from gravimeters. We thus obtain a first assessment of the single probe sensitivity. It paves the way for an exhaustive statistical analysis of 28 years of gravimeters and GNSS data to obtain observational constraints on the density of the PBHs and DM clumps within the solar system, for the mass range $[10^8-10^{17}]$ kg. In addition, our methodology offers a possibility of direct detection in cases where DM clumps are endowed with an additional long-range clump-matter fifth-force beyond gravity.
#### Search for protostellar jets with UWISH2 in the molecular cloud  complexes Vulpecula and IRDC G53.2

 - **Abstract**
 Jets and outflows are the early signposts of stellar birth. Using the UKIRT Wide Field Infrared Survey for H2 (UWISH2) at 2.12 micron, 127 outflows are identified in molecular cloud complexes Vulpecula OB1 and IRDC G53.2 covering 12 square degrees of the Galactic plane. Using multi-wavelength datasets, from 1.2 to 70 micron, 79 young stellar objects (YSOs) are proposed as potential driving sources, where, $\sim$ 79% are likely Class 0/I protostars, 17% are Class II YSOs and the remaining 4% are Class III YSOs. The outflows are characterized in terms of their length, flux, luminosity and knot-spacing. The identified outflows have a median lobe length of 0.22 pc and 0.17 pc for outflows in Vulpecula OB1 and IRDC G53.2, respectively. Our analysis, from the knot spacing, reveals a typical ejection frequency of $\sim$ 1.2 kyr suggesting an intermediate type between the FU-Ori and EX-Ori type of eruptions in both cloud complexes. Furthermore, the physical parameters of the driving sources are obtained by performing radiative transfer modelling to the observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs), which suggest that the outflows are driven by intermediate mass stars. Various observed trends between the outflow properties and the corresponding driving sources, and various interesting outflows and star forming sites, including sites of triggered star formation and protocluster forming clump with clusters of jets, are discussed. The obtained results and the identified jet-bearing protostellar sample will pave the way to understand many aspects of outflows with future high-resolution observations.
