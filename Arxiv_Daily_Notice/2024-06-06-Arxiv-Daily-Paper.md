 - **Abstract**
 Core collapse initial conditions are a bottleneck in understanding the explosion mechanism(s) of massive stars. Stellar evolution codes struggle after carbon burning, and either stop or adopt numerical simplifications missing crucial physics. The use of small nuclear reaction networks (NRN) that account for energy production but bypass weak reactions is typical, but insufficient to study the dynamics of the collapse. We advise against the use of progenitors computed with small NRN in expensive multi-dimensional simulations of core collapse, bounce, (jet formation), and explosion.
#### The R-Process Alliance: 2MASS J22132050-5137385, the Star with the Highest-known r-process Enhancement at [Eu/Fe] = +2.45

 - **Abstract**
 We present stellar parameters and chemical abundances of 47 elements detected in the bright (V = 11.63) very metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -2.20 +- 0.12) star 2MASS J22132050-5137385. We observed this star using the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrograph as part of ongoing work by the R-Process Alliance. The spectrum of 2MASS J22132050-5137385 exhibits unusually strong lines of elements heavier than the iron group, and our analysis reveals that these elements were produced by rapid neutron-capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis. We derive a europium enhancement, [Eu/Fe] = +2.45 +- 0.08, that is higher than any other r-process-enhanced star known at present. This star is only the eighth r-process-enhanced star where both thorium and uranium are detected, and we calculate the age of the r-process material, 13.6 +- 2.6 Gyr, from the radioactive decay of these isotopes. This star contains relatively large enhancements of elements that may be produced as transuranic fission fragments, and we propose a new method using this characteristic to assess the r-process yields and gas dilution in samples of r-process-enhanced stars. We conclude that 2MASS J22132050-5137385 exhibits a high level of r-process enhancement because it formed in an environment where the r-process material was less diluted than average. Assuming a canonical baryonic minihalo mass of 10^6 M_sun and a 1 percent metal retention rate, this star formed in a cloud of only ~ 600 M_sun.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal jets are believed to be the miniature version of large-scale solar eruptions. In particular, the eruption of a mini-filament inside the base arch is suggested to be the trigger and even driver of blowout jets. Here we propose an alternative triggering mechanism, based on high-resolution H-alpha observations of a blowout jet associated with a mini-filament and an M1.2-class flare. The mini-filament remains largely stationary during the blowout jet, except that it is straddled by flare loops connecting two flare ribbons, indicating that the magnetic arcade embedding the mini-filament has been torn into two parts, with the upper part escaping with the blowout jet. In the wake of the flare, the southern end of the mini-filament fans out like neighboring fibrils, indicative of mass and field exchanges between the mini-filament and the fibrils. The blowout jet is preceded by a standard jet. With H-alpha fibrils moving toward the single-strand spire in a sweeping fashion, the standard jet transitions to the blowout jet. The similar pattern of standard-to-blowout jet transition occurs in an earlier C-class flare before the mini-filament forms. The spiraling morphology and sweeping direction of these fibrils are suggestive of their footpoints being dragged by the leading sunspot that undergoes clockwise rotation for over two days. Soon after the sunspot rotation reaches a peak angular speed as fast as 10 deg/hr, the dormant active region becomes flare-productive, and the mini-filament forms through the interaction of moving magnetic features from the rotating sunspot with satellite spots/pores. Hence, we suggest that the sunspot rotation plays a key role in building up free energy for flares and jets and in triggering blowout jets by inducing sweeping motions of fibrils.
#### Event-horizon-scale Imaging of M87* under Different Assumptions via Deep Generative Image Priors

 - **Abstract**
 Reconstructing images from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87, depends on a prior to impose desired image statistics. However, given the impossibility of directly observing black holes, there is no clear choice for a prior. We present a framework for flexibly designing a range of priors, each bringing different biases to the image reconstruction. These priors can be weak (e.g., impose only basic natural-image statistics) or strong (e.g., impose assumptions of black-hole structure). Our framework uses Bayesian inference with score-based priors, which are data-driven priors arising from a deep generative model that can learn complicated image distributions. Using our Bayesian imaging approach with sophisticated data-driven priors, we can assess how visual features and uncertainty of reconstructed images change depending on the prior. In addition to simulated data, we image the real EHT M87* data and discuss how recovered features are influenced by the choice of prior.
#### An Expanded Set of Los Alamos OPLIB Tables in MESA: Type-1 Rosseland-mean Opacities and Solar Models

 - **Abstract**
 We present a set of 1194 Type-1 Rosseland-mean opacity tables for four different metallicity mixtures. These new Los Alamos OPLIB atomic radiative opacity tables are an order of magnitude larger in number than any previous opacity table release, and span regimes where previous opacity tables have not existed. For example, the new set of opacity tables expands the metallicity range to $Z$\,=\,10$^{-6}$ to $Z$\,=\,0.2 which allows improved accuracy of opacities at low and high metallicity, increases the table density in the metallicity range $Z$\,=\,10$^{-4}$ to $Z$\,=\,0.1 to enhance the accuracy of opacities drawn from interpolations across neighboring metallicities, and adds entries for hydrogen mass fractions between $X$\,=\,0 and $X$\,=\,0.1 including $X$\,=\,$10^{-2}, 10^{-3}, 10^{-4}, 10^{-5}, 10^{-6}$ that can improve stellar models of hydrogen deficient stars. We implement these new OPLIB radiative opacity tables in \MESA, and find that calibrated solar models agree broadly with previously published helioseismic and solar neutrino results. We find differences between using the new 1194 OPLIB opacity tables and the 126 OPAL opacity tables range from $\approx$\,20--80\% across individual chemical mixtures, up to $\approx$\,8\% and $\approx$\,15\% at the bottom and top of the solar convection zone respectively, and $\approx$\,7\% in the solar core. We also find differences between standard solar models using different opacity table sources that are on par with altering the initial abundance mixture. We conclude that this new, open-access set of OPLIB opacity tables does not solve the solar modeling problem, and suggest the investigation of physical mechanisms other than the atomic radiative opacity.

 - **Abstract**
 The possibility of slow diffusion regions as the origin for extended TeV emission halos around some pulsars (such as PSR J0633+1746 and PSR B0656+14) challenges the standard scaling of the electron diffusion coefficient in the interstellar medium. Self-generated turbulence by electron-positron pairs streaming out of the pulsar wind nebula was proposed as a possible mechanism to produce the enhanced turbulence required to explain the morphology and brightness of these TeV halos. We perform fully kinetic 1D3V particle-in-cell simulations of this instability, considering the case where streaming electrons and positrons have the same density. This implies purely resonant instability as the beam does not carry any current. We compare the linear phase of the instability with analytical theory and find very reasonable agreement. The non-linear phase of the instability is also studied, which reveals that the intensity of saturated waves is consistent with a momentum exchange criterion between a decelerating beam and growing magnetic waves. With the adopted parameters, the instability-driven wavemodes cover both the Alfvénic (fluid) and kinetic scales. The spectrum of the produced waves is non-symmetric, with left-handed circular polarisation waves being strongly damped when entering the ion-cyclotron branch, while right-handed waves are suppressed at smaller wavelength when entering the Whistler branch. The low-wavenumber part of the spectrum remains symmetric when in the Alfvénic branch. As a result, positrons behave dynamically differently compared to electrons. We also observed a second harmonic plasma emission in the wave spectrum. An MHD-PIC approach is warranted to probe hotter beams and investigate the Alfvén branch physics. This work confirms that the self-confinement scenario develops essentially according to analytical expectations [...](abridged)
#### Prominence and coronal rain formation by steady versus stochastic heating and how we can relate it to observations

 - **Abstract**
 Prominences and coronal rain are two forms of coronal condensations for which we still lack satisfactory details on the formation pathways and conditions under which the two come to exist. We compared prominences that formed via a steady versus stochastic type of heating. We performed 2.5D simulations using the open-source MPI-AMRVAC code. To further extend the work and allow for future direct comparison with observations, we used Lightweaver to form spectra of the filament view of our steady case prominence. With that, we analysed a reconnection event that shares certain characteristics with nanojets. We show how different forms of localised heating that induce thermal instability result in prominences with different properties. The steady form of heating results in prominence with a clear vertical structure stretching across the magnetic field lines. On the other hand, stochastic heating produces many threads that predominantly have a horizontal motion along the field lines. In the steady heating case, the prominence is relatively static; however, there is evidence of reconnection happening almost the entire time the prominence is present. In the case of stochastic heating, the threads are highly dynamic, with them also exhibiting a form of transverse oscillation (strongly resembling the decayless type). The fact that the threads in the stochastic heating case are constantly moving along the field lines suppresses any conditions for reconnection. It, therefore, appears that, to first order, the choice of heating prescription defines whether the prominence-internal dynamics are oriented vertically or horizontally. We closely inspected a sample reconnection event and computed the synthetic optically thick radiation using the open-source Lightweaver radiative transfer framework.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent high-resolution and sensitivity ALMA observations have unveiled the carbon isotope ratios ($^{12}$C/$^{13}$C) of Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in a low-mass protostellar source. To understand the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs, we investigated the carbon isotope fractionation of COMs from prestellar cores to protostellar cores with a gas-grain chemical network model. We confirmed that the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of small molecules are bimodal in the prestellar phase: CO and species formed from CO (e.g., CH$_{3}$OH) are slightly enriched in $^{13}$C compared to the local ISM (by $\sim$ 10 $\%$), while those from C and C$^{+}$ are depleted in $^{13}$C owing to isotope exchange reactions. COMs are mainly formed on the grain surface and in the hot gas ($>$ 100 K) in the protostellar phase. The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs depend on which molecules the COMs are formed from. In our base model, some COMs in the hot gas are depleted in $^{13}$C compared to the observations. Thus, We additionally incorporate reactions between gaseous atomic C and H$_{2}$O ice or CO ice on the grain surface to form H$_2$CO ice or \ce{C2O} ice, as suggested by recent laboratory studies. The direct C-atom addition reactions open pathways to form \ce{^13C}-enriched COMs from atomic C and CO ice. We find that these direct C-atom addition reactions mitigate $^{13}$C-depletion of COMs, and the model with the direct C-atom addition reactions better reproduces the observations than our base model. We also discuss the impact of the cosmic ray ionization rate on the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of COMs.

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes threaded by massive vector fields can be subject to a superradiant instability, growing a cloud of massive vector particles around it. In this work, we consider what happens if such a dark matter candidate field mimicking a dark photon interacts with an accretion flow onto the black hole. By including a kinetic mixing term with the standard model photon, we extend the commonly used equations of general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics to a dark photon constituent. The coupling to the dark photon then appears as an effective dynamo term together with a dark Lorentz force acting on the accreting matter. We numerically study the interactions between the superradiant dark photon cloud and the inner accretion flow by solving the coupled system in full numerical relativity. By parameterically varying the mixing parameter between dark and standard model sector, we provide a first investigation of how the accretion flow could be modified. Depending on the coupling strength, our solutions exhibit increased wind launching, as well as oscillation modes in the disk.

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs are the remnants of stars not massive enough to become supernovae. This review explores the concept of strange dwarfs, a unique class of white dwarfs which contain cores of strange quark matter. Strange dwarfs have different sizes, masses, and evolutionary paths with respect to white dwarfs. They might form through the accumulation of normal matter on strange quark stars or by capture of strangelets. The stability of strange dwarfs has been debated, with initial studies suggesting stability, while later analyses indicated potential instability. This review revisits these discussions, focusing on the critical role of boundary conditions between nuclear and quark matter in determining stability. It also offers insights into their formation, structure, and possible detection in the universe.

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs offer a unique opportunity to search nearby stellar systems for signs of life, but the habitable zone around these stars is still poorly understood. Since white dwarfs are compact stars with low luminosity, any planets in their habitable zone should be tidally locked, like planets around M-dwarfs. Unlike planets around M-dwarfs, however, habitable white dwarf planets have to rotate very rapidly, with orbital periods ranging from hours to several days. Here we use the ExoCAM Global Climate Model (GCM) to investigate the inner edge of the habitable zone (HZ) around white dwarfs. Our simulations show habitable planets with ultrashort orbital periods ($P\lesssim$1 day) enter a ``bat rotation" regime, which differs from typical atmospheric circulation regimes around M dwarfs. Bat rotators feature mean equatorial subrotation and a displacement of the surface's hottest regions from the equator towards the midlatitudes. We qualitatively explain the onset of bat rotation using shallow water theory. The resulting circulation shifts increase dayside cloud cover and decrease stratospheric water vapor, expanding the white dwarf habitable zone by $\sim$50\% compared to estimates based on 1D models. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) should be able to quickly characterize bat rotators around nearby white dwarfs thanks to their distinct thermal phase curves. Our work underlines that tidally locked planets on ultrashort orbits may exhibit unique atmospheric dynamics, and guides future habitability studies of white dwarf systems.
#### A case study of gas impacted by black-hole jets with the JWST: outflows, bow shocks, and high excitation of the gas in the galaxy IC5063

 - **Abstract**
 We present James Webb Space Telescope MIRI data of the inner ~3x2 kpc^2 of the galaxy IC5063, in which the jets of a supermassive black hole interact with the gaseous disk they are crossing. Jet-driven outflows were known to be initiated along or near the jet path, and the stability conditions of clouds were known to vary because of these outflows. The MIRI data, of unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in the infrared, now reveal that there are more than ten discrete regions with outflows, nearly doubling the number of such known regions. Outflows exist near the radio lobes, at the nucleus, in a biconical structure perpendicular to the jet, and in a bubble moving against the disk. In some of them, velocities above escape velocity are observed. Stratification is also observed, with higher ionization or excitation gas attaining higher velocities. More outflows and bow shocks, found further away from the nucleus than the radio lobes, in regions without significant radio emission, reveal the existence of past or weak radio jets that interacted with the interstellar medium. The coincidence of the bow shocks with the optical extended emission line region (EELR) suggests that the jets also contributed to the gas ionization. Maps of the H2 gas excitation temperature, T_ex, indicate that the molecular gas is most excited in regions with radio emission. There, T_ex is more than 100K higher than in the EELR interior. We argue that a combination of jet-related shocks and cosmic rays is likely responsible for this excess molecular gas excitation.
#### A comprehensive analysis toward the Fermi-LAT source 4FGL J1846.9-0227 -- Jets of a proto-planetary nebula producing gamma-rays?

 - **Abstract**
 Most of the gamma-ray sources in the Fermi-LAT 14-year Source Catalog are associated with pulsars and blazars. However, unveiling the nature of the still unassociated gamma-ray sources is important for the understanding of high energy emission mechanisms in astrophysical objects. This work presents a comprehensive study toward the region covered by the Fermi source 4FGL J1846.9$-$0227 previously suggested to be a blazar or a massive protostar. Using multiwavelength observations, we analyzed several astrophysical objects in the region as possible counterparts of the Fermi-LAT source. Having discarded most of them after a comprehensive analysis, we suggest that the most likely candidate to be such a counterpart is IRAS 18443$-$0231. We discovered that this source, previously cataloged as a planetary nebula candidate, actually is a proto-planetary nebula. The radio continuum image at 3 GHz associated with such a nebula allowed us to identify a jet-like structure. Additionally, we identified an associated red-shifted CO molecular outflow and a dense molecular clump in which the source is embedded. We obtained a radio spectral index of $-0.47 \pm 0.08$ for the source, indicating syncrothron emission due to accelerated particles. Thus, we suggest that processes such as proton-proton collisions and relativistic Bremsstrahlung are likely to occur. IRAS 18443$-$0231, lying almost at the center of the Fermi confidence ellipse and related to the hard X-ray source 4XMM J184700.4$-$022752, would be the first association between a proto-planeatry nebula and gamma emission.
#### Detection of extended gamma-ray emission in the vicinity of Cl Danks 1 and 2

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of high-energy gamma-ray emission towards the G305 star-forming region. Using almost 15 years of observation data from {\sl Fermi} Large Area Telescope, we detected an extended gamma-ray source in this region with a significance of $\sim 13 \sigma$. The gamma-ray radiation reveals a clear pion-bump feature and can be fitted with the power law parent proton spectrum with an index of $-2.5$. The total cosmic ray (CR) proton energy in the gamma-ray production region is estimated to be the order of $10^{49}\ \rm erg$. We further derived the CR radial distribution from both the gamma-ray emission and gas distribution and found it roughly obeys the $1/r$ type profile, which is consistent with other similar systems and expected from the continuous injection of CRs by the central powerful young massive star cluster Danks 1 or Danks 2 in this region. Together with former detections of similar gamma-ray structures, such as Cygnus cocoon, Westerlund 1, Westerlund 2, NGC 3603, and W40, the detection supports the hypothesis that young massive star clusters are CR accelerators.
#### Probing the distinct extinction law of the Pillars of Creation in M16 with JWST

 - **Abstract**
 Investigating the extinction law in regions of high dust extinction, such as the Pillars of Creation within the M16 region, is crucial for understanding the densest parts of the interstellar medium (ISM). In this study, we utilize observations from the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to analyze the color-excess ratios $E(F090W-\lambda)/E(F090W-F200W)$ across a wavelength range of $0.9-7.7\,\mu\mathrm{m}$. Our method involves performing linear regression on color-color diagrams to derive these ratios. The enhanced detection capabilities of JWST data allow us to probe the distinct extinction law to the densest regions in M16 corresponding to an extinction depth up to $A_V \sim 60$\,mag. Remarkably, the resultant color-excess ratio curve exhibits a flatter profile than predicted by typical dust extinction models with $R_V = 5.5$ for dense ISM environments. Moreover, we observe that the mid-infrared (MIR) extinction law diverges from the near-infrared (NIR) power-law, showing a tendency for the slope to flatten as the wavelength increases. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the dust properties in dense interstellar environments.
