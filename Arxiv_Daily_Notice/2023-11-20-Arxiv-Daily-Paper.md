 - **Abstract**
 We announce the C23.01 update of Cloudy. This corrects a simple coding error, present since $\sim$ 1990, in one routine that required a conversion from the line-center to the mean normalization of the Ly$\alpha$ optical depth. This affects the destruction of H I Ly$\alpha$ by background opacities. Its largest effect is upon the Ly$\alpha$ intensity in high-ionization dusty clouds, where the predicted intensity is now up to three times stronger. Other properties that depend on Ly$\alpha$ destruction, such as grain infrared emission, change in response.
#### The abundance discrepancy in ionized nebulae: which are the correct  abundances?

 - **Abstract**
 Ionized nebulae are key to understanding the chemical composition and evolution of the Universe. Among these nebulae, H~{\sc ii} regions and planetary nebulae are particularly important as they provide insights into the present and past chemical composition of the interstellar medium, along with the nucleosynthetic processes involved in the chemical evolution of the gas. However, the heavy-element abundances derived from collisional excited lines (CELs) and recombination lines (RLs) do not align. This longstanding abundance-discrepancy problem calls into question our absolute abundance determinations. Which of the lines (if any) provides the correct heavy-element abundances? Recently, it has been shown that there are temperature inhomogeneities concentrated within the highly ionized gas of the H~{\sc ii} regions, causing the reported discrepancy. However, planetary nebulae do not exhibit the same trends as the H~{\sc ii} regions, suggesting a different origin for the abundance discrepancy. In this proceedings, we briefly discuss the state-of-the-art of the abundance discrepancy problem in both H~{\sc ii} regions and planetary nebulae.
#### Forming Giant Planets Around Late-M Dwarfs: Pebble Accretion and  Planet-Planet Collision

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a pebble-driven core accretion scenario to explain the formation of giant planets around the late-M dwarfs of $M_{\star}{=}0.1{-}0.2 \ M_{\odot}$. In order to explore the optimal disk conditions for giant planet, we perform N-body simulations to investigate the growth and dynamical evolution of both single and multiple protoplanets in the disks with both inner viscously heated and outer stellar irradiated regions. The initial masses of the protoplanets are either assumed to be equal to $0.01 \ M_{\oplus}$ or calculated based on the formula derived from streaming instability simulations. Our findings indicate that massive planets are more likely to form in disks with longer lifetimes, higher solid masses, moderate to high levels of disk turbulence, and larger initial masses of protoplanets. In the single protoplanet growth cases, the highest planet core mass that can be reached is generally lower than the threshold necessary to trigger rapid gas accretion, which impedes the formation of giant planets. Nonetheless, in multi-protoplanet cases, the cores can exceed the pebble isolation mass barrier aided by frequent planet-planet collisions. This consequently speeds up their gas accretion and promotes giant planet formation, making the optimal parameter space to grow giant planets substantially wider. Taken together, our results suggest that even around very low-mass stellar hosts, the giant planets with orbital periods of ${\lesssim}100$ days are still likely to form when lunar-mass protoplanets first emerge from planetesimal accretion and then grow rapidly by a combination of pebble accretion and planet-planet collisions in disks with a high supply of pebble reservoir ${>}50 \ M_{\oplus}$ and turbulent level of $\alpha_{\rm t} {\sim} 10^{-3}{-}10^{-2}$.
#### Realtime Follow-up of External Alerts with the IceCube Supernova Data  Acquisition System

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is uniquely sensitive to MeV neutrinos emitted during a core-collapse supernova. The Supernova Data Acquisition System (SNDAQ) monitors in real-time the detector rate deviation searching for bursts of MeV neutrinos. We present a new analysis stream that uses SNDAQ to respond to external alerts from gravitational waves detected in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA.
#### Gravity-Induced Ice Compaction and Subsurface Porosity on Icy Moons

 - **Abstract**
 Our understanding of the surface porosity of icy moons and its evolution with depth remains limited, including the precise scale at which ice compaction occurs under self-weight pressure. This parameter is of crucial interest for the correct interpretation of current remote sensing data (spectroscopy in the visible, infrared to passive microwave) but also for planetary exploration when designing a lander, a rover or a cryobot. In situ exploration of the ice crust would require knowledge about subsurface porosity. This study employs a compaction model solely driven by overburden pressure based on prior research. The formulation for density as a function of depth, incorporates an essential parameter: the ice compaction coefficient. To determine this coefficient, we fit our depth-dependent density model to existing data obtained from Earth-based measurements of ice cores in Antarctica and North Greenland. Our results yield a typical lengthscale for ice compaction on Earth of approximately 20.1 $\pm$ 0.6 m , consistent with the existing literature. We apply the model to Europa, which due to its lower gravity, has a typical ice compaction scale of 150 $\pm$ 4 m. We compare it with the depths scanned by current spaceborne data and find that porosity can be considered constant when accounting only for gravity-induced compaction.
#### Absolutely Scintillating: constraining $ν$ mass with black  hole-forming supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 The terrestrial detection of a neutrino burst from the next galactic core-collapse supernova (CCSN) will provide profound insight into stellar astrophysics, as well as fundamental neutrino physics. Using Time-Of-Flight (ToF) effects, a CCSN signal can be used to constrain the absolute neutrino mass. In this work, we study the case where a black hole forms during core-collapse, abruptly truncating the neutrino signal. This sharp cutoff is a feature that can be leveraged in a ToF study, enabling strict limits to be set on the neutrino mass which are largely model-independent. If supernova neutrinos are detected on Earth in liquid scintillator detectors, the exceptional energy resolution would allow an energy-dependent sampling of the ToF effects at low neutrino energies. One promising experimental program is the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), a next-generation liquid scintillator detector currently under construction in China. Using three-dimensional black hole-forming core-collapse supernova simulations, the sensitivity of a JUNO-like detector to the absolute neutrino mass is conservatively estimated to be $m_\nu < 0.39^{+0.06}_{-0.01}$ eV for a 95% CL bound. A future-generation liquid scintillator observatory like THEIA-100 could even achieve sub-0.2 eV sensitivity.
#### Collection, Collation, and Comparison of 3D Coronal CME Reconstructions

 - **Abstract**
 Predicting the impacts of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is a major focus of current space weather forecasting efforts. Typically, CME properties are reconstructed from stereoscopic coronal images and then used to forward model a CME's interplanetary evolution. Knowing the uncertainty in the coronal reconstructions is then a critical factor in determining the uncertainty of any predictions. A growing number of catalogs of coronal CME reconstructions exist, but no extensive comparison between these catalogs has yet been performed. Here we develop a Living List of Attributes Measured in Any Coronal Reconstruction (LLAMACoRe), an online collection of individual catalogs, which we intend to continually update. In this first version, we use results from 24 different catalogs with 3D reconstructions using STEREO observations between 2007--2014. We have collated the individual catalogs, determining which reconstructions correspond to the same events. LLAMACoRe contains 2954 reconstructions for 1863 CMEs. Of these, 510 CMEs contain multiple reconstructions from different catalogs. Using the best-constrained values for each CME, we find that the combined catalog reproduces the generally known solar cycle trends. We determine the typical difference we would expect between two independent reconstructions of the same event and find values of 4.0 deg in the latitude, 8.0 deg in the longitude, 24.0 deg in the tilt, 9.5 deg in the angular width, 0.1 in the shape parameter kappa, 115 km/s in the velocity, and 2.5e15 g in the mass. These remain the most probable values over the solar cycle, though we find more extreme outliers in the deviation toward solar maximum.
