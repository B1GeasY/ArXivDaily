#### What does perturbative QCD really have to say about neutron stars

 - **Abstract**
 The implications of perturbative QCD (PQCD) calculations on neutron stars are carefully examined. While PQCD calculations above baryon chemical potential $\mu_B\sim2.4$ GeV demonstrate the potential of ruling out a wide range of neutron star equations of state (EOSs), these types of constraints only affect the most massive neutron stars in the vicinity of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit, resulting in bounds on neutron star EOSs that are orthogonal to those from current or future astrophysical observations, even if observations near the TOV limit are made. Assuming the most constraining scenario, PQCD considerations favor low values of the speed of sound squared $C_s$ at high $\mu_B$ relevant for heavy neutron stars, but leave predictions for the radii and tidal deformabilities almost unchanged for all the masses. Such considerations become irrelevant if the maximum speed of sound squared inside neutron stars does not exceed about $C_{s,\mathrm{max}}\sim0.5$, or if the matching to PQCD is performed above $\mu_B\simeq2.9$ GeV. Furthermore, the large uncertainties associated with the current PQCD predictions make it impossible to place any meaningful bounds on neutron star EOSs as of now. Interestingly, if PQCD predictions for pressure at around $\mu_B\simeq2.4$ GeV is refined and found to be low ($\lesssim 1.5$ GeV/fm$^3$), evidence for a soft neutron star inner core EOS would point to the presence of a strongly interacting phase dominated by non-perturbative physics beyond neutron star densities.

 - **Abstract**
 The fast flavor conversions (FFCs) of neutrinos generally exist in core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron-star merger remnants, and can significantly change the flavor composition and affect the dynamics and nucleosynthesis processes. Several analytical prescriptions were proposed recently to approximately explain or predict the asymptotic outcome of FFCs for systems with different initial or boundary conditions, with the aim for providing better understandings of FFCs and for practical implementation of FFCs in hydrodynamic modeling. In this work, we obtain the asymptotic survival probability distributions of FFCs in a survey over thousands of randomly sampled initial angular distributions by means of numerical simulations in one-dimensional boxes with the periodic boundary condition. We also propose improved prescriptions that guarantee the continuity of the angular distributions after FFCs. Detailed comparisons and evaluation of all these prescriptions with our numerical survey results are performed. The survey dataset is made publicly available to inspire the exploration and design for more effective methods applicable to realistic hydrodynamic simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Short-lived radioisotopes, in particular 26-Al and 60-Fe, are thought to contribute to the internal heating of the Earth, but are significantly more abundant in the Solar System compared to the Interstellar Medium. The presence of their decay products in the oldest Solar System objects argues for their inclusion in the Sun's protoplanetary disc almost immediately after the star formation event that formed the Sun. Various scenarios have been proposed for their delivery to the Solar System, usually involving one or more core-collapse supernovae of massive stars. An alternative scenario involves the young Sun encountering an evolved Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star. AGBs were previously discounted as a viable enrichment scenario for the Solar System due to the presumed low probability of an encounter between an old, evolved star and a young pre-main sequence star. We report the discovery in Gaia data of an interloping AGB star in the star-forming region NGC2264, demonstrating that old, evolved stars can encounter young forming planetary systems. We use simulations to calculate the yields of 26-Al and 60-Fe from AGBs and their contribution to the long-term geophysical heating of a planet, and find that these are comfortably within the range previously calculated for the Solar System.
#### Filament fragmentation: Density gradients suppress end dominated  collapse

 - **Abstract**
 The onset of star formation is set by the collapse of filaments in the interstellar medium. From a theoretical point of view, an isolated cylindrical filament forms cores via the edge effect. Due to the self-gravity of a filament, the strong increase in acceleration at both ends leads to a pile-up of matter which collapses into cores. However, this effect is rarely observed. Most theoretical models consider a sharp density cut-off at the edge of the filament, whereas a smoother transition is more realistic and would also decrease the acceleration at the ends of the filament. We show that the edge effect can be significantly slowed down by a density gradient, although not completely avoided. However, this allows perturbations inside the filament to grow faster than the edge. We determine the critical density gradient for which the timescales are equal and find it to be of the order of several times the filament radius. Hence, the density gradient at the ends of a filament is an essential parameter for fragmentation and the low rate of observed cases of the edge effect could be naturally explained by shallow gradients.
#### Thermal Behavior of Astrophysical Amorphous Molecular Ices

 - **Abstract**
 Ice is a major component of astrophysical environment - from interstellar molecular clouds through protoplanetary disks to evolved solar systems. Ice and complex organic matter coexist in these environments as well, and it is thought primordial ice brought the molecules of life to Earth four billion years ago, which could have kickstarted the origin of life on Earth. To understand the journey of ice and organics from their origins to becoming a part of evolved planetary systems, it is important to complement high spatial and spectral resolution telescopes such as JWST with laboratory experimental studies that provide deeper insight into the processes that occur in these astrophysical environments. Our laboratory studies are aimed at providing this knowledge. In this article we present simultaneous mass spectrometric and infrared spectroscopic investigation on how molecular ice mixtures behave at different temperatures and how this information is critical to interpret observational data from protoplanetary disks as well as comets. We find that amorphous to crystalline water ice transformation is the most critical phenomenon that differentiates between outgassing of trapped volatiles such as CO2 vs. outgassing of pure molecular ice domains of the same in a mixed molecular ice. Crystalline water ice is found to trap only a small fraction of other volatiles (<5%), indicating ice grain composition in astrophysical and planetary environments must be different depending on whether the ice is in amorphous phase or transformed into crystalline phase, even if the crystalline ice undergoes radiation-induced amorphization subsequently. Crystallization of water ice is a key differentiator for many ices in astronomical environments as well as in our Solar System.

 - **Abstract**
 The GAIA space mission is impacting astronomy in many significant ways by providing a uniform, homogeneous and precise data set for over 1 billion stars and other celestial objects in the Milky Way and beyond. Exoplanet science has greatly benefited from the unprecedented accuracy of stellar parameters obtained from GAIA. In this study, we combine photometric, astrometric, and spectroscopic data from the most recent Gaia DR3 to examine the kinematic and chemical age proxies for a large sample of 2611 exoplanets hosting stars whose parameters have been determined uniformly. Using spectroscopic data from the Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) onboard GAIA, we show that stars hosting massive planets are metal-rich and $\alpha$-poor in comparison to stars hosting small planets. The kinematic analysis of the sample reveals that the stellar systems with small planets and those with giant planets differ in key aspects of galactic space velocity and orbital parameters, which are indicative of age. We find that the galactic orbital parameters have a statistically significant difference of 0.06 kpc for $Z_{max}$ and 0.03 for eccentricity respectively. Furthermore, we estimated the stellar ages of the sample using the MIST-MESA isochrone models. The ages and its proxies for the planet-hosting stars indicate that the hosts of giant planetary systems are younger compared to the population of stars harboring small planets. These age trends are also consistent with the chemical evolution of the galaxy and the formation of giant planets from the core-accretion process.
#### First glycine isomer detected in the interstellar medium: glycolamide  (NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$OH)

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detection in the interstellar medium of a C$_2$H$_5$O$_2$N isomer: $syn$-glycolamide (NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$OH). The exquisite sensitivity at sub-mK levels of an ultra-deep spectral survey carried out with the Yebes 40m and IRAM 30m telescopes towards the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud have allowed us to unambiguously identify multiple transitions of this species. We derived a column density of (7.4 $\pm$ 0.7)$\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, which implies a molecular abundance with respect to H$_2$ of 5.5$\times$10$^{-11}$. The other C$_2$H$_5$O$_2$N isomers, including the higher-energy $anti$ conformer of glycolamide, and two conformers of glycine, were not detected. The upper limit derived for the abundance of glycine indicates that this amino acid is surely less abundant than its isomer glycolamide in the ISM. The abundances of the C$_2$H$_5$O$_2$N isomers cannot be explained in terms of thermodynamic equilibrium, and thus chemical kinetics need to be invoked. While the low abundance of glycine might not be surprising, based on the relative low abundances of acids in the ISM compared to other compounds (e.g. alcohols, aldehydes or amines), several chemical pathways can favour the formation of its isomer glycolamide. It can be formed through radical-radical reactions on the surface of dust grains. The abundances of these radicals can be significantly boosted in an environment affected by a strong ultraviolet field induced by cosmic rays, such as that expected in G+0.693-0.027. Therefore, as shown by several recent molecular detections towards this molecular cloud, it stands out as the best target to discover new species with carbon, oxygen and nitrogen with increasing chemical complexity.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurately estimating the C/O ratio of hot Jupiter atmospheres is a promising pathway towards understanding planet formation and migration, as well as the formation of clouds and the overall atmospheric composition. The atmosphere of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b has been extensively analysed using low-resolution observations with HST and Spitzer, but these previous observations did not cover the K band, which hosts prominent spectral features of major carbon-bearing species such as CO and CH$_{4}$. As a result, the ability to establish precise constraints on the C/O ratio was limited. Moreover, the planet has not been studied at high spectral resolution, which can provide insights into the atmospheric dynamics. In this study, we present the first high-resolution dayside spectra of WASP-43b with the new CRIRES$^+$ spectrograph. By observing the planet in the K band, we successfully detected the presence of CO and provide evidence for the existence of H$_2$O using the cross-correlation method. This discovery represents the first direct detection of CO in the atmosphere of WASP-43b. Furthermore, we retrieved the temperature-pressure profile, abundances of CO and H$_2$O, and a super-solar C/O ratio of 0.78 by applying a Bayesian retrieval framework to the data. Our findings also shed light on the atmospheric characteristics of WASP-43b. We found no evidence for a cloud deck on the dayside, and recovered a line broadening indicative of an equatorial super-rotation corresponding to a jet with a wind speed of $\sim$ 5 km s$^{-1}$, matching the results of previous forward models and low-resolution atmospheric retrievals for this planet.
