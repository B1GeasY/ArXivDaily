 - **Abstract**
 Stars with initial masses larger than 8 solar masses undergo substantial mass loss through mechanisms that remain elusive. Unraveling the origins of this mass loss is important for comprehending the evolutionary path of these stars, the type of supernova explosion and whether they become neutron stars or black hole remnants. In 2022 December, RW Cep experienced the Great Dimming in its visible brightness, presenting a unique opportunity to understand mass loss mechanisms. Our previous observations of RW Cep from the CHARA Array, taken during the dimming phase, show a compelling asymmetry in the star images, with a darker zone on the west side of the star indicating presence of dust in front of the star in our line of sight. Here, we present multi-epoch observations from CHARA while the star re-brightened in 2023. We created images using three image reconstruction methods and an analytical model fit. Comparisons of images acquired during the dimming and re-brightening phases reveal remarkable differences. Specifically, the west side of RW Cep, initially obscured during the dimming phase, reappeared during the subsequent re-brightening phase and the measured angular diameter became larger by 8%. We also observed image changes from epoch to epoch while the star is brightening indicating the time evolution of dust in front of the star. We suggest that the dimming of RW Cep was a result from a recent surface mass ejection event, generating a dust cloud that partially obstructed the stellar photosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 In the late stages of accretion leading up to the formation of planetesimals, particles grew to pebbles the size of 1-mm to tens of cm. That is the same size range that dominates the present-day comet mass loss. Meteoroids that size cause visible meteors on Earth. Here, we hypothesize that the size distribution and the physical and chemical properties of young meteoroid streams still contain information about the conditions in the solar nebula during these late stages of accretion. From observations of 47 young meteor showers, we find that freshly ejected meteoroids from long-period comets tend to have low bulk density and are distributed with equal surface area per log-mass interval (magnitude distribution index chi ~ 1.85), suggesting gentle accretion conditions. Jupiter-family comets, on the other hand, mostly produce meteoroids twice as dense and distributed with a steeper chi ~ 2.15 or even chi ~ 2.5, which implies that those pebbles grew from particles fragmenting in a collisional cascade or by catastrophic collisions, respectively. Both comet populations contain an admixture of compact materials that are sometimes sodium-poor, but Jupiter-family comets show a higher percentage (~8% on average) than long-period comet showers (~4%), and a wider range. While there are exceptions in both groups, the implication is that most long-period comets formed under gentle particle growth conditions, possibly near the 30 AU edge of the Trans Neptunian Disk, while most Jupiter family comets formed closer to the Sun where pebbles reached or passed the fragmentation barrier. This is possible if the Scattered Disk represents all objects scattered by Neptune during its migration, while the present-day outer Oort cloud formed only during and after the Sun had moved away from sibling stars.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years the amount of publicly available astronomical data has increased exponentially, with a remarkable example being large scale multiepoch photometric surveys. This wealth of data poses challenges to the classical methodologies commonly employed in the study of variable objects. As a response, deep learning techniques are increasingly being explored to effectively classify, analyze, and interpret these large datasets. In this paper we use two-dimensional histograms to represent Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) phasefolded light curves as images. We use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify variable objects within eight different categories (from now on labels): Classical Cepheid (CEP), RR Lyrae (RR), Long Period Variable (LPV), Miras (M), Ellipsoidal Binary (ELL), Delta Scuti (DST), Eclipsing Binary (E), and spurious class with Incorrect Periods (Rndm). We set up different training sets to train the same CNN architecture in order to characterize the impact of the training. The training sets were built from the same source of labels but different filters and balancing techniques were applied. Namely: Undersampling (U), Data Augmentation (DA), and Batch Balancing (BB). The best performance was achieved with the BB approach and a training sample size of $\sim$370000 stars. Regarding computational performance, the image representation production rate is of $\sim$76 images per core per second, and the time to predict is $\sim$ 60$\, \mu\text{s}$ per star. The accuracy of the classification improves from $\sim$ 92%, when based only on the CNN, to $\sim$ 98% when the results of the CNN are combined with the period and amplitude features in a two step approach. This methodology achieves comparable results with previous studies but with two main advantages: the identification of miscalculated periods and the improvement in computational time cost.

 - **Abstract**
 Protostellar disks around young protostars exhibit diverse properties, with their radii ranging from less than ten to several hundred au. To investigate the mechanisms shaping this disk radius distribution, we compiled a sample of 27 Class 0 and I single protostars with resolved disks and dynamically determined protostellar masses from the literature. Additionally, we derived the radial profile of the rotational to gravitational energy ratio in dense cores from the observed specific angular momentum profiles in the literature. Using these observed protostellar masses and rotational energy profile, we computed theoretical disk radii from the hydrodynamic and non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models in Lee et al. (2021, 2024) and generated synthetic samples to compare with the observations. In our theoretical model, the disk radii are determined by hydrodynamics when the central protostar+disk mass is low. After the protostars and disks grow and exceed certain masses, the disk radii become regulated by magnetic braking and non-ideal MHD effects. The synthetic disk radius distribution from this model matches well with the observations. This result suggests that hydrodynamics and non-ideal MHD can be dominant in different mass regimes (or evolutionary stages) depending on the rotational energy and protostar+disk mass. This model naturally explains the rarity of large (>100 au) disks and the presence of very small (<10 au) disks. It also predicts that the majority of protostellar disks have radii of a few tens of au, as observed.

 - **Abstract**
 The diffuse Galactic $\gamma$-ray emission originates from the interactions between cosmic rays and the interstellar medium or radiation fields within our Galaxy, where the production of neutrinos is also anticipated. Recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) reported measurements of diffuse $\gamma$-rays from the Galactic plane with energies ranging from sub-TeV to 1 PeV. Using publicly available 7 years of IceCube track data with the full detector, we conduct a template search using the $\gamma$-ray flux map observed by LHAASO-KM2A as the neutrino emission template and perform a scan search of the Galactic plane. In the template search, a mild excess of neutrinos is observed in the Galactic plane with a pretrial significance of $1.9\sigma$. The measured muon neutrino intensity at 25 TeV is $4.73^{+2.53}_{-2.51}\times10^{-14}\,{\rm TeV^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,sr^{-1}}$, consistent with the expected neutrino flux assuming that all the diffuse Galactic $\gamma$-rays originate from hadronic interactions. In the Galactic plane scan search, the most significant location is found at $l=63.57^{\circ}$ and $b=0.93^{\circ}$ with a pretrial (posttrial) significance of $4.6\sigma$ ($1.8\sigma$).

 - **Abstract**
 The slowly positively drifting bursts (SPDBs) are rarely observed in radio emission of solar flares. To understand how the SPDBs are generated, we studied the radio observations at 600--5000 MHz together with the imaging observations made in ultraviolet (UV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) during the SPDB-rich C8.7 flare of 2014 May 10 (SOL2014-05-10T0702). Because the SPDBs propagate towards locations of higher plasma density, we studied their associations with individual flare kernels, located either within the flare core itself, or distributed at longer distances, but connected to the flaring region by large-scale hot loops. For each kernel we constructed light curves using 1600 A and 304 A observations and compared these light curves with the temporal evolution of radio flux at 1190 MHz, representing all observed groups of SPDBs. We also analysed the UV/EUV observations to understand the evolution of magnetic connectivity during the flare. The flare starts with a growing hot sigmoid observed in 131 A. As the sigmoid evolves, it extends to and interacts with a half dome present within the active region. The evolving sigmoid reconnects at the respective hyperbolic flux tube, producing large-scale magnetic connections and an EUV swirl. Three groups of SPDBs are observed during this large-scale magnetic reconnection, along with a group of narrow-band type III bursts. The light curves of a kernel corresponding to the footpoint of spine line analogue show good agreement with the radio flux at 1190 MHz, indicating that the SPDBs are produced by the large-scale magnetic reconnection at the half dome. In addition, one of the kernels appeared in the neighbouring active region and also showed a similar evolution to the radio flux, implying that beams of accelerated particles can synchronize radio and UV/EUV light curves across relatively large distances.

 - **Abstract**
 High energy photons originating from the Galactic Center (GC) region have the potential to undergo significant photon-axion-like particle (ALP) oscillation effects, primarily induced by the the presence of intense magnetic fields in this region. Observations conducted by imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes have detected very high energy gamma-rays originating from a point source known as HESS J1745-290, situated in close proximity to the GC. This source is conjectured to be associated with the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A$^*$. The GC region contains diverse structures, including molecular clouds and non-thermal filaments, which collectively contribute to the intricate magnetic field configurations in this region. By utilizing a magnetic field model specific in the GC region, we explore the phenomenon of photon-ALP oscillations in the gamma-ray spectrum of HESS J1745-290. Our analysis does not reveal any discernible signature of photon-ALP oscillations, yielding significant constraints that serve as a complement to gamma-ray observations of extragalactic sources across a broad parameter region. The uncertainties arising from the outer Galactic magnetic field models have minor impacts on our results, except for ALP masses around 10$^{-7}$ eV, as the dominant influence originates from the intense magnetic field strength in the inner GC region.
#### Massive stars exploding in a He-rich circumstellar medium $-$ X. Flash spectral features in the Type Ibn SN 2019cj and observations of SN 2018jmt

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical and near-infrared observations of two Type Ibn supernovae (SNe), SN 2018jmt and SN 2019cj. Their light curves have rise times of about 10 days, reaching an absolute peak magnitude of $M_g$(SN 2018jmt) = $-$19.07 $\pm$ 0.37 and $M_V$(SN 2019cj) = $-$18.94 $\pm$ 0.19 mag, respectively. The early-time spectra of SN 2018jmt are dominated by a blue continuum, accompanied by narrow (600$-$1000 km~s$^{-1}$) He I lines with P-Cygni profile. At later epochs, the spectra become more similar to those of the prototypical SN Ibn 2006jc. At early phases, the spectra of SN 2019cj show flash ionisation emission lines of C III, N III and He II superposed on a blue continuum. These features disappear after a few days, and then the spectra of SN 2019cj evolve similarly to those of SN 2018jmt. The spectra indicate that the two SNe exploded within a He-rich circumstellar medium (CSM) lost by the progenitors a short time before the explosion. We model the light curves of the two SNe Ibn to constrain the progenitor and the explosion parameters. The ejecta masses are consistent with either that expected for a canonical SN Ib ($\sim$ 2 M$_{\odot}$) or those from a massive WR star ($>$ $\sim$ 4 M$_{\odot}$), with the kinetic energy on the order of $10^{51}$ erg. The lower limit on the ejecta mass ($>$ $\sim$ 2 M$_{\odot}$) argues against a scenario involving a relatively low-mass progenitor (e.g., $M_{ZAMS}$ $\sim$ 10 M$_{\odot}$). We set a conservative upper limit of $\sim$0.1 M$_{\odot}$ for the $^{56}$Ni masses in both SNe. From the light curve modelling, we determine a two-zone CSM distribution, with an inner, flat CSM component, and an outer CSM with a steeper density profile. The physical properties of SN 2018jmt and SN 2019cj are consistent with those expected from the core collapse of relatively massive, stripped-envelope (SE) stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the dynamical and physical structures of bright-rimmed clouds (BRCs) in a nearby HII region. We focused on carbon- and oxygen-bearing species that trace photon-dominated regions (PDRs) and warm molecular cloud surfaces in order to understand the effect of UV radiation from the exciting stars on the cloud structure. We mapped four regions around the most prominent BRCs at scales of 4--10 arcmin in the HII region IC 1396 in [CII] 158 micron with (up)GREAT on board SOFIA. IC 1396 is predominantly excited by an O6.5V star. Toward IC 1396A, we also observed [OI] 63 micron and 145 micron. We combined these observations with JCMT archive data, which provide the low-J transitions of CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O. All spectra are velocity-resolved. The line profiles show a variety of velocity structures, which we investigated in detail for all observed emission lines. We find no clear sign of photoevaporating flows in the [CII] spectra, although the uncertainty in the location of the BRCs along the line of sight makes this interpretation inconclusive. Our analysis of the [$^{13}$CII] emission in IC 1396A suggests that the [CII] is likely mostly optically thin. The heating efficiency, measured by the ([CII]+[OI] 63 micron)/far-infrared intensity ratio, is higher in the northern part of IC 1396A than in the southern part, which may indicate a difference in the dust properties of the two areas. The complex velocity structures identified in the BRCs of IC 1396, which is apparently a relatively simple HII region, highlight the importance of velocity-resolved data for disentangling different components along the line of sight and thus facilitating a detailed study of the dynamics of the cloud. We also demonstrate that the optically thin [$^{13}$CII] and [OI] 145 micron emission lines are essential for a conclusive interpretation of the [CII] 158 micron and [OI] 63 micron line profiles.
#### Unveiling the Physics of Core-Collapse Supernovae with the Line Emission Mapper: Observing Cassiopeia A

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) Core-collapse supernova remnants (SNRs) display complex morphologies and asymmetries, reflecting anisotropies from the explosion and early interactions with the circumstellar medium (CSM). Spectral analysis of these remnants can provide critical insights into supernova (SN) engine dynamics, the nature of progenitor stars, and the final stages of stellar evolution, including mass-loss mechanisms in the millennia leading up to the SN. This white paper evaluates the potential of the Line Emission Mapper (LEM), an advanced X-ray probe concept proposed in response to NASA 2023 APEX call, to deliver high-resolution spectra of SNRs. Such capabilities would allow detailed analysis of parent SNe and progenitor stars, currently beyond our possibilities. We employed a hydrodynamic model that simulates the evolution of a neutrino-driven SN from core-collapse to a 2000-year-old mature remnant. This model successfully replicates the large-scale properties of Cassiopeia A at an age of about 350 years. Using this model, we synthesized mock LEM spectra from different regions of the SNR, considering factors like line shifts and broadening due to plasma bulk motion and thermal ion motion, deviations from ionization and temperature equilibrium, and interstellar medium absorption. Analyzing these mock spectra with standard tools revealed LEM impressive capabilities. We demonstrated that fitting these spectra with plasma models accurately recovers the line-of-sight velocity of the ejecta, enabling 3D structure exploration of shocked ejecta, similar to optical methods. LEM also distinguishes between Doppler and thermal broadening of ion lines and measures ion temperatures near the limb of SNRs, providing insights into ion heating at shock fronts and cooling in post-shock flows. This study highlights LEM potential to advance our understanding of core-collapse SN dynamics and related processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the climate dynamics at the inner edge of the habitable zone (HZ) is crucial for predicting the habitability of rocky exoplanets. Previous studies using Global Climate Models (GCMs) have indicated that planets receiving high stellar flux can exhibit climate bifurcations, leading to bistability between a cold (temperate) and a hot (runaway) climate. However, the mechanism causing this bistability has not been fully explained, in part due to the difficulty associated with inferring mechanisms from small numbers of expensive numerical simulations in GCMs. In this study, we employ a two-column (dayside and nightside), two-layer climate model to investigate the physical mechanisms driving this bistability. Through mechanism-denial experiments, we demonstrate that the runaway greenhouse effect, coupled with a cloud feedback on either the dayside or nightside, leads to climate bistability. We also map out the parameters that control the location of the bifurcations and size of the bistability. This work identifies which mechanisms and GCM parameters control the stellar flux at which rocky planets are likely to retain a hot, thick atmosphere if they experience a hot start. This is critical for the prioritization of targets and interpretation of observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Furthermore, our modeling framework can be extended to planets with different condensable species and cloud types.
#### Very Extended Ionized Gas Discovered around NGC 1068 with the Circumgalactic H$\alpha$ Spectrograph

 - **Abstract**
 We have performed wide-field, ultra-low surface brightness H$\alpha$ emission line mapping around NGC 1068 with the newly commissioned Circumgalactic H$\alpha$ Spectrograph (\chas). NGC 1068 is notable for its active galactic nucleus, which globally ionizes gas in the disk and halo. Line-emitting diffuse ionized gas is distributed throughout the galactic disk and large-scale ionized filaments are found well beyond the disk, aligned with the cone angle of the central jet. We report the discovery of a new Ribbon of ionized gas around NGC 1068 beyond even the known outer filamentary structure, located 20 kpc from the galaxy. The H$\alpha$ surface brightness of this Ribbon is on the order of the bright Telluric lines, ranging from $[4-16]$ R with fainter regions on the order of the sky background continuum. Unlike previous extended emission, the Ribbon is not as well aligned with the current axis of the central jet. It is not associated with any galactic structure or known tidal features in the halo of NGC 1068, though it may originate from a larger distribution of unmapped neutral atomic or molecular gas in the halo. The morphology of the Ribbon emission in H$\alpha$ is correlated with extended UV emission around NGC 1068. H$\alpha$ to UV flux ratios in the Ribbon are comparable to extended emission line ratios in the halos of NGC 5128, NGC 253, and M82. The H$\alpha$ excess in the Ribbon gas suggests ionization by slow-shocks or a mixture of in-situ star formation and photoionization and collisional ionization processes.
