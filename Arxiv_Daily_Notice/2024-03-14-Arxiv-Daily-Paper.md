 - **Abstract**
 Photometric classifications of supernova (SN) light curves have become necessary to utilize the full potential of large samples of observations obtained from wide-field photometric surveys, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Here, we present a photometric classifier for SN light curves that does not rely on redshift information and still maintains comparable accuracy to redshift-dependent classifiers. Our new package, Superphot+, uses a parametric model to extract meaningful features from multiband SN light curves. We train a gradient-boosted machine with fit parameters from 6,061 ZTF SNe that pass data quality cuts and are spectroscopically classified as one of five classes: SN Ia, SN II, SN Ib/c, SN IIn, and SLSN-I. Without redshift information, our classifier yields a class-averaged F1-score of 0.61 +/- 0.02 and a total accuracy of 0.83 +/- 0.01. Including redshift information improves these metrics to 0.71 +/- 0.02 and 0.88 +/- 0.01, respectively. We assign new class probabilities to 3,558 ZTF transients that show SN-like characteristics (based on the ALeRCE Broker light curve and stamp classifiers), but lack spectroscopic classifications. Finally, we compare our predicted SN labels with those generated by the ALeRCE light curve classifier, finding that the two classifiers agree on photometric labels for 82 +/- 2% of light curves with spectroscopic labels and 72% of light curves without spectroscopic labels. Superphot+ is currently classifying ZTF SNe in real time via the ANTARES Broker, and is designed for simple adaptation to six-band Rubin light curves in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite being energetically important, the effect of cosmic rays on the dynamics of the interstellar medium (ISM) is assumed to be negligible because the cosmic ray energy diffusion coefficient parallel to the magnetic field is relatively large. Using numerical simulations, we explore how variation of the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient as a function of gas temperature could impact the dynamics of the ISM. We create a two-zone model of cosmic ray transport, reflecting the strong damping of the small scale magnetic field fluctuations, which scatter the cosmic rays, in a gas with low ionization. The variable diffusion coefficient allows more cold gas to form. However, setting the diffusion coefficient at a critical value in the warm phase allows the cosmic rays to adjust the kinetic energy cascade. Specifically, we show the slope of the cascade changes for motion perpendicular to the mean magnetic field, whereas kinetic energy parallel to the magnetic field is reduced equally across inertial scales. We show that cosmic ray energization (or reacceleration) comes at the expense of total radiated energy generated during the formation of a cold cloud. We also show that our two-zone model of cosmic ray transport is capable of matching estimates of the grammage for some paths through the simulation, but full comparison of the grammage requires simulating turbulence in a larger volume.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a comprehensive CO study toward the Monoceros OB1 (Mon OB1) region based on the MWISP survey at an angular resolution of about $50''$. The high-sensitivity data, together with the high dynamic range, shows that molecular gas in the $\rm 8^{\circ}\times4^{\circ}$ region displays complicated hierarchical structures and various morphology (e.g., filamentary, cavity-like, shell-like, and other irregular structures). Based on Gaussian decomposition and clustering for $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$ data, a total of 263 $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$ structures are identified in the whole region, and 88\% of raw data flux is recovered. The dense gas with relatively high column density from the integrated CO emission is mainly concentrated in the region where multiple $\rm ^{13}CO$ structures are overlapped. Combining the results of 32 large $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$ structures with distances from Gaia DR3, we estimate an average distance of $\rm 729^{+45}_{-45}~pc$ for the GMC complex. The total mass of the GMC Complex traced by $\mathrm{^{12}CO}$, $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$, and $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$ are $1.1\times10^5~M_\odot$, $4.3\times10^4~M_\odot$, and $8.4\times10^3~M_\odot$, respectively. The dense gas fraction shows a clear difference between Mon OB1 GMC East (12.4\%) and Mon OB1 GMC West (3.3\%). Our results show that the dense gas environment is closely linked to the nearby star-forming regions. On the other hand, star-forming activities have a great influence on the physical properties of the surrounding molecular gas (e.g., greater velocity dispersion, higher temperatures, and more complex velocity structures, etc.). We also discuss the distribution/kinematics of molecular gas associated with nearby star-forming activities.

 - **Abstract**
 Yellow supergiants (YSGs) are rare and poorly understood, and studying them is critical to constraining massive star evolution. We obtained flux-calibrated Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle (MIKE) high-resolution spectra of 40 YSGs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC); this sample likely contains post-red supergiants (RSGs). Fitting these data with ATLAS9 model atmospheres, we determined fundamental parameters for these stars. We measure the first spectroscopic luminosities for YSGs above 20 $M_\odot$, providing us a novel probe of the luminosity-to-mass ratio. Many stars in our sample appear to have anomalously high surface gravities, despite being confirmed LMC supergiants. We manually inspected our data finding evidence for binary companions and ongoing mass loss. Our work demonstrates the valuable role of high-resolution spectroscopy in interpreting the evolutionary status of cool supergiants.
#### Emergence of high-mass stars in complex fiber networks (EMERGE). I.  Early ALMA Survey: observations and massive data reduction

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) Recent molecular surveys have revealed a rich gas organization of sonic-like fibers in all kind of environments prior to the formation of low- and high-mass stars. This paper introduces the EMERGE project aiming to investigate whether complex fiber arrangements could explain the origin of high-mass stars and clusters. We analyzed the EMERGE Early ALMA Survey including 7 star-forming regions in Orion (OMC-1/2/3/4 South, L1641N, NGC2023, and Flame Nebula) homogeneously surveyed in both molecular lines (N$_2$H$^+$ J=1-0, HNC J=1-0, plus HC3N J=10-9) and 3mm-continuum using a combination of interferometric ALMA mosaics and IRAM-30m single-dish (SD) maps. Based on our low-resolution (SD) observations, we describe the global properties of our sample covering a wide range of physical conditions including low-, intermediate, and high-mass star-forming regions in different evolutionary stages. Their comparison with ancillary YSO catalogs denotes N$_2$H$^+$ as the best proxy for the dense, star-forming gas in our targets showing a constant star formation efficiency and a fast time evolution of <1 Myr. While apparently clumpy and filamentary in our SD data, all targets show a much more complex fibrous substructure at the enhanced resolution of our ALMA+IRAM-30m maps. A large number of filamentary features at sub-parsec scales are clearly recognized in the high-density gas traced by N$_2$H$^+$ directly connected to the formation of individual protostars. This complex gas organization appears to extend further into the more diffuse gas traced by HNC. This paper presents the EMERGE Early ALMA survey including a first data release of continuum maps and spectral products for this project to be analysed in future papers of this series. A first look at these results illustrates the need of advanced data combination techniques to investigate the intrinsic multi-scale, gas structure of the ISM.
#### VODKA-JWST: Synchronized growth of two SMBHs in a massive gas disk? A  3.8 kpc separation dual quasar at cosmic noon with JWST NIRSpec IFU

 - **Abstract**
 The search for dual supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is of immense interest in modern astrophysics. Galaxy mergers may be an important route to fuel and to produce SMBH pairs. Actively accreting SMBH pairs can be observed as a dual quasar, which are vital probes of SMBH growth. Gaia observations have enabled a novel technique to systematically search for such dual quasars at previously unreachable sub-kpc scales, based on the small jitters of the light centroid as the two quasars vary stochastically. Here we present the first detailed study of a 0.46'', 3.8 kpc separation, VODKA-selected dual quasar, J0749+2255, at $z=2.17$ using JWST/NIRSpec integral field unit spectroscopy. This is one of the most distant, small separation dual quasars identified today. Dual quasars at cosmic noon are not well characterized. We detect the faint ionized gas of the host galaxy, best traced by the narrow \ha\ emission. Line ratio diagnostics show a mix of ionization from the two quasars and intense star formation. The spatially-resolved spectra of the two quasars suggest that they have very similar black hole properties (two $M_{BH}\sim 10^9\ \textrm{M}_{\odot}$ with large Eddington ratio reaching $L/L_{Edd}\sim0.2$) hinting at the possible synchronized growth and accretion from the same gas supply. Surprisingly, the ionized gas kinematics suggest an extended, rotating disk rather than a disturbed system that would be expected in a major gas-rich galaxy merger. While it is unclear if J0749+2255 is representative of the dual quasar evolution, the observations with JWST revealed a major puzzle. It would be interesting to see what observations of other dual quasars will show.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently discovered inertial waves, observed on the solar surface, likely extend to the deeper layers of the Sun. Utilizing helioseismic techniques, we explore these motions, allowing us to discern inertial-mode eigenfunctions in both radial and latitudinal orientations. We analyze $8$ years of space-based observations ($2010 - 2017$) taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar dynamic observatory (SDO) using normal-mode coupling. Coupling between same and different-degree acoustic modes and different frequency bins are measured in order to capture the various length scales of inertial modes. We detect inertial modes at high latitude with azimuthal order $t=1$ and frequency $\sim -80$ nHz. This mode is present in the entire convection zone. The presence of Rossby modes may be seen down to a depth of $\sim 0.83R_\odot$ and the Rossby signal is indistinguishable from noise below that depth for high azimuthal order. We find that the amplitudes of these modes increase with depth down to around $0.92 R_\odot$ and decrease below that depth. We find that the latitudinal eigenfunctions of Rossby modes deviate from sectoral spherical harmonics if we use a similar approach as adopted in earlier studies. We found that spatial leakage and even pure noise in the measurements of non-sectoral components can also explain the above-mentioned characteristics of the latitudinal eigenfunctions. This realization underscores the necessity for careful interpretation when considering the latitudinal eigenfunctions of Rossby modes. Exploring the depth-dependent characteristics of these modes will enable us to capture interior dynamics distinctly, separate from p-mode seismology.

 - **Abstract**
 We present SN 2023zaw $-$ a sub-luminous ($\mathrm{M_r} = -16.7$ mag) and rapidly-evolving supernova ($\mathrm{t_{1/2,r}} = 4.9$ days), with the lowest nickel mass ($\approx0.002$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) measured among all stripped-envelope supernovae discovered to date. The photospheric spectra are dominated by broad He I and Ca NIR emission lines with velocities of $\sim10\ 000 - 12\ 000$ $\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. The late-time spectra show prominent narrow He I emission lines at $\sim$1000$\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, indicative of interaction with He-rich circumstellar material. SN 2023zaw is located in the spiral arm of a star-forming galaxy. We perform radiation-hydrodynamical and analytical modeling of the lightcurve by fitting with a combination of shock-cooling emission and nickel decay. The progenitor has a best-fit envelope mass of $\approx0.2$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and an envelope radius of $\approx50$ $\mathrm{R_\odot}$. The extremely low nickel mass and low ejecta mass ($\approx0.5$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) suggest an ultra-stripped SN, which originates from a mass-losing low mass He-star (ZAMS mass $<$ 10 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) in a close binary system. This is a channel to form double neutron star systems, whose merger is detectable with LIGO. SN 2023zaw underscores the existence of a previously undiscovered population of extremely low nickel mass ($< 0.005$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) stripped-envelope supernovae, which can be explored with deep and high-cadence transient surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 GW170817 represents the first observed binary neutron star merger event by humanity. The observation of GW170817 has identified the correlation between Kilonova, gravitational wave and short GRB. The shocks from GW170817 have the capacity to inject significant thermal and kinetic energies into the interstellar medium and evolve for over a million years. In this letter, we adopt the special relativity fluid dynamics equations to simulate the evolution of the GW170817 remnant over a span of one million years. Our simulations yield the evolution profiles of the velocity, density, mass, radius, luminosity, and energies of the remnant. We estimate that the GW170817 remnant will reach the average maximum luminosity $ 2.56\times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$at approximately $3.96\times 10^4$ yr. At the end of the cooling stage, the contaminated radius and mass are $48.35$ pc and $2.25\times 10^4 M_{\odot}$, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultraviolet (UV) processing in the insterstellar medium (ISM) induces the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Aliphatics, including alkanes, are present in different interstellar environments, being prevalently formed in evolved stars; thus, the dehydrogenation by UV photoprocessing of alkanes plays an important role in the chemistry of the ISM, leading to the formation of unsaturated hydrocarbons and eventually to aromatics, the latter ubiquitously detected in the ISM. Here, through combined experimental results and \textit{ab-initio} calculations, we show that UV absorption (mainly at the Ly-$\alpha$ emission line of hydrogen at 121.6 nm) promotes an alkane to an excited Rydberg state from where it evolves towards fragmentation inducing the formation of olefinic C=C bonds, which are necessary precursors of aromatic hydrocarbons. We show that photochemistry of aliphatics in the ISM does not primarily produce direct hydrogen elimination but preferential C-C photocleavage. Our results provide an efficient synthetic route for the formation of unsaturated aliphatics, including propene and dienes, and suggest that aromatics could be formed in dark clouds by a bottom-up mechanism involving molecular fragments produced by UV photoprocessing of aliphatics.
#### Metallicities for more than 10 million stars derived from Gaia BP/RP  spectra

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The third Gaia Data Release, which includes BP/RP spectra for 219 million sources, has opened a new window in the exploration of the chemical history and evolution of the Milky Way. The wealth of information encapsulated in these data is far greater than their low resolving power (R=50) at first glance would suggest, as shown in many studies. We zero in on the use of this data for the purpose of the detection of ''new'' metal-poor stars, which are hard to find yet essential for understanding - among other - several aspects of the origin of the Galaxy, star formation and the creation of the elements. Aims. We strive to refine a metal-poor candidate selection method which was developed with simulated Gaia BP/RP spectra, with an ultimate objective of providing the community with both a recipe to select stars for medium/high resolution observations and a catalogue of stellar metallicities. Methods. We used a datased comprised of GALAH DR3 and SAGA database stars in order to verify and adjust to real world data our selection method. For that purpose, we used dereddening as a mean to tackle the issue of extinction, and then we applied our fine-tuned method to select metal-poor candidates, which we thereafter observed and analysed. Results. We were able to infer metallicities for GALAH DR3 and SAGA stars - with color excesses up to E(B-V)<1.5 - with an uncertainty of 0.36 dex, which is good enough for the purpose of identifying new metal-poor stars. Further, we selected 26 metal-poor candidates - via our method - for observations. As spectral analysis showed, 100% of them had [Fe/H]<-2.0, 57% had [Fe/H]<-2.5 and 8% had [Fe/H]<-3.0. We inferred metallicities for these stars with an uncertainty of 0.31 dex, as was proven when comparing to the spectroscopic [Fe/H]. Finally, we assembled a catalogue of metallicities for 10 861 062 stars.
#### What Does the Large Magellanic Cloud Look Like? It Depends on [M/H] and  Age

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08516
 - **Abstract**
 We offer a new way to look at the Large Magellanic Cloud through stellar mono-abundance and mono-age-mono-abundance maps. These maps are based on $\gtrsim 500\,000$ member stars with photo-spectroscopic [M/H] and age estimates from Gaia DR3 data, and they are the first area-complete, metallicity- and age-differentiated stellar maps of any disk galaxy. Azimuthally averaged, these maps reveal a surprisingly simple picture of the Milky Way's largest satellite galaxy. For any [M/H] below -0.1 dex, the LMC's radial profile is well described by a simple exponential, but with a scale length that steadily shrinks towards higher metallicities, from nearly 2.3~kpc at [M/H]$=-1.8$ to only 0.75~kpc at [M/H]$=-0.25$. The prominence of the bar decreases dramatically with [M/H], making it barely discernible at [M/H]$\lesssim -1.5$. Yet, even for metal-rich populations, the bar has little impact on the azimuthally averaged profile of the mono-abundance components. Including ages, we find that the scale length is a greater function of age than of metallicity, with younger populations far more centrally concentrated. At old ages, the scale length decreases with increasing metallicity; at young ages, the scale-length is independent of metallicity. These findings provide quantitative support for a scenario where the LMC built its stellar structure effectively outside in.
#### Narrowly-Banded Spectra with Peak Frequency Around 1 GHz of FRB  20201124A: Implications for Energy Function and Radiation Physics

 - **Abstract**
 The radiation physics of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains an open question. Current observations have discovered that narrowly-banded bursts of FRB 20201124A are active in 0.4-2 GHz and their spectral peak frequency ($\nu^{\rm obs}_{p}$) are mostly toward $\sim 1$ GHz. Utilizing a sample of 1268 bursts of FRB 20201124A detected with the FAST telescope, we show that the $1\sigma$ spectral regime of 71.4\% events (in-band bursts) is within the FAST bandpass. Their intrinsic burst energies ($E^{\rm obs}_{\rm BWe}$) and spectral widths ($\sigma_s^{\rm obs}$) are well measured by fitting the spectral profile with a Gaussian function. The derived $E^{\rm obs}_{\rm BWe}$ and $\sigma_s^{\rm obs}$ distributions are log-normal and centering at $\log E^{\rm obs}_{\rm BWe}/{\rm erg}=37.2~ (\sigma=0.76)$ and $\log \sigma_s^{\rm obs}/{\rm GHz}=-1.16~ (\sigma=0.17)$. Our Monte Carlo simulation analysis infers its intrinsic $\nu_p$ distribution as a normal function centered at $\nu_{p,c}=1.16$ GHz ($\sigma=0.22$) and its intrinsic energy function as $\Phi(E)\propto E^{-0.60}e^{-E/E_c}$ with $E_c=9.49 \times 10^{37}$ erg. We compare these results with that of typical repeating FRBs 20121102A and 20190520B that are active over a broad frequency range at several specific frequencies and discuss possible observational biases on the estimation of the event rate and energy function. Based on these results, we argue that FRB 20201124A likely occurs in a fine-tuned plasma for maser radiations at a narrow frequency range, while FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B could involve clumpy plasma conditions that make maser emission around several specific frequencies in a broad range.
#### Limits on the OH Molecule in the Smith High Velocity Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 We have used the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to search for the OH molecule at several locations in the Smith Cloud, one of the most prominent of the high-velocity clouds that surround the Milky Way. Five positions with a high HI column density were selected as targets for individual pointings, along with a square degree around a molecular cloud detected with the Planck telescope near the tip of the Smith Cloud. Gas in the Galactic disk with similar values of $N_{HI}$ has detectable OH emission. Although we found OH at velocities consistent with the foreground Aquila molecular cloud, nothing was found at the velocity of the Smith Cloud to an rms level of 0.7 mK (T$_b$) in a 1 km $s^1$ channel. The three positions that give the strictest limits on OH are analyzed in detail. Their combined data imply a $5\sigma$ limit on $N(H_2) / N_{HI} \leq 0.03$ scaled by a factor dependent on the OH excitation temperature and background continuum $T_{ex}/(T_{ex}-T_{bg})$. There is no evidence for far-infrared emission from dust within the Smith Cloud. These results are consistent with expectations for a low-metallicity diffuse cloud exposed to the radiation field of the Galactic halo rather than a product of a galactic fountain.
