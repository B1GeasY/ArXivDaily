 An intensive reverberation mapping campaign on the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk817 using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) revealed significant variations in the response of the broad UV emission lines to fluctuations in the continuum emission. The response of the prominent UV emission lines changes over a $\sim$60-day duration, resulting in distinctly different time lags in the various segments of the light curve over the 14 months observing campaign. One-dimensional echo-mapping models fit these variations if a slowly varying background is included for each emission line. These variations are more evident in the CIV light curve, which is the line least affected by intrinsic absorption in Mrk817 and least blended with neighboring emission lines. We identify five temporal windows with distinct emission line response, and measure their corresponding time delays, which range from 2 to 13 days. These temporal windows are plausibly linked to changes in the UV and X-ray obscuration occurring during these same intervals. The shortest time lags occur during periods with diminishing obscuration, whereas the longest lags occur during periods with rising obscuration. We propose that the obscuring outflow shields the ultraviolet broad lines from the ionizing continuum. The resulting change in the spectral energy distribution of the ionizing continuum, as seen by clouds at a range of distances from the nucleus, is responsible for the changes in the line response.
#### A Nitrogen-rich SNR in M31: SNR Interaction with the CSM at Late Times

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of a supernova remnant (SNR) in M31 which is unlike any other remnant known in that galaxy. An optical MMT spectrum of WB92-26 sampling most of this marginally resolved object reveals strong lines of [O II], [Ne III], H I, [O III], [O I], [N II] and [S II], though the H I lines are very weak and the [N II] lines are very strong. Multiple velocity components are visible in those lines, with broad wings extending to $-2000$ and $+1500$ or $2000$ km/s (the heliocentric velocity of M31 is $-300$ km/s). The lines show strong peaks or shoulders near $-750$ km/s, $-50$ km/s, and $+800$ km/s in the M31 frame. The density implied by the [S II] ratio combined with the X-ray luminosity, FUV flux and optical size lead us to conclude that the optical emission lines are generated by shock waves, not photoionization. Consideration of the velocity structure indicates that the emission is from a shock in the circumstellar medium (CSM). This CSM must be depleted in H and enriched in He and N through CNO processing, and it must have had a high velocity before the explosion of the parent star, to explain the broad wings in the emission lines. We estimate the CSM shell to have a mass of 2 Msun, implying a Core Collapse SN. It is likely that Eta Car will produce a remnant resembling WB92-26 a few thousand years after it explodes.
#### Mode coupling coefficients between the convective core and radiative  envelope of $γ\,$Doradus and slowly pulsating B stars

 - **Abstract**
 Signatures of coupling between an inertial mode in the convective core and a gravito-inertial mode in the envelope have been found in four-year Kepler light curves of 16 rapidly rotating $\gamma\,$Doradus ($\gamma\,$Dor) stars. This makes it possible to obtain a measurement of the rotation frequency in their convective core. Despite their similar internal structure and available data, inertial modes have not yet been reported for slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars. We aim to provide a numerical counterpart of the recently published theoretical expressions for the mode-coupling coefficients, $\varepsilon$ and $\tilde{\varepsilon}$. These coefficients represent the two cases of a continuous and a discontinuous Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency profile at the core-envelope interface, respectively. We used asteroseismic forward models of two samples consisting of 26 SPB stars and 37 $\gamma\,$Dor stars to infer their numerical values of $\varepsilon$. The asteroseismically inferred values of $\varepsilon$ for the two samples are between 0.0 and 0.34. While $\varepsilon$ is most strongly correlated with the near-core rotation frequency for $\gamma\,$Dor stars, the fractional radius of the convective core instead provides the tightest correlation for SPB stars. We find $\varepsilon$ to decrease mildly as the stars evolve. Our asteroseismic results for the mode coupling support the theoretical interpretation and reveal that young, fast-rotating $\gamma\,$Dor stars are most suitable for undergoing couplings between inertial modes in the rotating convective core and gravito-inertial modes in the radiative envelope. The phenomenon has been found in 2.4\% of such pulsators with detected period spacing patterns, whereas it has not been seen in any of the SPB stars so far.

 - **Abstract**
 The explosion processes of supernovae (SNe) are imprinted in their explosion geometries. Here, we study the intrinsic polarization of 15 hydrogen-rich core-collapse SNe and explore the relation with the photometric and spectroscopic properties. Our sample shows diverse properties of the continuum polarization. The polarization of most SNe has a low degree at early phases but shows a sudden rise to $\sim 1$ \% degree at certain points during the photospheric phase as well as a slow decline during the tail phase, with a constant polarization angle. The variation in the timing of peak polarisation values implies diversity in the explosion geometry: some SNe have aspherical structures only in their helium cores, while in other SNe these reach out to a significant part of the outer hydrogen envelope with a common axis from the helium core to the hydrogen envelope. Other SNe show high polarization from early phases and a change of the polarization angle around the middle of the photospheric phase. This implies that the ejecta are significantly aspherical to the outermost layer and have multi-directional aspherical structures. Exceptionally, the Type~IIL SN~2017ahn shows low polarization at both the photospheric and tail phases. Our results show that the timing of the polarization rise in Type~IIP SNe is likely correlated with their brightness, velocity and the amount of radioactive Ni produced: brighter SNe with faster ejecta velocity and a larger $^{56}$Ni mass have more extended-aspherical explosion geometries. In particular, there is a clear correlation between the timing of the polarization rise and the explosion energy, that is, the explosion asphericity is proportional to the explosion energy. This implies that the development of a global aspherical structure, e.g., a jet, might be the key to realising an energetic SN in the mechanism of SN explosions.

 - **Abstract**
 We have used the IRAM 30-m telescope to map some targets with HCO$^+$ (1-0) and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ (1-0) lines in order to search for gas infall evidence in the clumps. In this paper, we report the mapping results for 13 targets. All of these targets show HCO$^+$ emissions, while H$^{13}$CO$^+$ emissions are observed in ten of them. The HCO$^+$ integrated intensity maps of ten targets show clear clumpy structures, and nine targets show clumpy structures in the H$^{13}$CO$^+$ maps. Using the RADEX radiative transfer code, we estimate the column density of H$^{13}$CO$^+$, and determine the abundance ratio [H$^{13}$CO$^+$]/[H$_2$] to be approximately 10$^{-12}$ to 10$^{-10}$. Based on the asymmetry of the HCO$^+$ line profiles, we identify 11 targets show blue profiles, while six clumps have global infall evidence. We use the RATRAN and two-layer models to fit the HCO$^+$ line profiles of these infall sources, and analyze their spatial distribution of the infall velocity. The average infall velocities estimated by these two models are 0.24 -- 1.85 km s$^{-1}$ and 0.28 -- 1.45 km s$^{-1}$, respectively. The mass infall rate ranges from approximately 10$^{-5}$ to 10$^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, which suggests that intermediate- or high-mass stars may be forming in the target regions.
#### Searching for high-energy neutrinos from shock-interaction powered  supernovae with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory

 - **Abstract**
 The sources of the astrophysical neutrino flux discovered by IceCube are for the most part unresolved. Extragalactic core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) have been suggested as candidate multi-messenger sources. In interaction-powered supernovae, a shock propagates in a dense circumstellar medium (CSM), producing a bright optical emission and potentially accelerating particles to relativistic energies. Shock interaction is believed to be the main energy source for Type IIn supernovae (identified by narrow lines in the spectrum), hydrogen-rich superluminous supernovae and a subset of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae. Production of high-energy neutrinos is expected in collisions between the accelerated protons in the shocks and the cold CSM particles. We select a catalog of interaction-powered supernovae from the Bright Transient Survey of the Zwicky Transient Facility. We exploit a novel modeling effort that connects the time evolution of the optical emission to the properties of the ejecta and the CSM, allowing us to set predictions of the neutrino flux for each source. In this contribution, we describe a stacking search for high-energy neutrinos from this population of CCSNe with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.
#### Search for Galactic core-collapse supernovae in a decade of data taken  with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has been continuously taking data to search for O(0.5-10) s long neutrino bursts since 2007. Even if a Galactic core-collapse supernova is optically obscured or collapses to a black hole instead of exploding, it will be detectable via the O(10) MeV neutrino burst emitted during the collapse. We discuss a search for such events covering the time between April 17, 2008 and December 31, 2019. Considering the average data taking and analysis uptime of 91.7% after all selection cuts, this is equivalent to 10.735 years of continuous data taking. In order to test the most conservative neutrino production scenario, the selection cuts were optimized for a model based on a 8.8 solar mass progenitor collapsing to an O-Ne-Mg core. Conservative assumptions on the effects of neutrino oscillations in the exploding star were made. The final selection cut was set to ensure that the probability to detect such a supernova within the Milky Way exceeds 99%. No such neutrino burst was found in the data after performing a blind analysis. Hence, a 90% C.L. upper limit on the rate of core-collapse supernovae out to distances of ~ 25kpc was determined to be 0.23/yr. For the more distant Magellanic Clouds, only high neutrino luminosity supernovae will be detectable by IceCube, unless external information on the burst time is available. We determined a model-independent limit by parameterizing the dependence on the neutrino luminosity and the energy spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution 3D maps of interstellar dust are critical for probing the underlying physics shaping the structure of the interstellar medium, and for foreground correction of astrophysical observations affected by dust. We aim to construct a new 3D map of the spatial distribution of interstellar dust extinction out to a distance of 1.25 kpc from the Sun. We leverage distance and extinction estimates to 54 million nearby stars derived from the Gaia BP/RP spectra. Using the stellar distance and extinction information, we infer the spatial distribution of dust extinction. We model the logarithmic dust extinction with a Gaussian Process in a spherical coordinate system via Iterative Charted Refinement and a correlation kernel inferred in previous work. We probe our 661 million dimensional posterior distribution using the variational inference method MGVI. Our 3D dust map achieves an angular resolution of 14' (Nside = 256). We sample the dust extinction in 516 distance bins spanning 69 pc to 1250 pc. We obtain a maximum distance resolution of 0.4 pc at 69 pc and a minimum distance resolution of 7 pc at 1.25 kpc. Our map resolves the internal structure of hundreds of molecular clouds in the solar neighborhood and will be broadly useful for studies of star formation, Galactic structure, and young stellar populations. It is available for download in a variety of coordinate systems at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8187943 and can also be queried via the publicly available dustmaps Python package.
