 - **Abstract**
 Due to high-cadence automated surveys, we can now detect and classify supernovae (SNe) within a few days after explosion, if not earlier. Early-time spectra of young SNe directly probe the outermost layers of the ejecta, providing insights into the extent of stripping in the progenitor star and the explosion mechanism in the case of core-collapse supernovae. However, many SNe show overlapping observational characteristics at early time, complicating the early-time classification. In this paper, we focus on the study and classification of Type Ib supernovae (SNe Ib), which are a subclass of core-collapse supernovae that lack strong hydrogen lines but show helium lines in their spectra. Here we present a spectral dataset of 8 SNe Ib, chosen to have at least 3 pre-maximum spectra, which we call early spectra. Our dataset was obtained mainly by the the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) and consists of a total of 82 optical photospheric spectra, including 38 early spectra. This data set increases the number of published SNe Ib with at least three early spectra by ~60%. For our classification efforts, we use early spectra in addition to spectra taken around maximum light. We also convert our spectra into SN Identification (SNID) templates and make them available to the community for easier identification of young SNe Ib. Our data set increases the number of publicly available SNID templates of early spectra of SNe Ib by ~43%. Almost half of our sample has SN types that change over time or are different from what is listed on the Transient Name Server (TNS). We discuss the implications of our dataset and our findings for current and upcoming SN surveys and their classification efforts.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: HR2562B is a planetary-mass companion located 0.56arcsec (19au) from its host star. It is one of a few L/T transitional objects orbiting a young star. This companion provides insight into the evolution of young objects in the L/T transition. However, its key physical properties, such as Teff and mass, remain poorly constrained, with large uncertainties (34% for Teff, 22% for log(g)) based on near-infrared observations alone. Aims: We aim to refine these uncertainties, especially for Teff (1200-1700K) and log(g) (4-5), using new MIR data from the JWST/MIRI filters (10.65, 11.40, and 15.50 microns), and better understand the companion's chemical composition and its role in the L/T transition. Methods: MIRI data were processed using reference star differential imaging, revealing HR2562B at high S/N (16) in all 3 filters. We used 2 atmospheric models, ATMO and ExoREM, to fit the SED, combining MIR and NIR datasets. Additionally, we used CMD with brown dwarfs to explore the chemical composition of HR2562B's atmosphere and compare it to another L/T transition object, VHS1256b. Results: Our analysis improved the temperature precision (Teff=1255+-15K) by 6x compared to previous estimates. We also narrowed its luminosity to -4.69+-0.01 dex. Surface gravity remains uncertain (4.4-4.8), and its mass is estimated between 8 and 18.5Mj, depending on modeling and astrometry. Sensitivity analysis revealed the ability to detect objects between 2-5Mj at 100au. Conclusions: HR2562B likely has a near cloud-free atmosphere, with the ATMO model fitting better than ExoREM. Silicate absorption features are weak, requiring further spectroscopic observations. While HR2562B and VHS1256b share similarities, they are in different evolutionary stages, making HR2562B key to understanding young objects in the L/T transition. It is likely a planetary-mass companion, suggesting a reclassification as HR2562b.

 - **Abstract**
 Our understanding of the assembly timeline of the Milky Way has been transforming along with the dramatic increase in astrometric and spectroscopic data available over the past several years. Many substructures in chemo-dynamical space have been discovered and identified as the remnants of various galactic mergers. To investigate the timeline of these mergers we select main sequence turn off & subgiant stars (MSTOs) from the H3 survey, finding members in seven metal poor components of the halo: GSE, the Helmi Streams, Thamnos, Sequoia, Wukong/LMS-1, Arjuna, and I'itoi. We also select out the metal poor in situ disk to facilitate comparison to the evolution of the Milky Way itself at these early epochs. We fit individual isochrone ages to the MSTOs in each of these substructures and use the resulting age distributions to infer simple star formation histories. For GSE we resolve an extended star formation history that truncates $\approx10$ Gyr ago, as well as a clear age -- metallicity relation. From this age distribution and measured star formation history we infer that GSE merged with the Milky Way at a time $9.5-10.2$ Gyr ago, in agreement with previous estimates. We infer that the other mergers occurred at various times ranging from $9-13$ Gyr ago, and that the metal poor component of the disk built up within only a few billion years. These results reinforce the emerging picture that both the disk and halo of the Milky Way experienced a rapid assembly.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence (CS) in the globular cluster (GC) Omega Centauri, the primary goal of a dedicated Hubble Space Telescope (HST) programme. Our analysis has revealed that the peak at the termination of the WD CS is located at $m_{\rm F606W}$=30.1$\pm$0.2 (equivalent to $V$$\sim$31). The brighter part of Omega Centauri's WD CS is consistent with the presence of massive He-core WDs, in agreement with previous HST analyses with ultraviolet and blue filters. Comparative analyses of the WD luminosity function (LF) with theoretical counterparts have shown that a single-age population for the cluster is compatible with the data. However, an analysis of just the WD LF cannot entirely exclude the possibility of an age range, due to uncertainties in the present-day WD mass function, with a star formation history potentially spanning up to 5 billion years, predominantly comprising stars about 13 Gyr old, and with just a minority potentially as young as 8 Gyr. This underscores the need for global spectroscopic and photometric investigations that include simultaneously the WD populations together with the previous evolutionary phases to fully understand the cluster's diverse chemical compositions and ages.
#### Solar energetic particles injected inside and outside a magnetic cloud: The widespread solar energetic particle event on 2022 January 20

 - **Abstract**
 Context. On 2022 January 20, the Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) on board Solar Orbiter measured a solar energetic particle (SEP) event showing unusual first arriving particles from the anti-Sun direction. Near-Earth spacecraft separated 17° in longitude to the west from Solar Orbiter measured classic antisunward-directed fluxes. STEREO-A and MAVEN, separated 18° to the east and 143° to the west from Solar Orbiter respectively, also observed the event, suggesting that particles spread over at least 160° in the heliosphere. Results. Solar Orbiter was embedded in a MC erupting on 16 January from the same active region as the one related to the SEP event on 20 January. The SEP event is related to a M5.5 flare and a fast CME-driven shock of 1433 km/s, which injected particles within and outside the MC. The hard SEP spectra, the presence of a Type II radio burst, and the co-temporal Type III radio bursts being observed from 80 MHz that seems to emanate from the Type II, points to the shock as the relevant accelerator of the particles. Conclusions. The detailed analysis of the SEP event strongly suggest that the energetic particles are injected mainly by a CME-driven shock into and outside of a previous MC present in the heliosphere at the time of the particle onset. The sunward propagating SEPs measured by Solar Orbiter are produced by the injection of particles along the longer (western) leg of the MC still connected to the Sun at the time of the release of the particles. The determined electron propagation path length inside the MC is around 30% longer than the estimated length of the loop leg of the MC itself (based on the graduated cylindrical shell model) consistent with a low number of field line rotations.
#### Post-Outburst Chemistry in a Very Low-Luminosity Object: Peculiar High Abundance of Nitric Oxide

 - **Abstract**
 Abridged: Very Low Luminosity Objects (VeLLOs) are deeply embedded, and extremely faint objects and are thought to be in the quiescent phase of the episodic accretion process. They fill an important gap in our understanding of star formation. The VeLLO in the isolated DC3272+18 cloud has undergone an outburst, and is thus an ideal target for investigating the chemical inventory in the gas phase of an object of its type. Observations with the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) in four spectral windows in the frequency range of 213.6--272.4~GHz have been carried out to identify molecules that can be directly linked to the past outburst, utilize the line fluxes, column densities, and the abundance ratios of the detected species to characterize the different physical components of the VeLLO, and probe for the presence of complex organic molecules. Nitric oxide (NO) is detected for the first time in a source of this type, and its formation could be induced by the sublimation of grain-surface species during the outburst. A pathway to form NO directly in the gas phase is from the photodissociation products created after the sublimation of H$_2$O and NH$_3$ from the ices. While the present time water snowline has likely retreated to pre-outburst small radius, the volatile NO species is still extensively present in the gas phase, as evident by its high column density relative to methanol in the observations. This suggests that NO could be potentially used to trace the water snowline in outbursting sources. In order to rule out non-thermal desorption processes that could also have led to the formation of NO, this proposition has to be verified with future observations at higher spatial resolution, and by searching for NO in additional targets.

 - **Abstract**
 A successful theory of star formation should predict the number of objects as a function of their mass produced through star-forming events. Previous studies in star-forming regions and the solar neighborhood identify a mass function increasing from the hydrogen-burning limit down to about 10 M$_{J}$. Theory predicts a limit to the fragmentation process, providing a natural turnover in the mass function down to the opacity limit of turbulent fragmentation thought to be 2-10 M$_{J}$. Programs to date have not been sensitive enough to probe the hypothesized opacity limit of fragmentation. Here we present the first identification of a turnover in the initial mass function below 12 M$_{J}$ within NGC 2024, a young star-forming region. With JWST/NIRCam deep exposures across 0.7-5 {\mu}m, we identified several free floating objects down to ~ 3 M$_{J}$ with sensitivity to 0.5 M$_{J}$. We present evidence for a double power law model increasing from about 60 M$_{J}$ to roughly 12 M$_{J}$, consistent with previous studies, followed by a decrease down to 0.5 M$_{J}$. Our results support the predictions of star and brown dwarf formation theory, identifying the theoretical turnover in the mass function and suggest the fundamental limit of turbulent fragmentation near 3 M$_{J}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are laboratories for stellar evolution, strong gravity, and ultra-dense matter. Although MSPs are thought to originate in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), approximately 27% lack a binary companion, while others are found in systems with large orbital eccentricities. Understanding how these systems form may provide insight into the internal properties of neutron stars (NSs). We study the formation of a twin compact star through rapid first-order phase transitions in NS cores due to mass accretion in LMXBs. We investigate whether this mechanism, possibly coupled with secondary kick effects such as neutrino or electromagnetic rocket effects, may leave an observable long-lasting imprint on the orbit. We simulate mass accretion in LMXBs consisting of a NS and a low-mass main sequence companion, following the evolution of the NS mass, radius, and spin until a strong phase transition is triggered. For the NS structure, we assume a multipolytrope equation-of-state that allows for a sharp phase transition from hadronic to quark matter and satisfies observational constraints. We find that in compact binaries with relatively short pre-Roche lobe overflow orbital periods, an accretion-induced phase transition may occur during the LMXB phase. In contrast, in systems with wider orbits, this transition may take place during the spin-down phase, forming an eccentric binary MSP. If the transition is accompanied by a secondary kick (w > 20 km/s), the binary is likely to be disrupted, forming an isolated MSP or reconfigured to an ultra-wide orbit. Our results suggest that accretion in LMXBs provides a viable path for forming twin compact stars, potentially leaving an observable imprint on the orbit. The eccentricity distribution of binary MSPs with long (> 50 d) orbital periods could provide constraints on first-order phase transitions in dense nuclear matter.
#### Multi-epoch UV $-$ X-ray spectral study of NGC 4151 with AstroSat

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-wavelength spectral study of NGC 4151 based on five epochs of simultaneous AstroSat observations in the near ultra-violet (NUV) to hard X-ray band ($\sim 0.005-80$ keV) during $2017 - 2018$. We derived the intrinsic accretion disk continuum after correcting for internal and Galactic extinction, contributions from broad and narrow line regions, and emission from the host galaxy. We found a bluer continuum at brighter UV flux possibly due to variations in the accretion disk continuum or the UV reddening. We estimated the intrinsic reddening, $E(B-V) \sim 0.4$, using high-resolution HST/STIS spectrum acquired in March 2000. We used thermal Comptonization, neutral and ionized absorption, and X-ray reflection to model the X-ray spectra. We obtained the X-ray absorbing neutral column varying between $N_H \sim 1.2-3.4 \times 10^{23} cm^{-2}$, which are $\sim 100$ times larger than that estimated from UV extinction, assuming the Galactic dust-to-gas ratio. To reconcile this discrepancy, we propose two plausible configurations of the obscurer: (a) a two-zone obscurer consisting of dust-free and dusty regions, divided by the sublimation radius, or (b) a two-phase obscurer consisting of clumpy, dense clouds embedded in a low-density medium, resulting in a scenario where a few dense clouds obscure the compact X-ray source substantially, while the bulk of UV emission arising from the extended accretion disk passes through the low-density medium. Furthermore, we find a positive correlation between X-ray absorption column and $NUV-FUV$ color and UV flux, indicative of enhanced winds possibly driven by the 'bluer-when-brighter' UV continuum.

 - **Abstract**
 We have used the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the CTIO Blanco 4-m telescope to perform a new emission-line survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using narrow-band H-alpha and [SII] filters in addition to a continuum band for use in creating pure emission-line images. We refer to this new survey as DeMCELS, to distinguish it from the earlier Magellanic Cloud Emission Line Survey (MCELS) that has been in service for nearly 25 years. DeMCELS covers $\sim 54$ degrees$^{2}$, encompassing most of the bright optical disk of the LMC. With DECam's pixel size of only 0.27", our DeMCELS survey provides a seeing-limited improvement of 3-5 times over MCELS and is comparable in depth, with surface brightness limits of 3.3E-17 erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ in H-alpha and 2.9E-17 erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ in H-alpha and [SII], respectively. DeMCELS provides detailed morphological information on nebulae of all scales, from the largest supershells to individual [HII] regions and supernova remnants, to bubbles of emission surrounding individual stars, and even to faint structures in the diffuse ionized gas of the LMC. Many complex regions of emission show significant variations in the ratio of [SII] to H-alpha, a sign of the mixture of shocks from stellar winds and/or supernovae with photoionization by embedded hot, young stars. We present the details of the observing strategy and data processing for this survey, and show selected results in comparison with previous data. A companion project for the Small Magellanic Cloud is in progress and will be reported separately. We are making these new data available to the community at large via the NOIRLab's Data Lab site.

 - **Abstract**
 Many compact objects (black holes and neutron stars) exist in binaries. These binaries are normally discovered through their interactions, either from accretion as an X-ray binary or collisions as a gravitational wave source. However, the majority of compact objects in binaries should be non-interacting. Recently proposed discoveries have used radial velocities of a bright star (main sequence or evolved) that are indicative of a massive but dark companion, which is inferred to be a compact object. Unfortunately, this burgeoning new field has been hindered by false positives, including the ``Unicorn'' (V723 Mon) which was initially believed to be a red giant/black hole binary before being refuted. In this work, we investigate the evolution of stellar binary populations over time, using the binary evolution code COSMIC to simulate binary populations and determine the probability of a candidate object being either a ``true Unicorn'' (actual compact objects in binaries) or a false positive. We find that main sequence stars have a higher true Unicorn probability than red giants or naked helium stars (an exposed core of an evolved star), particularly if the companion is more massive and is >3 times less luminous than the MS star. We also find that a top-heavy initial mass function raises the true Unicorn probability further, that super-solar metallicity reduces the probability, and that most true Unicorns are found at periods <100 days. Finally, we find that a significant fraction of true Unicorns do not evolve into x-ray binaries during the age of the universe.

 - **Abstract**
 The petaling effect, induced by pupil fragmentation from the telescope spider, drastically affects the performance of high contrast instruments by inducing core splitting on the PSF. Differential piston/tip/tilt aberrations within each optically separated fragment of the pupil are poorly measured by commonly used Adaptive Optics (AO) systems. We here pursue a design of dedicated low-order wavefront sensor -- or petalometers -- to complement the main AO. Interferometric devices sense differential aberrations between fragments with optimal sensitivity; their weakness though is their limitation to wrapped phase measurements. We show that by combining multiple spectral channels, we increase the capture range for petaling aberrations beyond several microns, enough to disambiguate one-wave wrapping errors made by the main AO system. We propose here to implement a petalometer from the multi-wavelength imaging mode of the VAMPIRES visible-light instrument, deployed on SCExAO at the Subaru Telescope. The interferometric measurements obtained in four spectral channels through a 7 hole non-redundant mask allow us to effiiently reconstruct diffierential piston between pupil petals.

 - **Abstract**
 Filaments are believed to play a key role in high-mass star formation. We present a systematic study of the filaments and their hosting clumps in the G35 molecular complex using JCMT SCUBA-2 850 $\micron$ continuum data. We identified five clouds in the complex and 91 filaments within them, some of which form 10 hub-filament systems (HFSs), each with at least 3 hub-composing filaments. We also compiled a catalogue of 350 dense clumps, 183 of which are associated with the filaments. We investigated the physical properties of the filaments and clumps, such as mass, density, and size, and their relation to star formation. We find that the global mass-length trend of the filaments is consistent with a turbulent origin, while the hub-composing filaments of high line masses ($m_{\rm l}\,>$\,230\,$\mathrm{M_{\odot}~pc^{-1}}$) in HFSs deviate from this relation, possibly due to feedback from massive star formation. We also find that the most massive and densest clumps (R\,$>$\,0.2\,pc, M\,$>35\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, $\mathrm{\Sigma}>\,0.05\,\mathrm{g~cm^{-2}}$) are located in the filaments and in the hubs of HFS with the latter bearing a higher probability of occurrence of high-mass star-forming signatures, highlighting the preferential sites of HFSs for high-mass star formation. We do not find significant variation in the clump mass surface density across different evolutionary environments of the clouds, which may reflect the balance between mass accretion and stellar feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of the Fe K line emission at $\sim6.62^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$ keV with a width of $\sim0.19^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ keV using two epochs of {\it Chandra} archival data from the nucleus of the galaxy 4C+37.11, which is known to host a binary supermassive black hole (BSMBH) system where the SMBHs are separated by $\sim7$ mas or $\sim$ 7pc. Our study reports the first detection of the Fe K line from a known binary AGN, and has an F-statistic value of 20.98 and probability $2.47\times 10^{-12}$. Stacking of two spectra reveals another Fe K line component at $\sim7.87^{+0.19}_{-0.09}$ keV. Different model scenarios indicate that the lines originate from the combined effects of accretion disk emission and circumnuclear collisionally ionized medium. The observed low column density favors the gas-poor merger scenario, where the high temperature of the hot ionized medium may be associated with the shocked gas in the binary merger and not with star formation activity. The estimated total BSMBH mass and disk inclination are $\sim1.5\times10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ and $\gtrsim75^\circ$, indicating that the BSMBH is probably a high inclination system. The spin parameter could not be tightly constrained from the present data sets. Our results draw attention to the fact that detecting the Fe K line emissions from BSMBHs is important for estimating the individual SMBH masses, and the spins of the binary SMBHs, as well as exploring their emission regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence plays a critical role in many key astrophysical processes such as star formation, acceleration of cosmic rays, and heat conduction. However, its properties are still poorly understood. We explore how to extract the intermittency of compressible MHD turbulence from the synthetic and real observations. The three statistical methods, namely the probability distribution function, kurtosis, and scaling exponent of the multi-order structure function, are used to reveal the intermittency of MHD turbulence. Our numerical results demonstrate that: (1) the synchrotron polarization intensity statistics can be used to probe the intermittency of magnetic turbulence, by which we can distinguish different turbulence regimes; (2) the intermittency of MHD turbulence is dominated by the slow mode in the sub-Alfv{é}nic turbulence regime; (3) the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) at the low latitude region corresponds to the sub-Alfvénic and supersonic turbulence regime. We have successfully measured the intermittency of the Galactic ISM from the synthetic and realistic observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Inferring spectral parameters from X-ray data is one of the cornerstones of high-energy astrophysics, and is achieved using software stacks that have been developed over the last twenty years and more. However, as models get more complex and spectra reach higher resolutions, these established software solutions become more feature-heavy, difficult to maintain and less efficient. Aims. We present jaxspec, a Python package for performing this task quickly and robustly in a fully Bayesian framework. Based on the JAX ecosystem, jaxspec allows the generation of differentiable likelihood functions compilable on core or graphical process units (resp. CPU and GPU), enabling the use of robust algorithms for Bayesian inference. Methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of jaxspec samplers, in particular the No U-Turn Sampler, using a composite model and comparing what we obtain with the existing frameworks. We also demonstrate its ability to process high-resolution spectroscopy data and using original methods, by reproducing the results of the Hitomi collaboration on the Perseus cluster, while solving the inference problem using variational inference on a GPU. Results. We obtain identical results when compared to other softwares and approaches, meaning that jaxspec provides reliable results while being $\sim 10$ times faster than existing alternatives. In addition, we show that variational inference can produce convincing results even on high-resolution data in less than 10 minutes on a GPU. Conclusions. With this package, we aim to pursue the goal of opening up X-ray spectroscopy to the existing ecosystem of machine learning and Bayesian inference, enabling researchers to apply new methods to solve increasingly complex problems in the best possible way. Our long-term ambition is the scientific exploitation of the data from the newAthena X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU).

 - **Abstract**
 The binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) model proposes long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate in binaries composed of a carbon-oxygen (CO) star and a neutron star (NS) companion. The CO core collapse generates a newborn NS and a supernova that triggers the GRB by accreting onto the NSs, rapidly transferring mass and angular momentum to them. We perform three-dimensional, smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics simulations of BdHNe using up-to-date NS nuclear equations of state (EOS), with and without hyperons, and calculate the structure evolution in full general relativity. We assess the binary parameters leading either NS to the critical mass for gravitational collapse into a black hole (BH) and its occurrence time, $t_\textrm{col}$. We include a non-zero angular momentum of the NSs and find that $t_\textrm{col}$ ranges from a few tens of seconds to hours for decreasing NS initial angular momentum values. BdHNe I are the most compact (about five minutes orbital period), promptly form a BH and release $\gtrsim 10^{52}$ erg. They form NS-BH binaries with tens of kyr merger timescale by gravitational-wave emission. BdHNe II and III do not form BHs, release $\sim 10^{50}$-$10^{52}$ erg and $\lesssim 10^{50}$ erg. They form NS-NS with a wider range of merger timescales. In some compact BdHNe II, either NS can become supramassive, i.e., above the critical mass of a non-rotating NS. Magnetic braking by a $10^{13}$ G field can delay BH formation, leading to BH-BH or NS-BH of tens of kyr merger timescale.

 - **Abstract**
 Comet C/2017 K2 (Pan-STARRS) provided a rare opportunity to investigate the evolution of coma composition and outgassing patterns over a transitional heliocentric distance (Rh) range where activity drivers in comets are thought to change from "hypervolatile" (CO, CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, and/or CO$_2$)-dominated to H2O-dominated. We performed high-resolution, cross-dispersed, near-infrared spectroscopy of C/2017 K2 with iSHELL at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) and NIRSPEC at the W. M. Keck 2 Observatory. We report gas rotational temperatures (Trot) and molecular production rates (Q; mol/s) or upper limits for the hypervolatile species CH$_4$, CO, and C$_2$H$_6$, together with less volatile ices (CH$_3$OH, H$_2$O, HCN, C$_2$H$_2$, NH$_3$, and OCS) over a range of pre-perihelion distances, Rh= 3.15 - 2.35 au. We also report (or stringently constrain) abundance ratios (mixing ratios) of the targeted species with respect to CO, C$_2$H$_6$, and (when detected) H$_2$O. All volatiles were enriched relative to water in C/2017 K2 when compared to their mean values among Oort Cloud comets, whereas abundances relative to C2H6 were consistent with their average values from other long-period comets.

 - **Abstract**
 The radial distribution of gas within galactic haloes is connected to the star formation rate and the nature of baryon-driven feedback processes. Using six variants of the hydrodynamic simulation Simba, we study the impact of different stellar/AGN feedback prescriptions on the gas density profiles of haloes in the total mass range $10^{11} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot} < M_{\mathrm{200c}} < 10^{14} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and redshift interval $0<z<4$. We find that the radial profiles are well represented by a power law and that, for a fixed total halo mass, the slope and amplitude of such power law are generally weakly dependent on redshift. Once AGN-driven jets are activated in the simulation, the gas density profile of haloes with $M_{\rm 200c} \gtrsim 10^{13} \, \rm M_{\odot}$ declines more gently with radial distance. We argue that this distinctive feature could be exploited with current observations to discriminate amongst the predictions of the different feedback models. We introduce a universal fitting formula for the slope and amplitude of the gas density profile as a function of total halo mass and redshift. The best-fit functions are suitable for all feedback variants considered, and their predictions are in excellent agreement with the numerical results. We provide the values of all fit parameters, making our fitting formula a versatile tool to mimic the effect of Simba feedback models onto N-body simulations and semi-analytical models of galaxy formation. Our results can also aid observational estimates of the gas mass within haloes that assume a specific slope for the underlying gas density profile.
