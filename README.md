#### Circumnuclear Multi-phase Gas in the Circinus Galaxy. VI. Detectability  of Molecular Inflow and Atomic Outflow

 - **Abstract**
 Recent submillimeter observations have revealed signs of pc-scale molecular inflow and atomic outflow in the nearest Seyfert 2 galaxy, the Circinus galaxy. To verify the gas kinematics suggested by these observations, we performed molecular and atomic line transfer calculations based on a physics-based 3D radiation-hydrodynamic model, which has been compared with multi-wavelength observations in this paper series. The major axis position-velocity diagram (PVD) of CO(3-2) reproduces the observed faint emission at the systemic velocity, and our calculations confirm that this component originates from failed winds falling back to the disk plane. The minor-axis PVD of [CI]($^3P_1$-$^3P_0$), when created using only the gas with positive radial velocities, presents a sign of blue- and redshifted offset peaks similar to those in the observation, suggesting that the observed peaks indeed originate from the outflow, but that the model may lack outflows as strong as those in the Circinus galaxy. Similar to the observed HCN(3-2), the similar dense gas tracer HCO$^+$(3-2) can exhibit nuclear spectra with inverse P-Cygni profiles with $\sim$0.5 pc beams, but the line shape is azimuthally dependent. The corresponding continuum absorbers are inflowing clumps at 5-10 pc from the center. To detect significant absorption with a high probability, the inclination must be fairly edge-on ($\gtrsim$85$^\circ$), and the beam size must be small ($\lesssim$1 pc). These results suggest that HCN or HCO$^+$ and [CI] lines are effective for observing pc-scale inflows and outflows, respectively.
#### FROST-CLUSTERS -- I. Hierarchical star cluster assembly boosts  intermediate-mass black hole formation

 - **Abstract**
 Observations and high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations indicate that massive star clusters assemble hierarchically from sub-clusters with a universal power-law cluster mass function. We study the consequences of such assembly for the formation of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) at low metallicities ($Z=0.01\;Z_\mathrm{\odot}$) with our updated N-body code BIFROST based on the hierarchical fourth-order forward integrator. BIFROST integrates few-body systems using secular and regularized techniques including post-Newtonian equations of motion up to order PN3.5 and gravitational-wave recoil kicks for BHs. Single stellar evolution is treated using the fast population synthesis code SEVN. We evolve three cluster assembly regions with $N_\mathrm{tot} = 1.70$--$2.35 \times 10^6$ stars following a realistic IMF in $\sim$1000 sub-clusters for $t=50$ Myr. IMBHs with masses up to $m_\bullet \sim 2200\:M_\mathrm{\odot}$ form rapidly mainly via the collapse of very massive stars (VMSs) assembled through repeated collisions of massive stars followed by growth through tidal disruption events and BH mergers. No IMBHs originate from the stars in the initially most massive clusters. We explain this by suppression of hard massive star binary formation at high velocity dispersions and the competition between core collapse and massive star life-times. Later the IMBHs form subsystems resulting in gravitational-wave BH-BH, IMBH-BH and IMBH-IMBH mergers with a $m_\bullet\sim1000\:M_\mathrm{\odot}$ gravitational-wave detection being the observable prediction. Our simulations indicate that the hierarchical formation of massive star clusters in metal poor environments naturally results in formation of potential seeds for supermassive black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of our mosaic observations of a single Class 0 protostar IRAS 15398$-$3359 with Atacama Compact Array (ACA) in the CO $J=2\mbox{-}1$ line. The new observations covering a $\sim\!2'$ square region revealed elongated redshifted and blueshifted components, which are located at distances of $\sim\!30''\mbox{-}75''$ on the northern and southern sides of the protostar, respectively, in addition to the previously observed primary and secondary outflows. These elongated components exhibit Hubble-law like velocity structures, i.e., an increase of velocity with increasing distance from the protostar, suggesting that it is the third outflow associated with the protostar. Besides, a new redshifted component is detected at radii of $\sim\!40''\mbox{-}75''$ on the northwestern side of the protostar. This redshifted component also exhibits a Hubble-law like velocity profile, which could be the counterpart of the secondary outflow mostly detected at blueshifted velocities in a previous study. The three outflows are all misaligned by $\sim\!20\mbox{-}90^\circ$, and the dynamical timescale of the primary outflow is shorter than those of the other outflows approximately by an order of magnitude. These facts hint that the outflow launch direction has significantly changed with time. The outflow direction may change if the rotational axis and the magnetic field are misaligned, or if the dense core is turbulent. We favor the second scenario as the origin of the multiple outflows in IRAS 15398$-$3359 based on a comparison between the observational results and numerical simulations.
#### $Herschel$ investigation of cores and filamentary structures in L1251  located in the Cepheus flare

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Molecular clouds are the prime locations of star formation. These clouds contain filamentary structures and cores which are crucial in the formation of young stars. Aims: In this work, we aim to quantify the physical properties of structural characteristics within the molecular cloud L1251 to better understand the initial conditions for star formation. Methods: We applied the getsf algorithm to identify cores and filaments within the molecular cloud L1251 using the Herschel multiband dust continuum image, enabling us to measure their respective physical properties. Additionally, we utilized an enhanced differential term algorithm to produce high-resolution temperature maps and column density maps with a resolution of ${13.5}''$. Results: We identified 122 cores in the region. Out of them, 23 are protostellar cores, 13 are robust prestellar cores, 32 are candidate prestellar cores (including 13 robust prestellar cores and 19 strictly candidate prestellar cores), and 67 are unbound starless cores. getsf also found 147 filament structures in the region. Statistical analysis of the physical properties (mass (M), temperature (T), size, and core brightness (hereafter, we are using the word luminosity (L)) for the core brightness) of obtained cores shows a negative correlation between core mass and temperature and a positive correlation between (M/L) and (M/T). Analysis of the filaments gives a median width of 0.14 pc and no correlation between width and length. Out of those 122 cores, 92 are present in filaments (75.4%) and the remaining were outside them. Out of the cores present in filaments, 57 (62%) cores are present in supercritical filaments ($M_{\rm line}>16M_{\odot }/{\rm pc}$).

 - **Abstract**
 From a careful visual scrutiny of the radio structures of a well-defined sample of 2428 sources in the LoTSS DR2 survey made at 144 MHz with a 6" beam, we have selected a subset of 25 (i.e., 1%) sources showing highly unusual radio structures, not conforming to the prevalent radio morphological classification. Here we present and briefly discuss the basic properties of these rare morphological outliers and attempt to dissect their morphological peculiarities, based on multi-wavelength radio images and radio-optical overlays. Also, we underscore the need to accord due importance to such anomalous radio sources, considering the challenge they pose to the standard theoretical models and simulations of extragalactic double radio sources.
#### Resolving the Mechanical and Radiative Feedback in J1044+0353 with KCWI  Spectral Mapping

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11390
 - **Abstract**
 We present integral field spectroscopy toward and around J1044+0353, a rapidly growing, low-metallicity galaxy which produces extreme [O III] line emission. A new map of the O32 flux ratio reveals a density-bounded ionization cone emerging from the starburst. The interaction of the hydrogen ionizing radiation, produced by the very young starburst, with a cavity previously carved out by a galactic outflow, whose apex lies well outside the starburst region, determines the pathway for global Lyman continuum (LyC) escape. In the region within a few hundred parsecs of the young starburst, we demonstrate that superbubble breakthrough and blowout contribute distinct components to the [O III] line profile, broad and very-broad emission line wings, respectively. We draw attention to the large [O III] luminosity of the broad component and argue that this emission comes from photoionized, superbubble shells rather than a galactic wind as is often assumed. The spatially resolved H eII 4686 nebula appears to be photoionized by young star clusters. Stellar wind emission from these stars is likely the source of line wings detected on the He II line profile. This broader He II component indicates slow stellar winds, consistent with an increase in stellar rotation (and a decrease in effective escape speed) at the metallicity of J1044+0353. At least in J1044+0353, the recent star formation history plays a critical role in generating a global pathway for LyC escape, and the anisotropic escape would likely be missed by direct observations of the LyC.

 - **Abstract**
 Post-asymptotic giant branch stars (post-AGB) in binary systems, with typical orbital periods between ~100 to ~1000 days, result from a poorly understood interaction that terminates their precursory AGB phase. The majority of these binaries display a photospheric anomaly called 'chemical depletion', thought to arise from an interaction between the circumbinary disc and the post-AGB star, leading to the reaccretion of pure gas onto the star, devoid of refractory elements due to dust formation. In this paper, we focus on a subset of chemically peculiar binary post-AGBs in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) whose high-resolution optical spectroscopic study revealed a carbon and s-process enrichment, contrary to the commonly observed photospheric chemical depletion. Using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting and period-luminosity-colour (PLC) relation methods, we determine the luminosity of the targets ($2700-8300L_{\odot}$), which enables confirmation of their evolutionary phase and estimation of initial masses (as a function of metallicity) ($1-2.5M_{\odot}$). In conjunction with predictions from dedicated ATON stellar evolutionary models, our results indicate a predominant intrinsic enrichment of carbon and s-process elements in our binary post-AGB targets. We qualitatively rule out extrinsic enrichment and inherited s-process enrichment from the host galaxy as plausible explanations for the observed overabundances. Our chemically peculiar subset of intrinsic carbon and s-process enriched binary post-AGBs also hints at potential variation in the efficiency of chemical depletion between stars with C-rich and O-rich circumbinary disc chemistries. However, critical observational studies of circumbinary disc chemistry are necessary to address gaps in our current understanding of disc-binary interactions inducing chemical depletion in binary post-AGB systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The Mg II resonance doublet at 2796 {\AA} and 2803 {\AA} is an increasingly important tool to study cold, $T \sim 10^{4}\,$K, gas -- an observational driven development requiring theoretical support. We develop a new Monte Carlo radiative transfer code to systematically study the joined Mg II and Ly$\alpha$ escape through homogeneous and `clumpy' multiphase gas with dust in arbitrary 3D geometries. Our main findings are: (i) The Mg II spectrum differs from Ly$\alpha$ due to the large difference in column densities, even though the atomic physics of the two lines are similar. (ii) the Mg II escape fraction is generally higher than that of Ly$\alpha$ because of lower dust optical depths and path lengths -- but large variations due to differences in dust models and the clumpiness of the cold medium exist. (iii) Clumpy media possess a `critical covering factor' above which Mg II radiative transfer matches a homogeneous medium. The critical covering factors for Mg II and Ly$\alpha$ differ, allowing constraints on the cold gas structure. (iv) The Mg II doublet ratio $R_{\rm MgII}$ varies for strong outflows/inflows ($\gtrsim 700 \mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$), in particular, $R_{\rm MgII}<1$ being an unambiguous tracer for powerful galactic winds. (v) Scattering of stellar continuum photons can decrease $R_{\rm MgII}$ from two to one, allowing constraints on the scattering medium. Notably, we introduce a novel probe of the cold gas column density -- the halo doublet ratio -- which we show to be a powerful indicator of ionizing photon escape. We discuss our results in the context of interpreting and modeling observations as well as their implications for other resonant doublets.

 - **Abstract**
 It is believed that the core of a neutron star can be host to various novel phases of matter, from nucleon superfluid phase to exotic high baryon density QCD phases. Different observational signals for such phase transitions have been discussed in the literature. Here, we point out a unique phenomenon associated with phase transition to a superfluid phase, which may be the nucleon superfluid phase or a phase like the CFL phase, allowing for superfluid vortices. In any superfluid phase transition, a random network of vortices forms via the so-called Kibble-Zurek mechanism, which eventually mostly decays away, finally leaving primarily vortices arising from the initial angular momentum of the core. This transient, random vortex network can have a non-zero net angular momentum for the superfluid component, which will generally be oriented in an arbitrary direction. This is in contrast to the final vortices, which arise from initial rotation and hence have the initial angular momentum of the neutron star. The angular momentum of the random vortex network is balanced by an equal and opposite angular momentum in the normal fluid due to the conservation of angular momentum, thereby imparting an arbitrarily oriented angular momentum component to the outer shell of the neutron star. This will affect the pulse timing and pulse profile of a pulsar. These changes in the pulses will decay away in a characteristic manner as the random vortex network decays, obeying specific scaling laws leading to universal features for the detection of superfluid transitions occurring in a pulsar core.

 - **Abstract**
 Atomic Hydrogen-21 cm transition (HI) is an excellent tracer to study and understand the properties of the atomic gas in the Galaxy. Using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT), we observed 12 quasar sightlines to detect galactic HI in absorption. We achieve an optical depth RMS of $\sim 1-2 \times 10^{-3}$, essential to detect the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM). We detect HI absorption in all our sightlines except along 1006+349, for which we set a strict upper limit on the spin temperature as $\langle T_s \rangle > 570$ K. We find around 50\% of our sightlines have $\langle T_s \rangle > 500$ K, indicating a WNM dominance. Further, we calculate an upper limit of the CNM fraction along our sightlines and find a median CNM fraction of $\sim 0.12$. With our observations, we reconfirm the existence of a threshold column density of $\sim 2 \times 10^{20} \ cm^{-2}$ to form CNM in the ISM. Using a two-temperature model of the HI disk, we explore the distribution of spin temperature in the Galactic ISM. We find that a simple fixed axisymmetric two-temperature model could not produce either the observed column density or the integral optical depth. This indicates the existence of a more complex distribution of spin temperatures in the Galaxy.
#### The fuzzy cores of Jupiter and Saturn

 - **Abstract**
 New interior models of Jupiter and Saturn suggest that both planets have "fuzzy cores". These cores should be viewed as central regions that are enriched with heavy elements but are not distinct from the rest of the deep interior. These cores may contain large amounts of hydrogen and helium though small pure-heavy element cores may also exist. New measurements along with advanced planetary modeling have revolutionized the way we think about the interiors of giant planets and provide important constraints for planet formation and evolution theories. These developments are also relevant for the characterization of giant exoplanets.
#### ARTEMIS emulator: exploring the effect of cosmology and galaxy formation  physics on Milky Way-mass haloes and their satellites

 - **Abstract**
 We present the new ARTEMIS emulator suite of high resolution (baryon mass of $2.23 \times 10^{4}$ $h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$) zoom-in simulations of Milky Way mass systems. Here, three haloes from the original ARTEMIS sample have been rerun multiple times, systematically varying parameters for the stellar feedback model, the density threshold for star formation, the reionisation redshift and the assumed warm dark matter (WDM) particle mass (assuming a thermal relic). From these simulations emulators are trained for a wide range of statistics that allow for fast predictions at combinations of parameters not originally sampled, running in $\sim 1$ms (a factor of $\sim 10^{11}$ faster than the simulations). In this paper we explore the dependence of the central haloes' stellar mass on the varied parameters, finding the stellar feedback parameters to be the most important. When constraining the parameters to match the present-day stellar mass halo mass relation inferred from abundance matching we find that there is a strong degeneracy in the stellar feedback parameters, corresponding to a freedom in formation time of the stellar component for a fixed halo assembly history. We additionally explore the dependence of the satellite stellar mass function, where it is found that variations in stellar feedback, the reionisation redshift and the WDM mass all have a significant effect. The presented emulators are a powerful tool which allows for fundamentally new ways of analysing and interpreting cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. Crucially, allowing their free (subgrid) parameters to be varied and marginalised, leading to more robust constraints and predictions.
#### Typing supernova remnant G352.7$-$0.1 using XMM-Newton X-ray  observations

 - **Abstract**
 G352.7$-$0.1 is a mixed-morphology (MM) supernova remnant (SNR) with multiple radio arcs and has a disputed supernova origin. We conducted a spatially resolved spectroscopic study of the remnant with XMM-Newton X-ray data to investigate its explosion mechanism and explain its morphology. The global X-ray spectra of the SNR can be adequately reproduced using a metal-rich thermal plasma model with a temperature of $\sim 2$ keV and ionization timescale of $\sim 3\times 10^{10}~{\rm cm^{-3}~s}$. Through a comparison with various supernova nucleosynthesis models, we found that observed metal properties from Mg to Fe can be better described using core-collapse supernova models, while thermonuclear models fail to explain the observed high Mg/Si ratio. The best-fit supernova model suggests a $\sim 13$ $M_\odot$ progenitor star, consistent with previous estimates using the wind bubble size. We also discussed the possible mechanisms that may lead to SNR G352.7$-$0.1 being an MMSNR. By dividing the SNR into several regions, we found that the temperature and abundance do not significantly vary with regions, except for a decreased temperature and abundance in a region interacting with molecular clouds. The brightest X-ray emission of the SNR spatially matches with the inner radio structure, suggesting that the centrally filled X-ray morphology results from a projection effect.
#### Elastic and breaking properties of epitaxial face-centered crystals in  neutron star crusts and white dwarf cores

 - **Abstract**
 Crystallization of dense matter in neutron star crusts and white dwarf cores may be similar to epitaxial crystal growth in terrestrial laboratories. However in stellar crystals, the spacing between horizontal planes has to gradually increase with the outward movement of the crystallization front, tracing decrease of the electron density. This process produces Coulomb crystals with stretched rather than cubic elementary cells. We extend the analysis of the elastic and breaking properties of such crystals to the face-centered (fc) lattice. Shear deformations orthogonal to the stretch direction have been studied for 22 crystallographic shear planes. A common property for all these planes is a reduction and eventual nulling of the breaking shear strain with deviation from the unstretched configuration. The effective shear moduli for deformations orthogonal to the stretch direction have been calculated. It is possible that the epitaxial crystallization in compact stars results in a formation of large-scale crystallites or, at least, in growth of the whole crystallization front perpendicular to particular crystallographic planes. For fc structure growth orthogonal to the $\{111\}$ planes, we expect that, at any density, $\sim 5\%$ ($\sim 0.5\%$) of crystallite height is occupied by layers one (two) orders of magnitude weaker than the bulk of the crystallite. This may be important for realistic modeling of crustquakes on neutron stars.
#### Abundance stratification in type Ia supernovae -- VII. The peculiar,  C-rich iPTF16abc: highlighting diversity among luminous events

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe\,Ia) reveal diversity, even within assumed subcategories. Here, the composition of the peculiar iPTF16abc (SN\,2016bln) is derived by modeling a time series of optical spectra. iPTF16abc's early spectra combine traits of SNe 1999aa and 1991T known for weak \SiII\ $\lambda$ 6355 and prominent \FeIII\ features. However, it differs with weak early \FeIII\ lines, and persistent \CII\ lines post-peak. It also exhibits a weak \CaII\ H\&K feature aligning it with SN\,1991T, an observation supported by their bolometric light curves. The early attenuation of \FeIII\ results from abundance effect. The weakening of the \SiII\ $\lambda$ 6355 line, stems from silicon depletion in the outer shells, a characteristic shared by both SNe 1999aa and 1991T, indicating a common explosion mechanism that terminates nuclear burning at around 12000 \kms\, unseen in normal events. Beneath a thin layer of intermediate mass elements (IMEs) with a total mass of 0.18 \Msun, extends a \Nifs\ rich shell totaling 0.76 \Msun\ and generating a bolometric luminosity as high as ${L_{\mathrm{peak}}}=1.60 \pm 0.1 \times$ $10^{43}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. Inner layers, typical of SNe\,Ia, hold neutron-rich elements, (\Feff\ and \Nife), totaling 0.20 M${\odot}$. Stable iron, exceeding solar abundance, and carbon, coexist in the outermost layers, challenging existing explosion models. The presence of carbon down to $v\approx$ 9000\,\kms, totalling $\sim$ 0.01 \Msun\, unprecedented in this class, links iPTF16abc to SN\,2003fg-like events. The retention of 91T-like traits in iPTF16abc underscores its importance in understanding the diversity of SNe\,Ia.
