#### The Host Galaxy of a Dormant, Overmassive Black Hole at $z=6.7$ May Be  Restarting Star Formation

 - **Abstract**
 JWST is discovering a large population of $z>4$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that are overmassive with respect to the stellar content of their hosts. A previous study developed a physical model to interpret this overmassive population as the result of quasar feedback acting on a compact host galaxy. In this Note, we apply this model to JADES GN 1146115, a dormant supermassive black hole at $z=6.7$ whose mass is $\sim40\%$ of the host's mass in stars and accreting at $\sim2\%$ of the Eddington limit. The host has been forming stars at the low rate of $\sim 1 \, \rm M_\odot \,yr^{-1}$ for the past $\sim 100$ Myr. Our model suggests that this galactic system is on the verge of a resurgence of global star formation activity. This transition comes after a period of domination by the effect of its overmassive black hole, whose duration is comparable to typical quasar lifetimes.

 - **Abstract**
 Rapid formation of supermassive black holes occurs in dense nuclear star clusters that are initially gas-dominated. Stellar-mass black hole remnants of the most massive cluster sink into the core, where a massive runaway black hole forms as a consequence of combined effects of repeated mergers and Eddington-limited gas accretion. The associated gravitational-wave signals of high-redshift extreme mass-ratio inspirals are a unique signature of the nuclear star cluster scenario.
#### Kinematic and metallicity of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Andromeda XVIII

 - **Abstract**
 Andromeda XVIII is an isolated dwarf galaxy 579 kpc away from the nearest large galaxy, M31. It is a candidate ``backsplash galaxy'' that might have been affected by a close passage to M31. We present new Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy of Andromeda XVIII to assess the likelihood that it is a backsplash galaxy. We estimated the velocities, metallicities ([Fe/H]), and $\alpha$-enhancements ([$\alpha$/Fe]) for 56 probable members. We estimated Andromeda XVIII's mean heliocentric velocity, rotation velocity, position angle of the rotation axis, and velocity dispersion using maximum likelihood coupled with a Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC). There is no evidence for bulk rotation, though sub-populations might be rotating. The mean heliocentric velocity is -337.2 km s$^{-1}$. The line-of-sight velocity relative to M31 is -36 km s$^{-1}$ (approaching), which is lower than the escape velocity from M31. Based on the abundances of 38 stars with low errors ($\delta [Fe/H] < 0.3$) compared to a total of 56 probable members, parameters for the simplest chemical evolution models were estimated using maximum likelihood coupled with an MCMC. The metallicity distribution is inconsistent with these models due to a sharp metal-rich cut-off. Together, the metallicity distribution and the mean velocity are consistent with a sudden interruption of star formation. One possible cause for this quenching may be rapid gas loss due to ram pressure stripping during a close passage by M31 in the past. We also consider a past major merger as another possible cause.
#### Gravitational waves from nonradial oscillations of stochastically  accreting neutron stars

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11866
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11866
 - **Abstract**
 Oscillating neutron stars are sources of continuous gravitational waves. We study analytically the excitation of stellar oscillations by the mechanical impact on the stellar surface of ''clumps'' of stochastically accreted matter. We calculate the waveform and spectrum of the gravitational wave signal emitted by the accretion-driven pulsations. Results are generated for an idealised model of a nonrotating, unmagnetised, one-component star with uniform polytropic index $n_{\rm poly}$ assuming Newtonian gravity and the Cowling approximation. We find that the excited mode amplitudes grow with increasing $n_{\rm poly}$ and mode order $n$. The gravitational wave signal forms a sequence of amplitude-modulated packets for $n_{\rm poly}=1$, lasting $\sim 10^{-3}$s after each impact. The gravitational wave strain increases with increasing $n_{\rm poly}$, but decreases with increasing $n$ and increasing multipole order $l$ for $n_{\rm poly}=1$. In the observing band of current long-baseline interferometers, $g$-modes emit higher, narrower peaks in the amplitude spectral density than $f$- and $p$-modes, with the highest peaks reaching $\sim 10^{-26}$Hz$^{-1/2}$ for modes with damping time $\tau_{nl} \sim 10^{8}$yr. The root-mean-square strain $h_{\text{rms}}$, calculated by summing over modes with $2\leq l\leq4$ and $\tau_{nl} \leq 10^{8}$yr, spans the range $10^{-33} \leq h_{\text{rms}} \leq 10^{-32}$ for $1\leq n_{\text{poly}}\leq 2$.
#### Dark supernova remnant buried in the Galactic-Centre "Brick"  G0.253+0.016 revealed by an expanding CO-line bubble

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11892
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11892
 - **Abstract**
 We performed a $^{12}$CO- and $^{13}$CO($J=1-0$)-line study of the "Brick" (G0.253+0.016) in the Galactic Centre (GC) by analyzing the archival data obtained with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. We present kinematics and molecular gas distributions in the longitude-velocity diagrams, and suggest that the Brick is located along the GC Arm I in the central molecular zone (CMZ) in front of the GC, which yields a distance of 8 kpc and GC radius 0.2 kpc. The major and minor-axis diameters of the Brick are $D_x\times D_y=8.4 \ {\rm pc} \times 4.1 \ {\rm pc}$, and the scale radius is $r_{\rm bri}=\sqrt{D_x D_y}=2.96$ pc. The molecular mass inferred from the CO-line integrated intensity is $M_{\rm brixco} \sim 5.1\times 10^4 M_\odot$ for a conversion factor $X_{\rm gc}=1.0\times 10^{20}$ H$_2$ cm$^{-2}$ [K km s$^{-1}$]$^{-1}$, while the Virial mass for the velocity dispersion of $\sigma_v=10.0 $ km s $^{-1}$ is calculated to be $M_{\rm brivir}\sim 6.8 \times 10^4 \ M_\odot$, which yields a new conversion factor of $X_{\rm bri} =1.3\times 10^{20}$ H$_2$ cm$^{-2}$ [K km s$^{-1}$]$^{-1}$. No thermal radio emission indicative of HII region and star formation is found in radio-continuum archive. The Brick's center has a cavity surrounded by a spherical molecular bubble of radius $r_{\rm bub}=1.85$ pc and mass $\sim 1.7\times 10^4 M_\odot$ expanding at $v_{\rm exp}=10$ km s$^{-1}$ with kinetic energy of $E_0\sim 1.7\times 10^{49}$ erg. If the bubble is approximated by an adiabatic spherical shock wave, its age is $t\sim 2/5 r_{\rm bub}/v_{\rm exp}\sim 7.2\times 10^4$ y. We suggest that the bubble will be a dark supernova remnant buried in the dense molecular cloud. The Brick, therefore, experienced massive-star formation followed by a supernova explosion more than $\sim 10^5$ y ago.
#### Comparing the three-dimensional morphological asymmetries in the ejecta  of Kepler and Tycho in X-rays

 - **Abstract**
 Recent simulations have shown that asymmetries in the ejecta distribution of supernova remnants (SNRs) may be a reflection of asymmetries left over from the initial supernova explosion. Thus, SNR studies provide a vital means for testing and constraining model predictions in relation to the distribution of heavy elements, which are key to improving our understanding of the explosion mechanisms in Type Ia supernovae. The use of a novel blind source separation method applied to the megasecond X-ray observations of the historic Kepler and Tycho supernova remnants has revealed maps of the ejecta distribution. These maps are endowed with an unprecedented level of detail and clear separations from the continuum emission. Our method also provides a three-dimensional (3D) view of the ejecta by individually disentangling red- and blueshifted spectral components associated with images of the Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe emission. This approach provides insights into the morphology of the ejecta distribution in those two remnants. Those mappings have allowed us to thoroughly investigate the asymmetries in the intermediate-mass elements and Fe distribution in two Type Ia supernova remnants. We also compared the results with the core-collapse Cassiopeia A remnant, which we had studied previously. The images obtained confirm, as expected for Type Ia SNRs, that the Fe distribution is mostly closer to the core than that of intermediate-mass elements. They also highlight peculiar features in the ejecta distribution, such as the Fe-rich southeastern knot in Tycho.
#### Detection and prebiotic chemistry of possible glycine precursor molecule  methylenimine towards the hot molecular core G10.47+0.03

 - **Abstract**
 Amino acids are essential for the synthesis of protein. Amino acids contain both amine (R$-$NH$_{2}$) and carboxylic acid (R$-$COOH) functional groups, which help to understand the possible formation mechanism of life in the universe. Among the 20 types of amino acids, glycine (NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH) is known as the simplest non-essential amino acid. In the last 40 years, all surveys of NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH in the interstellar medium, especially in the star-formation regions, have failed at the millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths. We aimed to identify the possible precursors of NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH, because it is highly challenging to identify NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH in the interstellar medium. Many laboratory experiments have suggested that methylenimine (CH$_{2}$NH) plays a key role as a possible precursor of NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH in the star-formation regions via the Strecker synthesis reaction. After spectral analysis using the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model, we successfully identified the rotational emission lines of CH$_{2}$NH towards the hot molecular core G10.47+0.03 using the Atacama Compact Array (ACA). The estimated column density of CH$_{2}$NH towards G10.47+0.03 is (3.40$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ with a rotational temperature of 218.70$\pm$20 K, which is estimated from the rotational diagram. The fractional abundance of CH$_{2}$NH with respect to H$_{2}$ towards G10.47+0.03 is 2.61$\times$10$^{-8}$. We found that the derived abundance of CH$_{2}$NH agree fairly well with the existing two-phase warm-up chemical modelling abundance value of CH$_{2}$NH. We discuss the possible formation pathways of CH$_{2}$NH within the context of hot molecular cores, and we find that CH$_{2}$NH is likely mainly formed via neutral-neutral gas-phase reactions of CH$_{3}$ and NH radicals towards G10.47+0.03.
#### A Photoionization model for the Infrared Coronal Line Emission in the  Classical Nova V1716 Scorpii

 - **Abstract**
 A near-infrared spectrum of nova V1716 Scorpii (PNV J17224490-4137160), a recent bright (V_max = 7.3 mag), Fermi-LAT detected gamma-ray source, was modeled using the photoionization code CLOUDY. Abundances were estimated for He, C, N, O, Si, Al, Mg, Fe, Ne, S, Ca, and P. Notably, P (a factor of 120) and N (a factor of 248) are highly overabundant. It was necessary to assume the ejecta consist of two components (with a cylindrical geometry): a dense component from which the bulk of the H, He, and neutral O~I and N emission arises and a more diffuse component from which most of the coronal lines arise. Some of the coronal lines are found to originate from both the dense and diffuse components. The mass of the ejecta, including neutral and ionized gas, is ~ 4.19e-4 solar masses. Our analysis indicates that in the case of V1716 Sco (which has a carbon-oxygen white dwarf), a fraction of 25% white dwarf matter rather than 50% is favored for the mixing between white dwarf and the accreted envelope before the outburst. This mixing ratio is like that found for Oxygen-Neon novae where a 25% mixing fraction is also indicated. Helium hydride -- the first molecule to form after the Big Bang -- may have formed in the ejecta of V1716 Sco based on photoionization modeling. This prediction suggests that novae may be potential formation sites of this important molecular ion.
#### CRIRES$^+$ transmission spectroscopy of WASP-127b. Detection of the  resolved signatures of a supersonic equatorial jet and cool poles in a hot  planet

 - **Abstract**
 General circulation models of gas giant exoplanets predict equatorial jets that drive inhomogeneities across the planetary atmosphere. We studied the transmission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-127b during one transit in the K band with CRIRES+. Telluric and stellar signals were removed from the data using SYSREM and the planetary signal was investigated using the cross-correlation (CCF) technique. After detecting a spectral signal indicative of atmospheric inhomogeneities, we employed a Bayesian retrieval framework with a 2D modelling approach tailored to address this scenario. We detected strong signals of H$_2$O and CO, which exhibited not one but two distinct CCF peaks. The double peaked signal can be explained by a supersonic equatorial jet and muted signals at the poles, with the two peaks representing the signals from the planet's morning and evening terminators, respectively. We calculated an equatorial jet velocity of $7.7\pm0.2$km/s from our retrieved overall equatorial velocity and the planet's tidally locked rotation, and derive distinct atmospheric properties for the two terminators as well as the polar region. The evening terminator is found to be hotter than the morning terminator by $175^{+116}_{-133}$K and the muted signals from the poles can be explained by significantly lower temperatures or a high cloud deck. Our retrieval yields a solar C/O ratio and metallicity and challenges previous studies of WASP-127b's atmosphere. The presence of a double peaked signal highlights the importance of accounting for planetary 3D structure during interpretation of atmospheric signals. The measured supersonic jet velocity and the lack of signal from the polar regions, representing a detection of latitudinal inhomogeneity in a spatially unresolved target, showcases the power of high-resolution transmission spectroscopy for the characterization of global circulation in exoplanets.
