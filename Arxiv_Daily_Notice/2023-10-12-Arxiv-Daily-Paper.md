 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST/MIRI/MRS observations of an infrared luminous disk galaxy, FLS1, at z=0.54. With a lookback time of 5 Gyr, FLS1 is chronologically at the midpoint between the peak epoch of star formation and the present day. The MRS data provide maps of the atomic fine structure lines [Ar II]6.99 micron, [Ar III]8.99 micron, [Ne II]12.81 micron, and [Ne III]15.55 micron, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features at 3.3 micron, 6.2 micron, and 11.3 micron, and the warm molecular gas indicators H2S(5) and H2S(3); all these emission features are spatially resolved. We find that the PAH emission is more extended along the Northern side of the galaxy when compared to the well-studied star-formation tracer [Ne II]. The H2 rotational lines, which are shock indicators, are strongest and most extended on the Southern side of the galaxy. [Ar II] is the second brightest fine structure line detected in FLS1 and we show that it is a useful kinematic probe which can be detected with JWST out to z=3. Velocity maps of [Ar II] show a rotating disk with signs of turbulence. Our results provide an example of how spatially resolved mid-infrared spectroscopy can allow us to better understand the star formation and ISM conditions in a galaxy halfway back to the peak epoch of galaxy evolution.
#### A Cacophony of Echoes from daily monitoring of the Crab Pulsar at  Jodrell Bank

 - **Abstract**
 Using archival data from the 42 foot telescope at the Jodrell Bank Observatory, we produce daily stacks of aligned giant pulses for the Crab pulsar, to study changes to the daily profiles between April 2012 to December 2016. From these, we identify echoes, where intervening material away from the line of sight causes pulsed emission to be redirected towards the observer, with delay corresponding to the increased distance of travel, resulting in additional profile components. These observations show that such echoes may be far more common than implied by the previous rate of detections. All the observed echoes are consistent with approaching zero-delay at their closest approach to the normal giant pulse emission. This indicates that the structures responsible for producing these events must be highly anisotropic, with typical lengths greater than $\sim 4\textrm{AU}$, typical widths on the sky of $\sim 0.1 \textrm{AU}$ and typical depths of $\sim 5\textrm{AU}$, given the previously observed electron densities of the nebular filaments, on the order of 1000 cm$^{-3}$. This suggests that these inhomogeneities are likely to be offshoot substructure from the larger nebular filaments of the Crab nebula.

 - **Abstract**
 High-velocity stellar collisions driven by a supermassive black hole (BH) or BH-driven disruptive collisions, in dense, nuclear clusters can rival the energetics of supergiant star explosions following gravitational collapse of their iron core. Here, starting from a sample of red-giant star collisions simulated with the hydrodynamics code AREPO, we generate photometric and spectroscopic observables using the nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium time-dependent radiative transfer code CMFGEN. Collisions from more extended giants or stronger collisions (higher velocity or smaller impact parameter) yield bolometric luminosities on the order of 1e43 erg/s at 1d, evolving on a timescale of a week to a bright plateau at ~1e41 erg/s, before plunging precipitously after 20-40d at the end of the optically-thick phase. This luminosity falls primarily in the UV in the first days, thus when it is at its maximum, and shifts to the optical thereafter. Collisions at lower velocity or from less extended stars produce ejecta that are fainter but may remain optically thick for up to 40d if they have a small expansion rate. These collision debris show a similar spectral evolution as that observed or modeled for blue-supergiant star explosions of massive stars, differing only in the more rapid transition to the nebular phase. Such BH-driven disruptive collisions should be detectable by high-cadence surveys in the UV like ULTRASAT.

 - **Abstract**
 The application of silicon monoxide (SiO) as a shock tracer arises from its propensity to occur in the gas phase as a result of shock-induced phenomena, including outflow activity and interactions between molecular clouds and expanding HII regions or supernova remnants. We searched for indications of shocks toward 366 massive star-forming regions by observing the ground rotational transition of SiO ($v=0$, $J=1-0$) at 43 GHz with the Korean VLBI Network (KVN) 21 m telescopes to extend our understanding on the origins of SiO in star-forming regions. We detected SiO emission toward 104 regions that consist of 57 IRDCs, 21 HMPOs, and 26 UCHIIs. The determined median SiO column density, $N$(SiO), and abundance, $X$(SiO), relative to $N$(H$_2$) are $8.12\times10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $1.28\times10^{-10}$, respectively. These values are similar to those obtained toward other star-forming regions and also consistent with predicted values from shock models with low-velocity shocks ($\lesssim$10 - 15 km s$^{-1}$). While the $X$(SiO) does not exhibit any strong correlation with the evolutionary stages of their host clumps, $L_{\rm SiO}$ is highly correlated with dust clump mass, and $L_{\rm SiO}/L_{\rm bol}$ also has a strong negative correlation with $T_{\rm dust}$. This shows that colder and younger clumps have high $L_{\rm SiO}/L_{\rm bol}$ suggestive of an evolutionary trend. This trend is not due to excess emission at higher velocities, such as SiO wing features, as the colder sources with high $L_{\rm SiO}/L_{\rm bol}$ ratios lack wing features. Comparing SiO emission with H$_2$O and Class I CH$_3$OH masers, we find a significant correlation between $L_{\rm SiO}$/$L_{\rm bol}$ and $L_{\rm CH_3OH}/L_{\rm bol}$ ratios, whereas no similar correlation is seen for the H$_2$O maser emission. This suggests a similar origin for the SiO and Class I CH$_3$OH emission in these sources.
#### Multi-wavelength analysis of the galactic PeVatron candidate LHAASO  J2108+5157

 - **Abstract**
 LHAASO J2108+5157 is a recently discovered source, detected in the Ultra-High-Energy band by the LHAASO collaboration. Two molecular clouds were identified in the direction coincident with LHAASO J2108+5157 and, from the spectra reported by LHAASO, there is no sign of an energy cutoff up to 200 TeV. This source makes a promising galactic PeVatron candidate. In 2021, the Large-Sized Telescope prototype (LST-1) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) Observatory, collected about 50 hours of quality-selected data on LHAASO J2108+5157. Through these observations, we managed to compute stringent upper limits on the source emission in the multi-TeV band. Together with the analysis of XMM-Newton data and 12 years of Fermi-LAT data, we performed a multi-wavelength study of the source, investigating different possible scenarios of particle acceleration. In this contribution, we will present the results of the analysis, as well as the multi-wavelength modeling, and consequent interpretation of different possible scenarios of emission.
#### Dust depletion of of metals from local to distant galaxies II: Cosmic  dust-to-metal ratio and dust composition

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of the cosmic dust content and the cycle between metals and dust in the interstellar medium (ISM) plays a fundamental role in galaxy evolution. The chemical enrichment of the Universe can be traced through the evolution of the dust-to-metals ratio (DTM) and the dust-to-gas ratio (DTG) with metallicity. We use a novel method to determine mass estimates of the DTM, DTG and dust composition based on our previous measurements of the depletion of metals in different environments (the Milky Way, the Magellanic Clouds, and damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers, DLAs, toward quasars and towards gamma-ray bursts, GRBs), which were calculated from the relative abundances of metals in the ISM through absorption-line spectroscopy column densities observed mainly from VLT/UVES and X-shooter, and HST/STIS. We derive the dust extinction from the estimated dust depletion ($A_{V, \rm depl}$) and compare with the $A_{V}$ from extinction. We find that the DTM and DTG ratios increase with metallicity and with the dust tracer [Zn/Fe]. This suggests that grain growth in the ISM is a dominant process of dust production. The increasing trend of the DTM and DTG with metallicity is in good agreement with a dust production and evolution model. Our data suggest that the stellar dust yield is much lower than the metal yield and thus that the overall amount of dust in the warm neutral medium that is produced by stars is much lower. We find that $A_{V,\rm depl}$ is overall lower than $A_{V, \rm ext}$ for the Milky Way and a few Magellanic Clouds lines of sight, a discrepancy that is likely related to the presence of carbonaceous dust. We show that the main elements that contribute to the dust composition are, O, Fe, Si, Mg, C, S, Ni and Al for all the environments. Abundances at low dust regimes suggest the presence of pyroxene and metallic iron in dust.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the last decade, precise exoplanet transmission spectroscopy has revealed the atmospheres of dozens of exoplanets, driven largely by observatories like the \textit{Hubble} Space Telescope. One major discovery has been the ubiquity of atmospheric aerosols, often blocking access to exoplanet chemical inventories. Tentative trends have been identified, showing that the clarity of planetary atmospheres may depend on equilibrium temperature. Previous work has often grouped dissimilar planets together in order to increase the statistical power of any trends, but it remains unclear from observed transmission spectra whether these planets exhibit the same atmospheric physics and chemistry. We present a re-analysis of a smaller, more physically similar sample of 15 exo-Neptune transmission spectra across a wide range of temperatures (200-1000 K). Using condensation cloud and hydrocarbon haze models, we find that the exo-Neptune population is best described by very low cloud sedimentation efficiency ($\mathrm{f_{sed}}\sim0.01$) and high metallicity ($100\times$ Solar). There is an intrinsic astrophysical scatter of $\sim0.5$ scale height, perhaps evidence of stochasticity in these planets' formation processes. Observers should expect significant attenuation in transmission spectra of Neptune-size exoplanets, up to 6 scale heights for equilibrium temperatures between 500 and 800~K. With JWST's greater wavelength sensitivity, colder ($<500$~K) planets should be high-priority targets given their comparative rarity, clearer atmospheres, and the need to distinguish between the ``super-puffs'' and more typical gas-dominated planets.
