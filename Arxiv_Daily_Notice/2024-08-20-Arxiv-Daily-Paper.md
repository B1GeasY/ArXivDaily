 - **Abstract**
 Water must condense into ice clouds in the coldest brown dwarfs and exoplanets. When they form, these icy clouds change the emergent spectra, temperature structure, and albedo of the substellar atmosphere. The properties of clouds are governed by complex microphysics but these complexities are often not captured by the simpler parameterized cloud models used in climate models or retrieval models. Here, we combine microphysical cloud modeling and 1D climate modeling to incorporate insights from microphysical models into a self-consistent, parameterized cloud model. Using the 1D Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA), we generate microphysical water clouds and compare their properties with those from the widely-used EddySed cloud model (Ackerman & Marley 2001) for a grid of Y dwarfs. We find that the mass of water condensate in our CARMA water clouds is significantly limited by available condensation nuclei; in models without additional seed particles for clouds added, the atmosphere becomes supersaturated. We incorporate water latent heat release in the convective and radiative parts of the atmosphere and find no significant impact on water-ice cloud formation for typical gas giant compositions. Our analysis reveals the CARMA cloud profiles have a gradual decrease in opacity of approximately 4% per bar below the cloud base. Incorporating this gradual cloud base falloff and a variable $f_{sed}$ parameter allows spectra generated from the parameterized Eddysed model to better match those of the microphysical CARMA model. This work provides recommendations for efficiently generating microphysically-informed water clouds for future models of cold substellar objects with H/He atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric retrievals are widely used to constrain exoplanet properties from observed spectra. We investigate how the common nonphysical retrieval assumptions of vertically constant molecule abundances and cloud-free atmospheres affect our characterization of an exo-Earth (an Earth-twin orbiting a Sun-like star). Specifically, we use a state-of-the-art retrieval framework to explore how assumptions for the $\mathrm{H_2O}$ profile and clouds affect retrievals. In a first step, we validate different retrieval models on a low-noise simulated 1D mid-infrared (MIR) spectrum of Earth. Thereafter, we study how these assumptions affect the characterization of Earth with the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE). We run retrievals on LIFE mock observations based on real disk-integrated MIR Earth spectra. The performance of different retrieval models is benchmarked against ground truths derived from remote sensing data. We show that assumptions for the $\mathrm{H_2O}$ abundance and clouds directly affect our characterization. Overall, retrievals that use physically motivated models for the $\mathrm{H_2O}$ profile and clouds perform better on the empirical Earth data. For observations of Earth with LIFE, they yield accurate estimates for the radius, pressure-temperature structure, and the abundances of $\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\mathrm{H_2O}$, and $\mathrm{O_3}$. Further, at $R=100$, a reliable and bias-free detection of the biosignature $\mathrm{CH_4}$ becomes feasible. We conclude that the community must use a diverse range of models for temperate exoplanet atmospheres to build an understanding of how different retrieval assumptions can affect the interpretation of exoplanet spectra. This will enable the characterization of distant habitable worlds and the search for life with future space-based instruments.
#### Evidence for hybrid gamma-ray emission from the supernova remnant G150.3+4.5

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09141

 - **Abstract**
 The supernova remnant (SNR) G150.3+4.5 was first identified in radio, exhibiting a hard GeV spectrum and a $\sim 1.5^\circ$ radius. Radio observations revealed a bright arc with an index of $\sim -0.40$, which stands in contrast to the index of $\sim -0.69$ for the rest. This arc is coincident with the point-like \emph{Fermi} source 4FGL J0426.5+5434 and KM2A source 1LHAASO J0428+5531. The rest of the SNR has a hard GeV spectrum and a soft TeV spectrum, implying a spectral cut-off or break near 1 TeV. Since there is no X-ray counterpart and no pulse signal detected, the gamma-ray $(\gamma$-ray) emission mechanism from the SNR and the point-like source appear puzzling. In this work, we reanalyse the $\gamma$-ray emission using 14 yr data recorded by \emph{Fermi} Large Area Telescope and find that the spectrum of the northern half-sphere is compatible with a broken power law with a break at 146 $\pm$ 11 GeV and photon indices of $\Gamma_{\rm{Northlobe}}$ =$1.54\pm0.04_{\rm{stat}}\pm0.07_{\rm{syst}}$ ($2.28\pm0.08_{\rm{stat}}\pm0.12_{\rm{syst}}$) below (above) the break. In addition, the southern half-sphere can be described well with a single power law with $\Gamma_{\rm{Southlobe}}$ =$1.95\pm0.07_{\rm{stat}}\pm0.09_{\rm{syst}}$. Since the southern half-sphere is well correlated with CO emission, we propose that the $\gamma$-ray emission of the northern half-sphere could be dominated by relativistic electrons via inverse-Compton processes, while the southern half-sphere is dominated by cosmic rays via hadronic processes. 4FGL J0426.5+5434 may result from the illumination of a cloud by escaping cosmic rays or recent shock-cloud interaction. Observations from LHAASO-KM2A thus favour the possibility of a cosmic-ray PeVatron candidate, however, leptonic scenarios cannot be ruled out. Further multi-wavelength observations are warranted to confirm the hadronic nature of 1LHAASO J4028+5531.
#### Parabolic-like Trend in SiO Ratios throughout the Central Molecular Zone: Possible Signature of a Past Nuclear Activity in the Galactic Center

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a characteristic trend in the intensity ratios of SiO emissions across the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy. Using the Nobeyama Radio Observatory 45-m telescope, we conducted large-scale, high-sensitivity imaging observations in molecular lines including SiO $J$=2$-$1 and CS $J$=2$-$1. By identifying SiO-emitting clouds and examining their intensity ratios relative to the other molecular lines, we unveiled a parabolic-like trend showing lower ratios near the Galactic nucleus, Sgr A$^*$, with gradual increases toward the edges of the CMZ. This pattern suggests a possible outburst of the nucleus within the last $\sim 10^5$ yr, which may have propagated through the entire CMZ with strong shocks. Alternatively, the observed trend may also be attributed to the destruction of small dust grains by high-energy photons. Our results can potentially lead to a new perspective on the history of nuclear activity and its impact on the surrounding molecular environment.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been proposed that core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) can take place along with the generation of a jet that fails to emerge from the stellar envelope of the progenitor star, i.e., a choked jet. Although the fraction of CCSNe that harbour such jets is unknown, it remains as an interesting possibility that can give rise to the production of high-energy neutrinos. In this work, we focus on the particular case of the recent type II supernova, SN 2023ixf, the closest of its class in the last decade. We describe the particle distributions of protons, pions, and muons in a putative jet applying a simple model to account for the relevant interactions, which are synchrotron cooling and interactions with the soft photon field in the ambient. After evaluating the produced fluence for different values of the viewing angle $i_{\rm j}$ with respect to the jet axis, and comparing with the upper bound by IceCube, we conclude that the generation of a choked jet in SN 2023ixf can not be ruled out. Specifically, for typical jet Lorentz factors of the jet $\Gamma=100$, the jet could have been produced with an half-opening angle $\theta_{\rm op}=0.2\,{\rm rad}$ but for a viewing angle $i_{\rm j}\gtrsim \theta_{\rm op}$, no significant Doppler boosting would take place along this direction. Therefore, the choked jet scenario in SN 2023ixf still remains compatible with observations provided our line of sight corresponds to an off-axis view of the jet.
#### On the Formation of Planets in the Milky Way's Thick Disk

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanet demographic surveys have revealed that close-in (${\lesssim}$1 au) small planets orbiting stars in the Milky Way's thick disk are ${\sim}50\%$ less abundant than those orbiting stars in the Galactic thin disk. One key difference between the two stellar populations is the time at which they emerged: thick disk stars are the likely product of cosmic noon (redshift $z {\sim}2$), an era characterized by high star formation rate, massive and dense molecular clouds, and strong supersonic turbulence. Solving for the background radiation field in these early star-forming regions, we demonstrate that protoplanetary disks at cosmic noon experienced radiation fields up to ${\sim}7$ orders of magnitude more intense than in solar neighborhood conditions. Coupling the radiation field to a one-dimensional protoplanetary disk evolution model, we find that external UV photoevaporation destroys protoplanetary disks in just ${\sim}$0.2--0.5 Myr, limiting the timescale over which planets can assemble. Disk temperatures exceed the sublimation temperatures of common volatile species for ${\gtrsim}$Myr timescales, predicting more spatial homogeneity in gas chemical composition. Our calculations imply that the deficit in planet occurrence around thick disk stars should be even more pronounced for giant planets, particularly those at wide orbital separations, predicting a higher rocky-to-giant planet ratio in the Galactic thick disk vs.~thin disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs and planetary-mass companions display rotationally modulated photometric variability, especially those near the L/T transition. This variability is commonly attributed to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) inhomogeneities, with proposed models including patchy thick and thin clouds, planetary-scale jets, or chemical disequilibrium. Surface mapping techniques are powerful tools to probe their atmospheric structures and distinguish between models. One of the most successful methods for stellar surface mapping is Doppler imaging, where the existence of TOA inhomogeneities can be inferred from their varying Doppler shifts across the face of a rotating star. We applied Doppler imaging to the nearest brown dwarf binary WISE 1049AB (aka Luhman 16AB) using time-resolved, high-resolution spectroscopic observations from Gemini IGRINS, and obtained for the first time H and K band simultaneous global weather map for brown dwarfs. Compared to the only previous Doppler map for a brown dwarf in 2014 featuring a predominant mid-latitude cold spot on WISE 1049B and no feature on WISE 1049A, our observations detected persistent spot-like structures on WISE 1049B in the equatorial to mid-latitude regions on two nights, and revealed new polar spots on WISE 1049A. Our results suggest stability of atmospheric features over timescale of days and possible long-term stable or recurring structures. H and K band maps displayed similar structures in and out of CO bands, indicating the cold spots not solely due to chemical hotspots but must involve clouds. Upcoming 30-m extremely large telescopes (ELTs) will enable more sensitive Doppler imaging of dozens of brown dwarfs and even a small number of directly-imaged exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic force is a fundamental force in nature. Although widely believed to be important in counterbalancing against collapse in star formation, a clear evaluation of the role of the magnetic field in star formation remains hard to achieve. Past research attempts to evaluate the importance of magnetic forces using diagnostics such as the mass-to-flux ratio, which measures its strength but not how it functions. Since star formation is a complex process and the observed regions have complex structures, mapping the importance of the magnetic field is necessary. We propose a new technique, the Curvature Mapping Method, to evaluate the role of the magnetic force by providing maps of the magnetic force estimated using polarization observations. The Curvature Mapping Method provides maps with the contribution of the magnetic force clearly outlined. We apply the method to the star formation region of Orion A and provide a first quantitative result where the magnetic force arising from the pinched magnetic field does provide support against gravity. By comparing it against the gravitational force, we find that the magnetic force is enough to affect the low-density gas but is insufficient to support the dense region from collapse. The method effectively uses information contained in polarization maps and can be applied to data from surveys to understand the role of the B-field.
#### Unraveling the untwisting process and upward mass transfer of a twisted prominence driven by vortex motion

 - **Abstract**
 Solar filaments/prominences are common features in the Sun's atmosphere that contain cool chromospheric material suspended within the hot corona. However, the intricate topology of these structures and the mechanisms driving their instability and upward material transfer are not well understood. This study is to analyze a specific twisted prominence on February 10, 2021, and to explore its dynamics, including stability, motion, and material transfer. The study utilizes high-resolution H$\alpha$ observations from the 1-m New Vacuum Solar Telescope and space-borne observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory. We analyzed the data to investigate the characteristics and behavior of the twisted prominence. We also detected and measured the outflow speed surrounding the prominence. The study reveals that the observed prominence exhibited a stretched and twisted structure at its apex, distinguishing it from familiar cloudy prominences. Following more than 30 hours of equilibrium, the prominence destabilized, leading to a series of dynamic phenomena, such as vortex motion, oscillations, resonations, untwisting, and the upward transfer of mass. Consequently, material from the top of the prominence was carried upward and deposited into the overlying magnetic arcades. Noteworthy, outflows surrounding the prominence were characterized by speeds exceeding 40 km $s^{-1}$. We propose, for the first time, a mechanism rooted in the Kármán Vortex Street instability to explain the destabilization of the prominence. The estimated typical Strouhal Number of 0.23$\pm$0.06, which is related to vortex shedding, falls within the expected range for the Kármán Vortex Street effect, as predicted by simulations. These discoveries provide new insights into the dynamics and fundamental topology of solar prominences and reveal a previously unknown mechanism for mass loading into the upper atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the optimal sampling model, we synthesized the embedded clusters of ATLASGAL clumps with HII regions (HII-clumps). The 0.1 Myr isochrone was used to estimate the bolometric luminosity of each star in an embedded cluster, we also added the accretion luminosity of each star in the embeded cluster. The total bolometric luminosity of synthetic embedded clusters can well fit the observed bolometric luminosity of HII-clumps. More realistically, we considered the age spread in the young star and protostar populations in embedded clusters of HII-clumps by modeling both constant and time-varying star formation histories (SFHs). According to the age distribution of the stellar population, we distributed the appropriate isochrones to each star, and sorted out the fraction of stellar objects that are still protostars (Class 0 and Class I phases) to properly add their accretion luminosities. Compared to a constant SFH, burst-like and time-dependent SFHs can better fit the observational data. We found that as long as 20\% of the stars within the embedded cluster are still accreting, the contribution of accretion luminosity will be significant to the total bolometric luminosity of low-mass HII-clumps with mass log$_{10}$(M$_{\rm cl}$/M$_{\odot}$) $<$ 2.8. Variations in the accretion rate, the SFE and the initial mass function (IMF) and more physical processes like the external heating from HII regions and the flaring from pre-main sequence (PMS) stars and protostars need to be investigated to further explain the excess luminosity of low-mass HII-clumps.
#### Anatomy of the Star-formation in a Tidally Disturbed Disk galaxy: NGC 3718

 - **Abstract**
 We present a UV, optical and near-infrared (near-IR) study of the star-forming complexes in the nearby peculiar galaxy NGC 3718, using UVIT, GALEX, Spitzer and DECaLS imaging data. The galaxy has a disturbed optical morphology due to the multiple tidal arms, the warped disk and the prominent curved dust lanes, but in the near-IR, it appears to be a bulge-dominated galaxy. Its disturbed morphology makes it an excellent case to study star formation in a tidally disturbed galaxy that may have undergone a recent minor merger. To study the distribution and properties of the star-forming clumps (SFCs), we divided the galaxy within the R$_{25}$ (B band) radius into three parts --the upper, central and lower regions. Using the UV band images, we investigated the warped star-forming disk, the extended tidal arms, and the distribution and sizes of the 182 SFCs. Their distribution is 49, 60 and 73 in the galaxy's upper, central and lower regions, respectively. We determined the UV color, star-formation rates (SFRs), star-formation density ($\Sigma_{SFR}$) and ages of the SFCs.The central disk of the galaxy has a larger mean $\Sigma_{SFR}$ which is $\sim$3.3 and $\sim$1.6 times higher than the upper and lower regions, respectively. We also find that the SFCs in the central disk are older than those in the tidal arms. Our study thus shows that minor mergers can trigger the inside-out growth of galaxy disks, where the younger SFCs are in outer tidal arms and not in the inner disk.
#### Observation of the $\gamma$-ray Emission from W43 with LHAASO

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we report the detection of the very-high-energy (VHE, $ 100{\rm\ GeV} < E < 100{\rm\ TeV} $) and ultra-high-energy (UHE, $E > 100\rm\ TeV$) $\gamma$-ray emissions from the direction of the young star-forming region W43, observed by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observation (LHAASO). The extended $\gamma$-ray source was detected with a significance of ${\sim}16\,\sigma$ by KM2A and ${\sim}17\,\sigma$ by WCDA, respectively. The angular extension of this $\gamma$-ray source is about 0.5 degrees, corresponding to a physical size of about 50 pc. We discuss the origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission and possible cosmic ray acceleration in the W43 region using multi-wavelength data. Our findings suggest that W43 is likely another young star cluster capable of accelerating cosmic rays (CRs) to at least several hundred TeV.
#### On the flux density spectral property of high linearly polarized signal from Pulsar J0332+5434

 - **Abstract**
 The polarization position angles (PPA) of time samples with high linear polarization often show two parallel tracks across the pulsar profile that follow the rotating vector model (RVM). This feature support coherent curvature radiation (CCR) as the underlying mechanism of radio emission from pulsars, where the parallel tracks of the PPA represent the orthogonal extraordinary X and ordinary O eigen modes of strongly magnetized pair plasma. However, the frequency evolution of these high linearly polarized signals remains unexplored. In this work we explore the flux density spectral nature of high linearly polarized signals by studying the emission from PSR J0332+5434 over a frequency range between 300 MHz and 750 MHz, using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. The pulsar average profile comprises of a central core and a pair of conal components. We find the high linearly polarized time samples to be broadband in nature and in many cases they resemble a narrow spiky feature in the conal regions. These spiky features are localised within a narrow pulse longitude, over the entire frequency range, and their spectral shapes sometimes resemble an inverted parabolic shape. In all such cases the PPA are exclusively along one of the orthogonal RVM tracks, likely corresponding to the X-mode. The inverted spectral shape can in principle be explained if the high linearly polarized emission in these time samples are formed due to incoherent addition of CCR from a large number of charged solitons (charge bunches) exciting the X-mode.
#### Magnetic Fields in Massive Star-forming Regions (MagMaR) IV: Tracing the Magnetic Fields in the O-type protostellar system IRAS 16547$-$4247

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of the massive stars, and in particular, the role that the magnetic fields play in their early evolutionary phase is still far from being completely understood. Here, we present Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.2 mm full polarized continuum, and H$^{13}$CO$^+$(3$-$2), CS(5$-$4), and HN$^{13}$C(3$-$2) line observations with a high angular resolution ($\sim$0.4$''$ or 1100 au). In the 1.2 mm continuum emission, we reveal a dusty envelope surrounding the massive protostars, IRAS16547-E and IRAS16547-W, with dimensions of $\sim$10,000 au. This envelope has a bi-conical structure likely carved by the powerful thermal radio jet present in region. The magnetic fields vectors follow very-well the bi-conical envelope. The polarization fraction is $\sim$2.0\% in this region. Some of these vectors seem to converge to IRAS 16547-E, and IRAS 16547-W, the most massive protostars. Moreover, the velocity fields revealed from the spectral lines H$^{13}$CO$^+$(3$-$2), and HN$^{13}$C(3$-$2) show velocity gradients with a good correspondence with the magnetic fields, that maybe are tracing the cavities of molecular outflows or maybe in some parts infall. We derived a magnetic field strength in some filamentary regions that goes from 2 to 6.1\,mG. We also find that the CS(5$-$4) molecular line emission reveals multiple outflow cavities or bow-shocks with different orientations, some of which seem to follow the NW-SE radio thermal jet.
