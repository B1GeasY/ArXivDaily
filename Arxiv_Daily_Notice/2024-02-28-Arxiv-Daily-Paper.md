 - **Abstract**
 In the regime of cosmology and large-scale structure formation, filaments are vital components of the cosmic web. This study employs statistical methods to examine the formation, evolution, and cosmological constraints of filaments identified by DisPerSe. We run large-sample of N-body simulations to study the filament length and mass functions and their evolution. In general, the filament length function can be fitted by a power law with both the normalization and power index dependent on redshift and cosmological parameters. It is discovered that filament properties are influenced by various cosmological parameters, with $\sigma_8$ and $n_s$ exhibiting slightly stronger dependence than $\Omega_m$. We also uncover a three-stage filament formation process from $z \sim 3$ to $z \sim 1$: rapid formation of long and short filaments from $z \sim 3$ to $z \sim 2$, persistence of long filaments from $z \sim 2$ to $z \sim 1$, followed by fragmentation and increased prevalence of shorter filaments below $z \sim 1$. Additionally, both large and small-scale perturbations in power spectrum influence filament growth, with a characteristic scale around $k \sim 0.265$, wherein changes in matter fluctuations larger than this scale result in the formation of long filaments, while changes smaller than this scale have the opposite effect. These insights enhance our understanding of filament evolution and their cosmological relevance and also highlight their potential cosmological applications in observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The challenge of inconsistent results from different data pipelines, even when starting from identical data, is a recognized concern in exoplanetary science. As we transition into the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) era and prepare for the ARIEL space mission, addressing this issue becomes paramount because of its implications on our understanding of exoplanets. Although comparing pipeline results for individual exoplanets has become more common, this study is the first to compare pipeline results at the catalogue level. We present a comprehensive framework to statistically compare the outcomes of data analysis reduction on a population of exoplanets and we leverage the large number of observations conducted using the same instrument configured with HST-WFC3. We employ three independent pipelines: Iraclis, EXCALIBUR, and CASCADe. Our combined findings reveal that these pipelines, despite starting from the same data and planet system parameters, yield substantially different spectra in some cases. However, the most significant manifestations of pipeline differences are observed in the compositional trends of the resulting exoplanet catalogues. We conclude that pipeline-induced differences lead to biases in the retrieved information, which are not reflected in the retrieved uncertainties. Our findings underscore the critical need to confront these pipeline differences to ensure the reproducibility, accuracy, and reliability of results in exoplanetary research. Our results demonstrate the need to understand the potential for population-level bias that pipelines may inject, which could compromise our understanding of exoplanets as a class of objects.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15874
 - **Abstract**
 This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of various classification algorithms used for the detection of exoplanets using labeled time series data from the Kepler mission. The study investigates the performance of six commonly employed algorithms, namely Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree. The evaluation process involves analyzing a dataset that consists of time series measurements of star brightness, accompanied by labels indicating the presence or absence of exoplanets. To assess the effectiveness of each algorithm in accurately identifying exoplanets, performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are employed. The results demonstrate that the Random Forest algorithm achieves the highest accuracy of 94.2\%, followed closely by the Support Vector Machine with 93.8 percent accuracy. The Logistic Regression algorithm achieves an accuracy of 91.5 percent, while the K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree algorithms achieve accuracies of 89.6\%, 87.3\%, and 85.9\% respectively. Furthermore, the precision, recall, and F1 score metrics provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each classifier. The Random Forest algorithm exhibits a precision of 0.92, recall of 0.95, and F1 score of 0.93, indicating a balanced performance in correctly identifying both positive and negative instances. The Support Vector Machine also demonstrates strong performance with precision, recall, and F1 score values of 0.91, 0.94, and 0.92 respectively. The evaluation demonstrates that Random Forest and Support Vector Machine algorithms are well-suited for exoplanet detection using Kepler time series data. These findings enhance our understanding of the detection process and assist in selecting suitable algorithms for future studies.
#### Probing the physics of star formation (ProPStar): I. First resolved maps  of the electron fraction and cosmic-ray ionization rate in NGC 1333

 - **Abstract**
 Electron fraction and cosmic-ray ionization rates (CRIR) in star-forming regions are important quantities in astrochemical modeling and are critical to the degree of coupling between neutrals, ions, and electrons, which regulates the dynamics of the magnetic field. However, these are difficult quantities to estimate. We aim to derive the electron fraction and CRIR maps of an active star-forming region. We combined observations of the nearby NGC 1333 star-forming region carried out with the NOEMA interferometer and IRAM 30-m single dish to generate high spatial dynamic range maps of different molecular transitions. We used the DCO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ ratio (in addition to complementary data) to estimate the electron fraction and produce cosmic-ray ionization rate maps. We derived the first large-area electron fraction and CRIR resolved maps in a star-forming region, with typical values of $10^{-6.5}$ and $10^{-16.5}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively. The maps present clear evidence of enhanced values around embedded young stellar objects (YSOs). This provides strong evidence for locally accelerated cosmic rays. We also found a strong enhancement toward the northwest region in the map that might be related either to an interaction with a bubble or to locally generated cosmic rays by YSOs. We used the typical electron fraction and derived a MHD turbulence dissipation scale of 0.054 pc, which could be tested with future observations. We found a higher cosmic-ray ionization rate compared to the canonical value for $N({\rm H_2})=10^{21}-10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ of $10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$ in the region, and it is likely generated by the accreting YSOs. The high value of the electron fraction suggests that new disks will form from gas in the ideal-MHD limit. This indicates that local enhancements of $\zeta({\rm H_2})$, due to YSOs, should be taken into account in the analysis of clustered star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present COSBO-7, a strong millimeter (mm) source known for more than sixteen years but was just revealed its near-to-mid-IR counterpart by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The precise pin-pointing by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) on the exquisite NIRCam and MIRI images show that it is a background source gravitationally lensed by a single foreground galaxy, and the analysis of its spectral energy distribution by different tools consistently derives its photometric redshift at $\sim$7.7. Strikingly, our lens modeling based on the JWST data shows that it has a regular, disk morphology in the source plane. The dusty region giving rise to the far-IR-to-mm emission seems to be confined to a limited region to one side of the disk and has a high dust temperature of $>90$~K. The galaxy is experiencing starburst both within and outside of this dusty region. After taking the lensing magnification of $\mu\approx 2.5\mbox{-}3.6$ into account, the intrinsic star formation rate is several hundred $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ both within the dusty region and across the more extended stellar disk, and the latter already has $>10^{10}M_\odot$ of stars in place. If all this is true, COSBO-7 presents an extraordinary case that is against the common wisdom about galaxy formation in the early universe; simply put, its existence poses a critical question to be answered: how could a massive disk galaxy come into being so early in the universe and sustain its regular morphology in the middle of an enormous starburst?
#### Detection of possible glycine precursor molecule methylamine towards the  hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1

 - **Abstract**
 The search for the simplest amino acid, glycine (NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH), in the interstellar medium (ISM), has become a never-ending story for astrochemistry and astrophysics researchers because that molecule plays a possible connection between the Universe and the origin of life. In the last forty years, all searches for NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH in the ISM at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths have failed. Since the detection of NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH in the ISM was extremely difficult, we aimed to search for the possible precursors of NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH. Earlier, many laboratory experiments have suggested that methylamine (CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$) plays an important role in the ISM as a possible precursor of NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH. After spectral analysis using the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model, we identified the rotational emission lines of CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$ towards the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). The column density of CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$ towards the G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 was estimated to be (1.10$\pm$0.31)$\times$10$^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$ with an excitation temperature of 180.8$\pm$25.5 K. The fractional abundance of CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$ with respect to H$_{2}$ towards the G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 was (8.80$\pm$2.60)$\times$10$^{-8}$. The column density ratio of CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$ and NH$_{2}$CN towards G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 was (1.86$\pm$0.95)$\times$10$^{2}$. The estimated fractional abundance of CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$ towards the G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 agrees fairly well with the previous three-phase warm-up chemical modelling abundance of CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$. We also discussed the possible formation mechanism of CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$, and we find that CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$ is most probably formed via the reactions of radical CH$_{3}$ and radical NH$_{2}$ on the grain surface of G358.93$-$0.03 MM1.

 - **Abstract**
 The nuclear region of the Milky Way is believed to host a nuclear stellar disk, co-spatial with the gaseous central molecular zone. Previous kinematical studies detected faster rotation for the stars belonging to the nuclear stellar disk, compared to the surrounding regions. We analyze the rotation velocity of stars at the nuclear stellar disk, and compare them with its analog in a few control fields just outside this region. We limit our analysis to stars in the red clump of the color magnitude diagram, in order to be able to relate their mean de-reddened luminosity with distance along the line of sight. We used a proper motion catalog, obtained from point spread function photometry on VVV images, to construct maps of the transverse velocity for these stars. We complemented our analysis with radial velocities from the 17th data release of the APOGEE survey. We find that the main difference between the nuclear stellar disk region and its surroundings is that at the former we see only stars moving eastward, which we believe are located in front of the Galactic center. On the contrary, in every other direction, we see the brightest red clump stars moving eastward, and the faintest ones moving westward, as expected for a rotating disk. We interpret these observations as being produced by the central molecular zone, hiding stars behind itself. What we observe is compatible with being produced by just the absence of the component at the back, without requiring the presence of a cold, fast rotating disk. This component is also not clearly detected in the newest release of the APOGEE catalog. In other words, we find no clear signature of the nuclear stellar disk as a distinct kinematical component.
