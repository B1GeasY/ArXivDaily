 - **Abstract**
 The concept of electromotive field appears in various applications in space and astrophysical plasmas. A review is given on the electromotive field highlighting our current understanding of the theoretical picture and the spacecraft observations in interplanetary space. The electromotive field is a key concept to successfully close the set of turbulent magnetohydrodynamic equations and also to construct a more complete picture of space plasma turbulence. Applications to astrophysical cases (Earth magnetosphere, heliospheric shocks, interstellar medium, and relativistic jets) are also briefly introduced, as well.

 - **Abstract**
 Loop I/North Polar Spur (NPS) is the giant arc structure above the Galactic plane observed in the radio sky. It is the most conspicuous feature in low frequency radio sky maps besides the galactic plane itself. There is a long-standing debate about its origin. While the majority consider it as a nearby supernova remnant (SNR), it has also been suggested to be a giant bubble close to the Galactic Center (GC), associated with the Fermi Bubble and eROSITA X-ray bubble. There is also the possibility that a nearby SNR and a bubble near the GC happens to overlay each other. At ultralong wavelength band (wavelength $\gtrsim 10$ m or frequency $\lesssim 30$ MHz), particularly below $\sim 10$ MHz, the free-free absorption of radio signal by the diffuse electrons in interstellar medium (ISM) becomes significant, resulting in sky morphology differs largely from higher frequencies. In this paper, we predict the Loop I/NPS morphology at ultralong wavelength band. We develop emissivity models for the two Loop I/NPS origin models. We find that, at ultralong wavelength band, for the SNR model, the full Loop I/NPS is still a bright arc even at frequency as low as $\sim 1$ MHz; however, in the GC model, the Loop I/NPS appears only at $b\gtrsim 30\degree$, at $b\lesssim 30 \degree$ the Loop I/NPS is invisible due to the absorption by ISM electrons between the GC and the Sun. Upcoming ultralong wavelentgh projects such as DSL and FARSIDE can potentially distinguish these two models and provide decisive information about the origin of Loop I/NPS.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the rich star-forming core of the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex. The selection of the sample relies on detecting the inherent water absorption characteristic in young substellar objects. Of the 22 water-bearing candidates selected, 15 have a spectral type of M6 or later. Brown dwarf candidates too faint for membership determination by Gaia have their proper motions derived by deep-infrared images spanning six years. Astrometric analysis confirms 21/22 sources as members, one identified as a contaminant. Infrared colors and the spectral energy distribution of each water-bearing candidate are used to diagnose the mass, age, and possible existence of circumstellar dust. 15 sources exhibit evidence of disks in their spectral energy distributions, as late as in M8-type objects. Spectroscopy for bright candidates has confirmed one as an M8 member and verified two sources (with disks) exhibiting signatures of magnetospheric accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 Star clusters, including high-mass stars, form within hub-filament systems (HFSs). Observations of HFSs that remain unaffected by feedback from embedded stars are rare yet crucial for understanding the mass inflow process in high-mass star formation. Using the JWST NIRCAM images, Dewangan et al. 2024, reported that the high-mass protostar G11P1 is embedded in a candidate HFS (G11P1-HFS; $<0.6$ pc). Utilizing ALMA N$_{2}$H$^{+}$(1-0) data, we confirm the presence of G11P1-HFS and study the dense gas kinematics. We analyzed the position-position-velocity (PPV) map and estimated on-sky velocity gradient ($V_g$) and gravity ($\mathcal{F}_{g}$) vectors. The spatial distribution of gas velocity and H$_2$ column density was examined. The steep $V_g$ of 5 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ and $-$7 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ toward either side of G11P1-hub, and the decreasing $V_g$ toward the hub, identify G11P1-HFS as a small-scale HFS in its nascent phase. $V_g$ and $\mathcal{F}_{g}$ align along the filaments, indicating gravity-driven flows. This work highlights the wiggled, funnel-shaped morphology of a HFS in PPV space, suggesting the importance of subfilaments or transverse gas flows in mass transportation to the hub.

 - **Abstract**
 The IVOA Simple Image Access version 2 protocol defines an easy way to provide community access to a collection of data. At the Vera C. Rubin Observatory we currently enable ObsTAP access to our data holdings via an ObsCore export or view of our Data Butler repositories. This approach comes with some deployment constraints, such as requiring pgsphere and compatibility with our CADC TAP implementation, so recently we decided to see whether we could instead provide an SIAv2 service that talks directly to our Data Butler. Here we describe our motivation, implementation strategies, and current deployment status, as well as discussing some metadata mismatches between the Butler data models and SIAv2.
#### Detection of H2O and CO2 in the Atmosphere of the Hot Super-Neptune WASP-166b with JWST
 - **Authors:** Andrew W. Mayo, Charles D. Fortenbach, Dana R. Louie, Courtney D. Dressing, Steven Giacalone, Caleb K. Harada, Emma V. Turtelboom

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00609

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00609

 - **Abstract**
 We characterize the atmosphere of the hot super-Neptune WASP-166b ($P = 5.44$ d, $R_p = 6.9 \pm 0.3$ R$_\oplus$, $M_p = 32.1 \pm 1.6$ M$_\oplus$, $T_\mathrm{eq} = 1270 \pm 30$ K) orbiting an F9V star using JWST transmission spectroscopy observations obtained with NIRISS SOSS Order-1 and NIRSpec BOTS G395M/F290LP. Our combined spectrum spans wavelengths $0.85$ to $5.17$ $\mu$m (GO ID 2062, PI: Mayo). WASP-166b resides near the edge of the Hot Neptune Desert, a scarcity of intermediate-sized planets at high insolation fluxes; thus, exploring the atmospheric composition and formation processes of WASP-166b can provide insights into the mechanisms sculpting this parameter space. Our POSEIDON free chemistry retrievals confirm the detection of H$_2$O ($15.2\sigma$ significance) and detect CO$_2$ ($14.7\sigma$) for the first time in the planet atmosphere. We also find a hint of NH$_3$ ($2.3\sigma$) and an intermediate pressure cloud deck ($2.6\sigma$). Finally, we report non-detections of CH$_4$, CO, C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, SO$_2$, and H$_2$S. We verify our results using a TauREx free chemistry retrieval. We also measure with POSEIDON a high planetary atmospheric metallicity ($\log(Z) = 1.57^{+0.17}_{-0.18}$, $Z = 37^{+18}_{-13}$) and a potentially substellar C/O ratio for the planet ($C/O = 0.282^{+0.078}_{-0.053}$) compared to the star ($C/O_* = 0.41 \pm 0.08$), suggesting a formation pathway for WASP-166b that includes planetesimal accretion followed by core erosion or photoevaporation, which may indicate these to be plausible driving processes in the formation of the Hot Neptune Desert.
#### Unraveling the kinematic and morphological evolution of the Small Magellanic Cloud

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00788

 - **Abstract**
 We modeled the kinematics of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) by analyzing the proper motion (PM) from Gaia DR3 of nine different stellar populations, which include young main sequence (MS) stars (< 2 Gyr), red giant branch stars, red clump stars, red giants with line-of-sight velocities, and three groups of star clusters. This analysis was carried out using a robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to derive up to 7 kinematic parameters. We trace the evolution from a non-rotating flattened elliptical system as mapped by the old population to a rotating highly stretched disk structure as denoted by the young MS stars and clusters (< 400 Myr). We estimated that the inclination, i (~ 58$^\circ$ to 82$^\circ$) decreases and the position angle, $\Theta$ (~ 180$^\circ$ to 240$^\circ$) increases with age. We estimated an asymptotic velocity of ~ 49 - 89 km s$^{-1}$ with scale-radius of ~ 6 - 9 kpc for the young MS populations with velocity dispersion of ~ 11 km s$^{-1}$, suggesting a rotation-supported disk structure. Our models estimate a line-of-sight extension of ~ 30 kpc, in agreement with observations. We identified four regions of the SMC showing anomalies in the residual PM, the East Anomaly (EA), South East Anomaly (SEA), South Anomaly (SA), and West Anomaly (WA). The SEA appears like an infalling feature and is identified for the first time. The tidal imprints observed in the residual PM of the SMC suggest that its evolution is considerably shaped by the recent interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents stellar weak rates and mass fractions of 20 most important electron capture (ec) and beta decay (bd) nuclei with $A < 65$ according to a recent study during the presupernova evolution of massive stars. The mass fractions of these nuclei were calculated using the Sahas equation which assumes nuclear statistical equilibrium for a set of initial conditions ($T_9$, $\rho$ and $Y_e$) that represents the trajectory which a massive stars central region takes after its silicon core burns. Our computed mass fractions were found in decent comparison in most cases, and up to a factor 4 difference was noted when compared with the Independent Particle Model results. The weak interaction (ec and bd) rates were calculated in a totally microscopic fashion using the proton neutron quasiparticle random phase ap proximation model and without assuming the Brink Axel hypothesis. The rates were computed for a wide range of density ($10$-$10^{11}$) g/cm$^3$ and temperature (0.01-30) GK. In comparison with large scale shell model, our computed rates were found bigger at high values of core temperature. The current study may contribute in a more realistic simu lation of stellar evolution processes and modeling of core collapse supernovae.
#### SpecPT (Spectroscopy Pre-trained Transformer) Model for Extragalactic Spectroscopy: I. Architecture and Automated Redshift Measurement

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce the Spectroscopy Pre-trained Transformer (SpecPT), a transformer-based model designed to analyze spectroscopic data, with applications in spectrum reconstruction and redshift measurement. Using the Early Data Release (EDR) of the DESI survey, we evaluate SpecPT's performance on two distinct datasets: the Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) and Emission Line Galaxy (ELG) samples. SpecPT successfully reconstructs spectra, accurately capturing emission lines, absorption features, and continuum shapes while effectively reducing noise. For redshift prediction, SpecPT achieves competitive accuracy, with Normalized Median Absolute Deviation (NMAD) values of 0.0006 and 0.0008, and catastrophic outlier fractions of 0.20% and 0.80% for BGS and ELG, respectively. Notably, SpecPT performs consistently well across the full redshift range ($0 < z < 1.6$), demonstrating its versatility and robustness. By leveraging its learned latent representations, SpecPT lays the groundwork for a foundational spectroscopic model, with potential applications in outlier detection, interstellar medium (ISM) property estimation, and transfer learning to other datasets. This work represents a first step in building a generalized framework for spectroscopic analysis, capable of scaling to the full DESI dataset and beyond.
#### First Search for Pulsed CH Maser Emission Stimulated by a Pulsar

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first search for pulsed CH maser emission potentially stimulated by PSR J1644$-$4559, conducted using the ultra-wide-bandwidth low-frequency receiver on Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes Radio Telescope. Observations targeted three CH $\Lambda$-doublet transitions at 3264, 3335, and 3349 MHz, with a variability timescale of 78 ms. We detected ten CH emission features at 3335 and 3349 MHz, and seven features at 3264 MHz, during both pulsar-ON and pulsar-OFF phases. The observed velocities align with the OH emission and absorption reported by a previous study, suggesting a close spatial association between CH and OH molecules. The derived column densities for CH clouds within the Parkes beam range from $0.05$ to $9.8 \times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, indicating that these clouds are likely in diffuse and translucent states. Upper limits for CH column densities within the pulsar beam ranged from $0.3$ to $9.8 \times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. Comparison of these column densities suggests that CH clouds may exhibit clumpiness and substructure. No significant stimulated emission feature was detected in the optical depth spectra. Additionally, as part of our search for pulsed stimulated emission, we investigated the potential CH absorption of the pulsar signal and found none, in agreement with astrophysical expectations. The upper limits for the potential maser amplification factors towards PSR J1644$-$4559 at 3264, 3335, and 3349 MHz are 1.014, 1.009, and 1.009, respectively. This study demonstrates the feasibility of detecting pulsed CH maser emission in the interstellar medium stimulated by pulsar photons.
#### Quasi-parallel anti-sunward propagating whistler waves associated to the electron-deficit in the near-Sun solar wind: Particle-in-Cell simulation

 - **Abstract**
 In-situ observations of the solar wind have shown that the electron velocity distribution function (VDF) consists of a quasi-Maxwellian core, comprising most of the electron population, and two sparser components: the halo, which are suprathermal and quasi-isotropic electrons, and an escaping beam population, the strahl. Recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SO) observations have added one more ingredient to the known non-thermal features, the deficit-a depletion in the sunward region of the VDF, already predicted by exospheric models but never so extensively observed. By employing Particle-in-Cell simulations, we study electron VDFs that reproduce those typically observed in the inner heliosphere and investigate whether the electron deficit may contribute to the onset of kinetic instabilities. Previous studies and in-situ observations show that strahl electrons drive oblique whistler waves unstable, which in turn scatter them. As a result, suprathermal electrons can occupy regions of phase space where they fulfil resonance conditions with the parallel-propagating whistler wave. The suprathermal electrons lose kinetic energy, resulting in the generation of unstable waves. The sunward side of the VDF, initially depleted of electrons, is gradually filled, as this wave-particle interaction process, triggered by the depletion itself, takes place. Our findings are compared and validated against current PSP and SO observations: among others, our study provides a mechanism explaining the presence in the heliosphere of regularly observed parallel anti-sunward whistler waves; suggests why these waves are frequently observed in concomitant with distributions presenting an electron deficit; describes a non-collisional heat flux regulating process.
