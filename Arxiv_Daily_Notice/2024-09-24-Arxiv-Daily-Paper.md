 - **Abstract**
 We present age estimates for over 8100 sub-giant branch (SGB) stars in Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) to study its star formation history. Our large data set, which combines multi-wavelength HST photometry with MUSE metallicities, provides an unprecedented opportunity to measure individual stellar ages. We do this by fitting each star's photometry and metallicity with theoretical isochrones, that are embedded with an empirical [C+N+O]-[Fe/H] relation specifically for $\omega$ Cen. The bulk of the stars have ages between 13 and 10 Gyr, with the mean stellar age being 12.08$\pm$0.01 Gyrs and the median age uncertainty being 0.68 Gyrs. From these ages we construct the most complete age-metallicity relation (AMR) for $\omega$ Cen to date. We find that the mean age of stars decreases with increasing metallicity and find two distinct streams in the age-metallicity plane, hinting at different star formation pathways. We derive an intrinsic spread in the ages of 0.75$\pm$0.01 Gyr for the whole cluster, with the age spread showing a clear increase with metallicity. We verify the robustness of our age estimations by varying isochrone parameters and constraining our systematics. We find the C+N+O relation to be the most critical consideration for constraining the AMR. We also present the SGB chromosome map with age information. In the future, these stellar ages could be combined with chemical abundances to study age differences in subpopulations, and uncover the chemical evolution history of this massive nuclear star cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate solar flare prediction is crucial due to the significant risks that intense solar flares pose to astronauts, space equipment, and satellite communication systems. Our research enhances solar flare prediction by utilizing advanced data preprocessing and classification methods on a multivariate time series-based dataset of photospheric magnetic field parameters. First, our study employs a novel preprocessing pipeline that includes missing value imputation, normalization, balanced sampling, near decision boundary sample removal, and feature selection to significantly boost prediction accuracy. Second, we integrate contrastive learning with a GRU regression model to develop a novel classifier, termed ContReg, which employs dual learning methodologies, thereby further enhancing prediction performance. To validate the effectiveness of our preprocessing pipeline, we compare and demonstrate the performance gain of each step, and to demonstrate the efficacy of the ContReg classifier, we compare its performance to that of sequence-based deep learning architectures, machine learning models, and findings from previous studies. Our results illustrate exceptional True Skill Statistic (TSS) scores, surpassing previous methods and highlighting the critical role of precise data preprocessing and classifier development in time series-based solar flare prediction.
#### Simulating the formation and eruption of flux rope by magneto-friction model driven by time-dependent electric fields

 - **Abstract**
 Aiming to capture the formation and eruption of flux ropes (FRs) in the source active regions (ARs), we simulate the coronal magnetic field evolution of the AR 11429 employing the time-dependent magneto-friction model (TMF). The initial field is driven by electric fields that are derived from time-sequence photospheric vector magnetic field observations by invoking ad-hoc assumptions. The simulated magnetic structure evolves from potential to twisted fields over the course of two days, followed by rise motion in the later evolution, depicting the formation of FR and its slow eruption later. The magnetic configuration resembles an inverse S-sigmoidal structure, composed of a potential field enveloping the inverse J-shaped fields that are shared past one another and a low lying twisted field along the major PIL. To compare with observations, proxy emission maps based on averaged current density along the field lines are generated from the simulated field. These emission maps exhibit a remarkable one-to-one correspondence with the spatial characteristics in coronal EUV images, especially the filament-trace supported by the twisted magnetic field in the south-west subregion. Further, the topological analysis of the simulated field reveals the co-spatial flare ribbons with the quasi-separatrix layers, which is consistent with the standard flare models; therefore, the extent of the twist and orientation of the erupting FR is indicated to be the real scenario in this case. The TMF model simulates the coronal field evolution, correctly capturing the formation of the FR in the observed time scale and the twisted field generated from these simulations serve as the initial condition for the full MHD simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 SN 2023tsz is a Type Ibn supernova (SNe Ibn) discovered in an extremely low-mass host. SNe Ibn are an uncommon subtype of stripped-envelope core-collapse SNe. They are characterised by narrow helium emission lines in their spectra and are believed to originate from the collapse of massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, though their progenitor systems still remain poorly understood. In terms of energetics and spectrophotometric evolution, SN 2023tsz is largely a typical example of the class, although line profile asymmetries in the nebular phase are seen, which may indicate the presence of dust formation or unshocked circumstellar material. Intriguingly, SN 2023tsz is located in an extraordinarily low-mass host galaxy that is in the 2nd percentile for SESN host masses and star formation rates (SFR). The host has a radius of 1.0 kpc, a $g$-band absolute magnitude of $-12.73$, and an estimated metallicity of $\log(Z_{*}/Z_{\odot}$) = $-1.56$. The SFR and metallicity of the host galaxy raise questions about the progenitor of SN 2023tsz. The low SFR suggests that a star with sufficient mass to evolve into a WR would be uncommon in this galaxy. Further, the very low-metallicity is a challenge for single stellar evolution to enable H and He stripping of the progenitor and produce a SN Ibn explosion. The host galaxy of SN 2023tsz adds another piece to the ongoing puzzle of SNe Ibn progenitors, and demonstrates that they can occur in hosts too faint to be observed in contemporary sky surveys at a more typical SN Ibn redshift.
#### Shock breakouts from compact CSM surrounding core-collapse SN progenitors may contribute significantly to the observed $\gtrsim10$ TeV neutrino background

 - **Abstract**
 Growing observational evidence suggests that enhanced mass loss from the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) is common during $\sim1$ yr preceding the explosion, creating an optically thick circum-stellar medium (CSM) shell at $\sim10^{14.5}$ cm radii. We show that if such mass loss is indeed common, then the breakout of the SN shock through the dense CSM shell produces a neutrino flux that may account for a significant fraction of the observed $\gtrsim10$ TeV neutrino background. The neutrinos are created within a few days from the explosion, during and shortly after the shock breakout, which produces also large UV (and later X-ray) luminosity. The compact size and large UV luminosity imply a pair production optical depth of $\sim10^4$ for $>100$ GeV photons, naturally accounting for the lack of a high-energy gamma-ray background accompanying the neutrino background. SNe producing $>1$ neutrino event in a 1 km$^2$ detector are expected at a rate of $\lesssim0.1$/yr. A quantitative theory describing the evolution of the electromagnetic spectrum during a breakout, as the radiation-mediated shock is transformed into a collisionless one, is required to enable (i) using data from upcoming surveys that will systematically detect large numbers of young, $<1$ d old SNe, to determine the pre-explosion mass loss history of the SN progenitor population, and (ii) a quantitative determination of the neutrino luminosity and spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 HOPS 87 is a Class 0 protostellar core known to harbor an extremely young bipolar outflow and a hot corino. We report the discovery of localized, chemically rich regions near the bases of the two-lobe bipolar molecular outflow in HOPS 87 containing molecules such as H$_2$CO, $^{13}$CS, H$_2$S, OCS, and CH$_3$OH, the simplest complex organic molecule (COM). The locations and kinematics suggest that these localized features are due to jet-driven shocks rather than being part of the hot corino region encasing the protostar. The COM compositions of the molecular gas in these jet-localized regions are relatively simpler than those in the hot corino zone. We speculate that this simplicity is due to either the liberation of ice with a less complex chemical history or the effects of shock chemistry. Our study highlights the dynamic interplay between the protostellar bipolar outflow, disk, inner core environment, and the surrounding medium, contributing to our understanding of molecular complexity in solar-like young stellar objects.

 - **Abstract**
 The early time observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) play a crucial role in investigating and resolving longstanding questions about progenitor stars and the explosion mechanisms of these events. Colors of supernovae (SNe) in the initial days after the explosion can help differentiate between different types of SNe. However, the use of true color information to identify SNe Ia at the early-time explosion is still in its infancy. The Multi-channel Photometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto) is a photometric survey telescope equipped with three CCD cameras, capable of simultaneously imaging the same patch of sky in three bands (\emph{u, g, i} or \emph{v, r, z}), yielding real-time colors of astronomical objects. In this paper, we introduce a new time-series classification tool named Mephisto Early Supernovae Ia Rapid Identifier (\emph{\texttt{Mesiri}}), which for the first time, utilizes real-time color information to distinguish early-time SNe Ia from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). \emph{\texttt{Mesiri}} is based on the deep learning approach and can achieve an accuracy of $96.75\pm0.79$\%, and AUC of $98.87\pm0.53$\% in case of single epoch random observation before the peak brightness. These values reach towards perfectness if additional data points on several night observations are considered. The classification with real-time color significantly outperforms that with pseudo-color, especially at the early time, i.e., with only a few points of observations. The architecture of BiLSTM shows the best performance than the others that have been tested in this work.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the potential of using gravitational wave (GW) signals from rotating core-collapse supernovae to probe the equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter. By generating GW signals from simulations with various EOSs, we train machine learning models to classify them and evaluate their performance. Our study builds on previous work by examining how different machine learning models, parameters, and data preprocessing techniques impact classification accuracy. We test convolutional and recurrent neural networks, as well as six classical algorithms: random forest, support vector machines, naive Bayes, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and eXtreme gradient boosting. All models, except naive Bayes, achieve over 90 per cent accuracy on our dataset. Additionally, we assess the impact of approximating the GW signal using the general relativistic effective potential (GREP) on EOS classification. We find that models trained on GREP data exhibit low classification accuracy. However, normalizing time by the peak signal frequency, which partially compensates for the absence of the time dilation effect in GREP, leads to a notable improvement in accuracy.

 - **Abstract**
 We present experiments to reproduce the characteristics of core-collapse supernovae with different stellar masses and initial explosion energies in the laboratory. In the experiments, shocks are driven in 1.2 atm and 1.9 atm xenon gas by laser with energy from 1600J to 2800J on the SGIII prototype laser facility. The average shock velocities and shocked densities are obtained from experiments. Experimental results reveal that higher laser energy and lower Xe gas density led to higher shock velocity, and lower Xe gas initial density has a higher compression. Modeling of the experiments using the 2D radiation hydrodynamic codes Icefire shows excellent agreement with the experimental results and gives the temperature. These results will contribute to time-domain astrophysical systems, such as gravitational supernovae, where a strong radiative shock propagates outward from the center of the star after the core collapses.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous transients in the universe. The interaction of the relativistic jet with the circumburst medium produces an afterglow and generates multiwavelength emission. In this work, we present simultaneous multiband photometry of GRB~240825A with the Multi-channel Photometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto) and analyze its temporal and spectral properties. The measurement began 128 seconds after the GRB trigger and continued until the fourth day when the afterglow essentially diminished and the measured brightness was close to that of the host galaxy. Based on the multiband light curves in the $uvgriz$ bands, we find that the optical flux density satisfies $F_{\nu,{\rm obs}}\propto t^{-1.34}\nu^{-2.48}$ with a spectral index of $2.48$ much larger than those of most other GRBs. To reconcile the measured much softer spectral energy distribution (SED) with that predicted by the standard afterglow model, an extra host-galaxy extinction of $E_{B-V}\sim(0.37-0.57)$ mag is required. We interpreted this excess as arising from a dense circumburst medium. We further find that the SED of the optical afterglow hardened as the afterglow decayed and the color excess $E_{B-V}$ decreased $\sim0.21$ mag in the first 3000 seconds. Finally, we analyze the properties of the host galaxy of GRB~240825A based on data from the SDSS, PanSTARRS and HSC-SSP surveys. For a host redshift of $z=0.659$, the stellar mass and star formation rate of the host galaxy are estimated to be $\log(M_*/M_\odot)=10.0^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$ and $\log({\rm SFR}/M_{\odot}{\rm yr}^{-1})= 0.6^{+0.8}_{-3.3}$, respectively, pointing to a gas-rich, star-forming, medium-size galaxy.
#### Partial disruption of a planet around a white dwarf: the effect of perturbation from the remnant planet on the accretion

 - **Abstract**
 About 25\% -50\% of white dwarfs (WDs) are found to be polluted by heavy elements. It has been argued that the pollution could be caused by the tidal disruption of an approaching planet around the WD, during which a large number of clumps would be produced and would finally fall onto the WD. The reason that the planet approaches the WD is usually believed to be due to gravitational perturbations from another distant planet or stellar companion. However, the dynamics of the perturbation and the detailed partial disruption process are still poorly understood. In this study, we present an in-depth investigation of these issues. A triple system composed of a WD, an inner orbit planet, and an outer orbit planet is considered. The inner plant would be partially disrupted periodically in the long-term evolution. Fragments generated in the process are affected by the gravitational perturbations from the remnant planet, facilitating their falling toward the WD. The mass loss rate of the inner planet depends on both its internal structure and also on the orbital configuration of the planetary system.
