 - **Abstract**
 Mergers between helium white dwarfs and main-sequence stars are likely common, producing red giant-like remnants making up roughly a few percent of all low-mass ($\lesssim2M_\odot$) red giants. Through detailed modelling, we show that these merger remnants possess distinctive photometric, asteroseismic, and surface abundance signatures through which they may be identified. During hydrogen shell burning, merger remnants reach higher luminosities and possess pulsations which depart from the usual degenerate sequence on the asteroseismic $\Delta\nu$--$\Delta\Pi$ diagram for red giant branch stars. For sufficiently massive helium white dwarfs, merger remnants undergo especially violent helium flashes which can dredge up a large amount of core material (up to $\sim0.1M_\odot$) into the envelope. Such post-dredge-up remnants are more luminous than normal red clump stars, surface carbon-rich, and possess a wider range of asteroseismic g-mode period spacings and mixed-mode couplings. Recently discovered low-mass ($\lesssim0.8M_\odot$) red clump stars may be core helium-burning remnants of mergers involving lower-mass helium white dwarfs.
#### JWST ERS Program Q3D: The pitfalls of virial BH mass constraints shown  in a z = 3 quasar with an ultramassive host

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST MIRI/NIRSpec observations of the extremely red quasar SDSS J165202.64+172852.3 at z~3, one of the most luminous quasars known to date, driving powerful outflows and hosting a clumpy starburst, amidst several interacting companions. We estimate the black hole (BH) mass of the system based on the broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines, as well as the Pa$\beta$ emission in the IR and MgII in the UV. We recover a very broad range of mass estimates, with constraints ranging between log $M_{\rm BH}$=9 and 10.1, which is exacerbated if imposing a uniform BLR geometry at all wavelengths. Several factors may contribute to the large spread: measurement uncertainties (insufficient sensitivity to detect the broadest component of the faint Pa$\beta$ line, spectral blending, ambiguities in the broad/narrow component distinction), lack of virial equilibrium (in a system characterised by powerful outflows and rapid accretion), and uncertainties on the luminosity-inferred size of the broad line region, a.o. given central dust obscuration. We constrain the stellar mass via SED fitting, suggesting the host to be extremely massive at $10^{12.8\pm 0.5} M_\odot$ - ~2 dex above the characteristic mass of the Schechter fit to the z=3 stellar mass function. Notably, J1652's central BH might be interpreted as being either undermassive, overmassive, or in line with the BH mass-stellar mass relation, depending on the choice of assumptions. The recovered Eddington ratio varies accordingly, but exceeds 10% in any case. We put our results into context by providing an extensive overview and discussion of recent literature results and their associated assumptions. Our findings provide an important demonstration of the uncertainties inherent in virial BH mass estimates, which are of particular relevance in the JWST era given the growing number of studies on rapidly accreting quasars at high redshift.
#### APPLE: An Evolution Code for Modeling Giant Planets
 - **Authors:** Ankan Sur, Yubo Su, Roberto Tejada Arevalo, Yi-Xian Chen, Adam Burrows
 - **Subjects:** Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14483
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14483
 - **Abstract**
 We introduce APPLE, a novel planetary evolution code designed specifically for the study of giant exoplanet and Jovian planet evolution in the era of Galileo, Juno, and Cassini. With APPLE, state-of-the-art equations of state for hydrogen, helium, ice, and rock are integrated with advanced features to treat ice/rock cores and metals in the gaseous envelope; models for helium rain and hydrogen/helium immiscibility; detailed atmosphere boundary tables that also provide self-consistent albedos and spectra; and options to address envelope metal gradients and stably-stratified regions. Our hope is that these purpose-built features of APPLE will help catalyze the development of the next generation of giant exoplanet and Jovian planet evolutionary models.
#### Impact of main-sequence mass loss on the appearance, structure and  evolution of Wolf-Rayet stars

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar winds are one of the most important drivers of massive star evolution and a vital source of chemical, mechanical, and radiative feedback. Despite its significance, mass loss remains a major uncertainty in stellar evolution models. Particularly the interdependencies of different approaches with subsequent evolutionary stages and predicted observable phenomena are far from being systematically understood. In this study, we examine the impact of main sequence mass loss on the structure of massive stars throughout their evolution. A particular focus is placed on the consequences for entering the Wolf-Rayet (WR) regime and the subsequent evolution. Using the Geneva stellar evolution code, we compute grids of single, non-rotating stellar models at solar and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) metallicity of initial masses between 20 and 120 solar masses, with two representative prescriptions for high and low main sequence mass loss. We obtain detailed numerical predictions regarding the structure and evolution of massive stars, and infer the role of main sequence mass loss by comparison of the mass-loss rate prescriptions. We present implications for the overall evolutionary trajectory, including the evolution of WR stars, as well as the effect on stellar yields and stellar populations. Mass loss during the main sequence plays an important role due to its ability to affect the sequence and duration of all subsequent phases. We identify several distinct evolutionary paths for massive stars which are significantly influenced by the chosen main sequence mass-loss description. We also discuss the impact of uncertainties other than mass loss on the evolution, in particular those relating to convection. We further demonstrate that not just the total mass loss, but the specific mass-loss history throughout a star's life is a crucial determinant of many aspects, such as the resulting stellar yields.
#### Formation of low mass protostars and their circumstellar disks

 - **Abstract**
 The birth process of circumstellar disks remains poorly constrained due to observational and numerical challenges. Recent numerical works have shown that the small-scale physics, often wrapped into a sub-grid model, play a crucial role in disk formation and evolution. This calls for a combined approach in which both the protostar and circumstellar disk are studied in concert. We aim to elucidate the small scale physics and constrain sub-grid parameters commonly chosen in the literature by resolving the star-disk interaction. We carry out a set of very high resolution 3D radiative-hydrodynamics simulations that self-consistently describe the collapse of a turbulent dense molecular cloud core to stellar densities. We study the birth of the protostar, the circumstellar disk, and its early evolution (< 6 yr after protostellar formation). Following the second gravitational collapse, the nascent protostar quickly reaches breakup velocity and sheds its surface material, thus forming a hot ($\sim 10^{3}$ K), dense, and highly flared circumstellar disk. The protostar is embedded within the disk, such that material can flow without crossing any shock fronts. The circumstellar disk mass quickly exceeds that of the protostar, and its kinematics are dominated by self-gravity. Accretion onto the disk is highly anisotropic, and accretion onto the protostar mainly occurs through material that slides on the disk surface. The polar mass flux is negligible in comparison. The radiative behavior also displays a strong anisotropy, as the polar accretion shock is shown to be supercritical whereas its equatorial counterpart is subcritical. We also find a remarkable convergence of our results with respect to initial conditions. These results reveal the structure and kinematics in the smallest spatial scales relevant to protostellar and circumstellar disk evolution.
#### The CO-to-H$_2$ Conversion Factor in the Barred Spiral Galaxy M83
 - **Authors:** Amanda M Lee, Jin Koda, Akihiko Hirota, Fumi Egusa, Mark Heyer

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14503
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14503
 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($\alpha_{\rm{CO}}$) in the nearby barred spiral galaxy M83. We present new HI observations from the JVLA and single-dish GBT in the disk of the galaxy, and combine them with maps of CO(1-0) integrated intensity and dust surface density from the literature. $\alpha_{\rm{CO}}$ and the gas-to-dust ratio ($\delta_{\rm{GDR}}$) are simultaneously derived in annuli of 2 kpc width from R = 1-7 kpc. We find that $\alpha_{\rm{CO}}$ and $\delta_{\rm{GDR}}$ both increase radially, by a factor of $\sim$ 2-3 from the center to the outskirts of the disk. The luminosity-weighted averages over the disk are $\alpha_{\rm{CO}} = 3.14$ (2.06, 4.96) M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$[K$\cdot$ km s$^{-1}$]$^{-1}$ and $\delta_{\rm{GDR}}$ = 137 (111, 182) at the 68% (1$\sigma$) confidence level. These are consistent with the $\alpha_{\rm{CO}}$ and $\delta_{\rm{GDR}}$ values measured in the Milky Way. In addition to possible variations of $\alpha_{\rm{CO}}$ due to the radial metallicity gradient, we test the possibility of variations in $\alpha_{\rm{CO}}$ due to changes in the underlying cloud populations, as a function of galactic radius. Using a truncated power-law molecular cloud CO luminosity function and an empirical power-law relation for cloud-mass and luminosity, we show that the changes in the underlying cloud population may account for a factor of $\sim 1.5-2.0$ radial change in $\alpha_{\rm{CO}}$.
#### Loss of coherence and change in emission physics for radio emission from  very inclined cosmic-ray air showers

 - **Abstract**
 Next-generation radio experiments such as the Radio Detector of the upgraded Pierre Auger Observatory and the planned GRAND and BEACON arrays target the detection of ultra-high-energy particle air showers arriving at low elevation angles. These inclined cosmic-ray air showers develop higher in the atmosphere than vertical ones, enhancing magnetic deflections of electrons and positrons inside the cascade. We evidence two novel features in their radio emission: a new polarization pattern, consistent with a geo-synchrotron emission model and a coherence loss of the radio emission, both for showers with zenith angle $\theta \gtrsim 65^{\circ}$ and strong enough magnetic field amplitude (typical strength of $B\sim 50\, \rm \mu T$). Our model is compared with both ZHAireS and CoREAS Monte-Carlo simulations. Our results break the cannonical description of a radio signal made of Askaryan and transverse current emission only, and provide guidelines for the detection and reconstruction strategies of next-generation experiments, including cosmic-ray/neutrino discrimination.
#### A Blueprint for the Milky Way's Stellar Populations. V. 3D Local Dust  Extinction

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14626
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14626
 - **Abstract**
 Using a grid of empirically calibrated synthetic spectra developed in our previous study, we construct an all-sky 3D extinction map from the large collection of low-resolution XP spectra in Gaia DR3. Along each line of sight, with an area ranging from $0.2$ to $13.4$ deg$^2$, we determine both the reddening and metallicity of main-sequence stars and model the foreground extinction up to approximately $3$ kpc from the Sun. Furthermore, we explore variations in the total-to-selective extinction ratio in our parameter search and identify its mean systematic change across diverse cloud environments in both hemispheres. In regions outside the densest parts of the clouds, our reddening estimates are validated through comparisons with previous reddening maps. However, a notable discrepancy arises in comparison to other independent work based on XP spectra, which can be attributed to systematic offsets in their metallicity estimates. On the other hand, our metallicity scale exhibits reasonable agreement with the high-resolution spectroscopic abundance scale. We also assess the accuracy of the XP spectra by applying our calibrated models, and we confirm an increasing trend of flux overestimation at shorter wavelengths below $400$ nm.

 - **Abstract**
 The next generation of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) is stepping into the era of microarcsecond ($\mu$as) astronomy, and pushing astronomy, especially astrometry, to new heights. VLBI with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), SKA-VLBI, will increase current sensitivity by an order of magnitude, and reach astrometric precision routinely below 10 $\mu$as, even challenging 1 $\mu$as. This advancement allows precise parallax and proper motion measurements of various celestial objects. Such improvements can be used to study objects (including isolated objects, and binary or multiple systems) in different stellar stages (such as star formation, main-sequence stars, asymptotic giant branch stars, pulsars, black holes, white dwarfs, etc.), unveil the structure and evolution of complex systems (such as the Milky Way), benchmark the international celestial reference frame, and reveal cosmic expansion. Furthermore, the theory of general relativity can also be tested with SKA-VLBI using precise measurements of light deflection under the gravitational fields of different solar system objects and the perihelion precession of solar system objects.
#### Isochrone Fitting of Galactic Globular Clusters -- VI. High-latitude  Clusters NGC5024 (M53), NGC5053, NGC5272 (M3), NGC5466, and NGC7099 (M30)

 - **Abstract**
 We fit various colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of the high-latitude Galactic globular clusters NGC\,5024 (M53), NGC\,5053, NGC\,5272 (M3), NGC\,5466, and NGC\,7099 (M30) by isochrones from the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database and Bag of Stellar Tracks and Isochrones for $\alpha$-enrichment [$\alpha$/Fe]$=+0.4$. For the CMDs, we use data sets from {\it Hubble Space Telescope}, {\it Gaia}, and other sources utilizing, at least, 25 photometric filters for each cluster. We obtain the following characteristics with their statistic uncertainties for NGC\,5024, NGC\,5053, NGC\,5272, NGC\,5466, and NGC\,7099, respectively: metallicities [Fe/H]$=-1.93\pm0.02$, $-2.08\pm0.03$, $-1.60\pm0.02$, $-1.95\pm0.02$, and $-2.07\pm0.04$ dex with their systematic uncertainty 0.1 dex; ages $13.00\pm0.11$, $12.70\pm0.11$, $11.63\pm0.07$, $12.15\pm0.11$, and $12.80\pm0.17$ Gyr with their systematic uncertainty 0.8 Gyr; distances (systematic uncertainty added) $18.22\pm0.06\pm0.60$, $16.99\pm0.06\pm0.56$, $10.08\pm0.04\pm0.33$, $15.59\pm0.03\pm0.51$, and $8.29\pm0.03\pm0.27$ kpc; reddenings $E(B-V)=0.023\pm0.004$, $0.017\pm0.004$, $0.023\pm0.004$, $0.023\pm0.003$, and $0.045\pm0.002$ mag with their systematic uncertainty 0.01 mag; extinctions $A_\mathrm{V}=0.08\pm0.01$, $0.06\pm0.01$, $0.08\pm0.01$, $0.08\pm0.01$, and $0.16\pm0.01$ mag with their systematic uncertainty 0.03 mag, which suggest the total Galactic extinction $A_\mathrm{V}=0.08$ across the whole Galactic dust to extragalactic objects at the North Galactic pole. The horizontal branch morphology difference of these clusters is explained by their different metallicity, age, mass-loss efficiency, and loss of low-mass members in the evolution of the core-collapse cluster NGC\,7099 and loose clusters NGC\,5053 and NGC\,5466.
#### Planetary nebula morphologies indicate a jet-driven explosion of SN  1987A and other core-collapse supernovae

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14843
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14843
 - **Abstract**
 I demonstrate the usage of planetary nebulae (PNe) to infer that a pair of jets shaped the ejecta of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) SN 1987A. The main structure of the SN 1987A inner ejecta, the keyhole, comprised two low-intensity zones. The northern one has a bright rim on its front, while the southern one has an elongated nozzle. Earlier comparison of the SN 1987A keyhole with bubbles in the galaxy group NGC 5813 led to its identification as a jet-shaped rim-nozzle structure. Here, I present rim-nozzle asymmetry in planetary nebulae (PNe), thought to be shaped by jets, which solidify the claim that jets powered the ejecta of SN 1987A and other CCSNe. This finding for the iconic SN 1987A with its unique properties strengthens the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of CCSNe. In a few hundred years, the CCSN 1987A will have a complicated structure with two main symmetry axes, one along the axis of the three circumstellar rings that two opposite 20,000-years pre-explosion jets shaped, and the other along the long axis of the keyhole that was shaped by the main jet pair of the exploding jets of SN 1987A in the frame of the JJEM.
#### X-ray detection of astrospheres around three main-sequence stars and  their mass-loss rates

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar winds of cool main sequence stars are very difficult to constrain observationally. One way to measure stellar mass loss rates is to detect soft X-ray emission from stellar astrospheres produced by charge exchange between heavy ions of the stellar wind and cold neutrals of the interstellar medium (ISM) surrounding the stars. Here we report detections of charge-exchange induced X-ray emission from the extended astrospheres of three main sequence stars, 70 Ophiuchi, epsilon Eridani, and 61 Cygni based on analysis of observations by XMM-Newton. We estimate the corresponding mass loss rates to be 66.5 +- 11.1, 15.6 +- 4.4, and 9.6 +- 4.1 times the solar mass loss rate for 70 Ophiuchi, epsilon Eridani, and 61 Cygni, respectively, and compare our results to the hydrogen wall method. We also place upper limits on the mass loss rates of several other main sequence stars. This method has potential utility for determining the mass loss rates from X-ray observations showing spatial extension beyond a coronal point source.
#### On the impact of the vertical structure of Martian water ice clouds on  nadir atmospheric retrievals from simultaneous EMM/EXI and TGO/ACS-MIR  observations

 - **Abstract**
 Retrieving the optical depth of the Martian clouds ($\tau_\mathrm{cld}$) is a powerful way to monitor their spatial and temporal evolution. However, such retrievals from nadir imagery rely on several assumptions, including the vertical structure of the clouds in the atmosphere. Here we compare the results of cloud optical depth retrievals from the Emirates eXploration Imager (EXI) onboard the Emirates Mars Mission (EMM) "Hope" orbiter performed using an empirical cloud profile (typically used in similar studies) and using derived cloud profiles obtained from near-simultaneous Solar Occultation observations from the Middle-Infrared channel of the Atmospheric Chemistry Suite (ACS) instrument onboard the ESA Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO). We show that the latitudinal dependence of the cloud vertical profiles can have a strong impact on the nadir retrievals; neglecting it can lead to a significant underestimation of $\tau_\mathrm{cld}$ in the polar regions (up to 25 %). We also discuss the impact of a vertically-dependent particle size profile, as previous studies have shown the presence of very small water ice particles at the top of the clouds. From this analysis, we provide recommendations for the improvement of water ice cloud parameterization in radiative transfer algorithms in nadir atmospheric retrievals.
#### A Unified Treatment of Kepler Occurrence to Trace Planet Evolution II:  The Radius Cliff Formed by Atmospheric Escape

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15172
 - **Abstract**
 The Kepler mission enabled us to look at the intrinsic population of exoplanets within our galaxy. In period-radius space, the distribution of the intrinsic population of planets contains structure that can trace planet formation and evolution history. The most distinctive feature in period-radius space is the radius cliff, a steep drop-off in occurrence between $2.5-4$R$_\oplus$ across all period ranges, separating the sub-Neptune population from the rarer Neptunes orbiting within 1 au. Following our earlier work to measure the occurrence rate of the Kepler population, we characterize the shape of the radius cliff as a function of orbital period ($10-300$ days) as well as insolation flux (9500S$_\oplus$ -- 10S$_\oplus$). The shape of the cliff flattens at longer orbital periods, tracking the rising population of Neptune-sized planets. In insolation, however, the radius cliff is both less dramatic and the slope is more uniform. The difference in this feature between period- and insolation-space can be linked to the effect of EUV/X-ray versus bolometric flux in the planet's evolution. Models of atmospheric mass loss processes that predict the location and shape of the radius valley also predict the radius cliff. We compare our measured occurrence rate distribution to population synthesis models of photoevaporation and core-powered mass-loss in order to constrain formation and evolution pathways. We find that the models do not statistically agree with our occurrence distributions of the radius cliff in period- or insolation-space. Atmospheric mass loss that shapes the radius valley cannot fully explain the shape of the radius cliff.
