 - **Abstract**
 Although neural-network-based emulators enable efficient parameter estimation in 21-cm cosmology, the accuracy of such constraints is poorly understood. We employ nested sampling to fit mock data of the global 21-cm signal and high-$z$ galaxy ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) and compare for the first time the emulated posteriors obtained using the global signal emulator ${\tt globalemu}$ to the `true' posteriors obtained using the full model on which the emulator is trained using ${\tt ARES}$. Of the eight model parameters we employ, four control the star formation efficiency (SFE), and thus can be constrained by UVLF data, while the remaining four control UV and X-ray photon production, and the minimum virial temperature of star-forming halos ($T_{\rm min}$), and thus are uniquely probed by reionization and 21-cm measurements. For noise levels of 50 and 250 mK in the 21-cm data being jointly-fit, the emulated and `true' posteriors are consistent to within $1\sigma$. However, at lower noise levels of 10 and 25 mK, ${\tt globalemu}$ overpredicts $T_{\rm min}$ and underpredicts $\gamma_{\rm lo}$, an SFE parameter, by $\approx3-4\sigma$, while the `true' ${\tt ARES}$ posteriors capture their fiducial values within $1\sigma$. We find that jointly-fitting the mock UVLF and 21-cm data significantly improves constraints on the SFE parameters by breaking degeneracies in the ${\tt ARES}$ parameter space. Our results demonstrate the astrophysical constraints that can be expected for global 21-cm experiments for a range of noise levels from pessimistic to optimistic, and also the potential for probing redshift evolution of SFE parameters by including UVLF data.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we treat Earth as an exoplanet and investigate our home planet by means of a potential future mid-infrared (MIR) space mission called the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE). We combine thermal spectra from an empirical dataset of disk-integrated Earth observations with a noise model for LIFE to create mock observations. We apply a state-of-the-art atmospheric retrieval framework to characterize the planet, assess the potential for detecting the known bioindicators, and investigate the impact of viewing geometry, seasonality, and patchy clouds on the characterization. Key findings include: (1) we are observing a temperate habitable planet with significant abundances of CO2, H2O, O3, and CH4; (2) seasonal variations in the surface and equilibrium temperature, and in the Bond albedo are detectable; (3) the viewing geometry and the spatially and temporally unresolved nature of our observations only have a minor impact on the characterization; (4) Earth's variable H2O profile and patchy cloud coverage lead to biased retrieval results for the atmospheric structure and trace gas abundances; (5) the limited extent of Earth's seasonal variations in biosignature abundances makes the direct detection of its biosphere through atmospheric seasonality unlikely. Our results suggest that LIFE could correctly identify Earth as a planet where life could thrive, with detectable levels of bioindicators, a temperate climate, and surface conditions allowing liquid surface water. Even if atmospheric seasonality is not easily observed, our study demonstrates that next generation, optimized space missions can assess whether nearby temperate terrestrial exoplanets are habitable or even inhabited.
#### The LoReLi database: 21 cm signal inference with 3D radiative  hydrodynamics simulations

 - **Abstract**
 The Square Kilometer array is expected to measure the 21cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization in the coming decade, and its pathfinders may provide a statistical detection even earlier. Current reported upper limits start putting constraints on the astrophysical parameters of the models of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). In order to interpret such data with 3D radiative hydrodynamics simulations using Bayesian inference, we present the latest developments of the Licorice code. Relying mainly on an implementation of the halo Conditional Mass Function to account for unresolved star formation, they allow for accurate simulations of the EoR at $256^3$ resolution. We use this version of Licorice to produce the first iteration of LoReLi, a public dataset now containing hundreds of 21cm signals computed from radiative hydrodynamics simulations. We train a neural network on LoReLi to provide a fast emulator of the Licorice powerspectra, LorEMU, that has $\sim 5\%$ rms error relative to the simulated signals. LorEMU is used in an MCMC framework to perform Bayesian inference, first on a mock observation composed of a simulated signal and a thermal noise corresponding to 100h observations with the SKA. We then apply our inference pipeline to the latest measurements from the HERA interferometer. We report constraints on the X-ray emissivity, and confirm that cold reionization scenarios are unlikely to accurately represent our Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We have created an up-to-date catalogue of 214 brown dwarfs (BDs) in binaries with $P < 10^4$ d. This allows us to examine the population statistics of the brown dwarf desert. We searched $\textit{Gaia}$ DR3 NSS results for orbital inclinations of BD candidates, deriving 12 new masses. Three remain as desert BDs whereas nine candidates are found to be low-mass stars. We improved the RV solutions for three previously studied BD candidates. A further 19 BD masses with periods less than $\sim$ 1200 d were identified in the DR3 $\texttt{binary_masses}$ database. We confirm a valley in the mass distribution with a minimum around 30-35 M$_{\textrm{jup}}$, and find that periods $<$ 100 d are still under-populated in comparison to longer periods. The updated mass and eccentricity distribution of BDs still shows a marginally statistically significant split into high- and low-mass BD populations. This hints at two different parent distributions, and two potential origins $-$ either akin to planetary formation, or stellar. There are no low eccentricity BDs at periods around 100 d. The mass-metallicity distribution of BDs indicates that core accretion is not the dominant formation mechanism for BDs as they do not follow the same trends that giant exoplanets do with metallicity. We identify a diagonal envelope bounding the Gaia BDs in the mass-period plane due to the detection thresholds of the currently available NSS solutions from 34 months of data.

 - **Abstract**
 Nearby associations are ideal regions to study coeval samples of protoplanetary and debris disks down to late M-type stars. Those aged 5-10,Myrs, where most of the disk should have already dissipated forming planets, are of particular interest. We present the first complete study of both protoplanetary and debris disks in a young region, using the $\eta$ Chamaeleontis association as a test bench to study the cold disk content. We obtained sub-millimeter data for the entire core population down to late M-type stars, plus a few halo members. We performed a continuum sub-millimeter survey with APEX/LABOCA of all the core populations of $\eta$ Cha association. Disk properties have been derived by modeling protoplanetary and debris disks using RADMC 2D and DMS, respectively. We find that protoplanetary disks in $\eta$ Cha typically have holes with radii of the order of 0.01 to 0.03 AU, while ring-like emission from the debris disks is located between 20 au and 650 au from the central star. The parallaxes and Gaia eDR3 photometry, in combination with the PARSEC and COLIBRI isochrones, enable us to confirm an age of $\eta$ Cha between 7 and 9 Myrs. In general, the disk mass seems insufficient to support accretion over a long time, even for the lowest mass accretors, a clear difference compared with other regions and also a sign that the mass budget is further underestimated. We do not find a correlation between the stellar masses, accretion rates, and disk masses, although this could be due to sample issues. We confirm that the presence of inner holes is not enough to stop accretion unless accompanied by dramatic changes to the total disk mass content. Comparing $\eta$ Cha with other regions at different ages, we find that the physical processes responsible for debris disks (e.g., dust growth, dust trapping) efficiently act in less than 5 Myrs.
#### A kinematic study of the disc-outflow system around a high-mass  protostar G59.783+0.065 probed by methanol and water masers

 - **Abstract**
 Class II CH3OH masers are used as a convenient tracer of disc-like structures in high-mass star formation. However, more than half of them show a complex distribution in Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) maps. The origin of such a complex distribution is still unknown. We conducted VLBI monitoring observations to unveil the origin of a complex class II CH3OH maser in the high-mass star-forming region G59.783+0.065. We observed the CH3OH maser at 6.7 GHz and the H2O maser at 22 GHz to probe detailed circumstellar kinematics and structures by the Japanese VLBI network and the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry. We found similar bipolar distributions in both masers, specifically two clusters located 2000 au apart along the East-West direction. We detected a linear distribution of CH3OH masers in the Western cluster. A position-velocity diagram shows that the Western CH3OH masers trace a rotating disc-wind or infalling component inside an edge-on disc-like structure. In contrast to the simple bipolar expanding motions of the H2O masers, the CH3OH masers exhibited complex motions despite their spatial coincidence. Some of the Eastern CH3OH masers showed bipolar expansions similar to the H2O masers, while others displayed random or even inward motions. Such complex kinematics and their close association with the H2O maser could occur at the boundary between outflow and inflow. We suggest that the complex distribution of class II CH3OH masers, like G59.783+0.065 arises from several distinct circumstellar structures that simultaneously achieve maser excitation.
#### X-rays from a Central "Exhaust Vent" of the Galactic Center Chimney

 - **Abstract**
 Using deep archival observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we present an analysis of linear X-ray-emitting features located within the southern portion of the Galactic center chimney, and oriented orthogonal to the Galactic plane, centered at coordinates l = 0.08 deg, b = -1.42 deg. The surface brightness and hardness ratio patterns are suggestive of a cylindrical morphology which may have been produced by a plasma outflow channel extending from the Galactic center. Our fits of the feature's spectra favor a complex two-component model consisting of thermal and recombining plasma components, possibly a sign of shock compression or heating of the interstellar medium by outflowing material. Assuming a recombining plasma scenario, we further estimate the cooling timescale of this plasma to be on the order of a few hundred to thousands of years, leading us to speculate that a sequence of accretion events onto the Galactic Black Hole may be a plausible quasi-continuous energy source to sustain the observed morphology.
