 - **Abstract**
 Extragalactic fast X-ray transients (FXTs) are short-duration ($\sim$ ks) X-ray flashes of unknown origin, potentially arising from binary neutron star mergers. We investigate the possible link between FXTs and the afterglows of off-axis merger-induced gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). By modelling the broadband afterglows of 13 GRBs, we make predictions for their X-ray light curve behaviour had they been observed off-axis, considering both a uniform jet with core angle $\theta_{C}$ and a Gaussian-structured jet with truncation angle $\theta_{W} = 2\theta_{C}$. We compare their peak X-ray luminosity, duration, and temporal indices with those of the currently known extragalactic FXTs. Our analysis reveals that a slightly off-axis observing angle of $\theta_{\text{obs}}\approx (2.2-3)\theta_{C}$ and a structured jet are required to explain the shallow temporal indices of the FXT light curves. In the case of a structured jet, the durations of the FXTs are consistent with those of the off-axis afterglows for the same range of observing angles, $\theta_{\text{obs}}\approx (2.2-3)\theta_{C}$. While the off-axis peak X-ray luminosities are consistent only for $\theta_{\text{obs}} = 2.2\theta_{C}$, focussing on individual events reveals that the match of all three properties of the FXTs at the same viewing angle is possible in the range $\theta_{\text{obs}} \sim (2.2-2.6)\theta_{C}$. Despite the small sample of GRBs analysed, these results show that there is a region of the parameter space - although quite limited - where the observational properties of off-axis GRB afterglows can be consistent with those of the newly discovered FXTs. Future observations of FXTs discovered by the recently launched Einstein Probe mission and GRB population studies combined with more complex afterglow models will shed light on this possible GRB-FXT connection, and eventually unveil the progenitors of some FXTs.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the rotational properties of inverted hybrid stars (also termed cross stars), which have been recently proposed as a possible new class of compact stars characterized by an outer layer of quark matter and a core of hadrons, in an inverted structure compared to traditional hybrid stars. We analyze distinct models representing varying depths of quark-hadron phase transitions. Our findings reveal that, while cross stars rotating at their Kepler frequencies typically exhibit a significantly higher mass and larger circumferential radius as anticipated, interestingly, there is a significant increase in potential twin configurations in the case of rapid rotations. We further study sequences of constant baryonic mass, representing potential paths of rotational evolution. Our results indicate that not all stars in these sequences are viable due to the onset of phase transitions during spin-down, leading to possible mini-collapses. We also investigate the phenomenon of ``back-bending" during spin-down sequences, which is manifested in a rather different shape for cross stars due to their inverted structure and the large density discontinuity caused by the strong phase transition, in contrast to traditional hybrid stars. Our research enriches existing studies by introducing the significant aspect of rotation, unveiling intr

 - **Abstract**
 Ice mantles play a crucial role in shaping the astrochemical inventory of molecules during star and planet formation. Small-scale molecular processes have a profound impact on large-scale astronomical evolution. The areas of solid-state laboratory astrophysics and computational chemistry study these processes. We review the laboratory effort on ice spectroscopy; methodological advances and challenges; and laboratory and computational studies of ice physics and ice chemistry. The latter we put in context with the ice evolution from clouds to disks. Three takeaway messages from this review are - Laboratory and computational studies allow interpretation of astronomical ice spectra in terms of identification, ice morphology and, local environmental conditions as well as the formation of the involved chemical compounds. - A detailed understanding of the underlying processes is needed to build reliable astrochemical models to make predictions on the abundances in space. - The relative importance of the different ice processes studied in the laboratory and computationally changes along the process of star and planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanets with masses between Earth and Neptune are amongst the most commonly observed, yet their properties are poorly constrained. Their transmission spectra are often featureless, which indicate either high-altitude clouds or a high atmospheric metallicity. The archetypical warm Neptune GJ 436b is such a planet showing a flat transmission spectrum in observations with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy (HRS) effectively probes exoplanet atmospheres at higher altitudes and can therefore be more sensitive to absorption coming from above potential cloud decks. In this paper we aim to investigate this for the exoplanet GJ 436b. We present new CRIRES+ HRS transit data of GJ 436b. Three transits were observed, but since two were during bad weather conditions, only one transit was analyzed. The radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS was used to create atmospheric models for cross-correlation and signal-injection purposes, including absorption from H$_2$O, CH$_4$, and CO. No transmission signals were detected, but atmospheric constraints can be derived. Injection of artificial transmission signals indicate that if GJ 436b would have a cloud deck at pressures P>10 mbar and a <300$\times$ solar metallicity, these CRIRES+ observations should have resulted in a detection. We estimate that the constraints presented here from one ground-based HRS transit are slightly better than those obtained with four HST transits. Combining HRS data from multiple transits is an interesting avenue for future studies of exoplanets with high-altitude clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 We constrain wind parameters of a sample of 18 O-type stars in the LMC, through analysis with stellar atmosphere and wind models including the effects of optically thick clumping. This allows us to determine the most accurate spectroscopic mass-loss and wind structure properties of massive stars at sub-solar metallicity to date and gain insight into the impact of metallicity on massive stellar winds. Combining high signal to noise (S/N) ratio spectroscopy in the UV and optical gives us access to diagnostics of multiple different physical processes in the stellar wind. We produce synthetic spectra using the stellar atmosphere modelling code FASTWIND, and reproduce the observed spectra using a genetic algorithm based fitting technique. We empirically constrain 15 physical parameters associated with the stellar and wind properties, including temperature, surface gravity, surface abundances, rotation, macroturbulence and wind parameters. We find, on average, mass-loss rates a factor of 4-5 lower than those predicted by Vink et al. 2001, in good agreement with predictions from Bjorklund et al. 2021, and the best agreement with those from Krticka et al. 2018. In the 'weak-wind' regime we find mass-loss rates orders of magnitude below any theoretical predictions. We find a positive correlation of clumping factors (fcl) with effective temperature with an average fcl = 14 +- 8 for the full sample. Above 38 kK an average 46 +- 24% of the wind velocity span is covered by clumps and the interclump density is 10-30% of the mean wind. Below an effective temperature of roughly 38 kK there must be additional light leakage for supergiants. For dwarf stars at low temperatures there is a statistical preference for very low clump velocity spans, however it is unclear if this can be physically motivated as there are no clearly observable wind signatures in UV diagnostics.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical complexity in low-metallicity hot cores has been confirmed by observations. We investigate the effect of varying physical parameters, such as temperature, density and the cosmic ray ionisation rate (CRIR), on the molecular abundance evolution in low-metallicity hot cores using the UMIST gas phase chemical model. CRIR had the strongest effect on molecular abundance. The resultant molecular abundances were divided into three categories with different trends in time evolution. We compared our results with the observations of hot cores in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Our model fits best with the observations at a time of around $10^5$ years after the evaporation of ice and at the CRIR of $1.36 \times 10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$. The resultant abundances of the oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (COMs), such as CH$_3$OH, HCOOCH$_3$ and CH$_3$OCH$_3$, do not fit with observations in the same physical condition and may be located in a different physical environment. Our results suggest that investigating the CRIR value is crucial to predict the molecular evolution in LMC hot cores.

 - **Abstract**
 Fragmentation contributes to the formation and evolution of stars. Observationally, high-mass stars are known to form multiple-star systems, preferentially in cluster environments. Theoretically, Jeans instability has been suggested to determine characteristic fragmentation scales, and thermal or turbulent motion in the parental gas clump mainly contributes to the instability. To search for such a characteristic fragmentation scale, we have analyzed ALMA 1.33 mm continuum observations toward 30 high-mass star-forming clumps taken by the Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA (DIHCA) survey. We have identified 573 cores using the dendrogram algorithm and measured the separation of cores by using the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) technique. The core separation corrected by projection effects has a distribution peaked around 5800 au. In order to remove biases produced by different distances and sensitivities, we further smooth the images to a common physical scale and perform completeness tests. Our careful analysis finds a characteristic fragmentation scale of $\sim$7000 au, comparable to the thermal Jeans length of the clumps. We conclude that thermal Jeans fragmentation plays a dominant role in determining the clump fragmentation in high-mass star-forming regions, without the need of invoking turbulent Jeans fragmentation.

 - **Abstract**
 Three-dimensional (3D) bubble structure of the Sgr-B molecular-cloud complex is derived by a kinematical analysis of CO-line archival cube data of the Galactic Centre (GC) observed with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. The line-of-sight depth is estimated by applying the face-on transformation method of radial velocity to the projected distance on the Galactic plane considering the Galactic rotation of the central molecular zone (CMZ). The 3D complex exhibits a conical-horn structure with the Sgr-B2 cloud located in the farthest end on the line of sight at radial velocity $v_{\rm lsr} \sim 70$ km s$^{-1}$, and the entire complex composes a lopsided bubble opening toward the Sun at $v_{\rm lsr}\sim 50$ to 30 km s$^{-1}$. The line-of-sight extent of the complex is $\sim 100$ pc according to the large velocity extent for several tens of km s$^{-1}$ from Sgr B2 to the outskirts. The entire complex exhibits a flattened conical bubble with full sizes $\sim 40 {\rm pc} \times 20 {\rm pc} \times 100 {\rm pc}$ in the $l$, $b$ and line-of-sight directions, respectively. Based on the 3D analysis, we propose a formation scenario of the giant molecular bubble structure due to a galactic bow shock, and suggest that the star formation in Sgr B2 was enhanced by dual-side compression of the B2 cloud by the Galactic shock wave from up-stream and expanding HII region from the down-stream side of the GC Arm I in Galactic rotation.
#### Pathways to Interstellar Amides via Carbamoyl (NH2CO) Isomers by Radical-Neutral Reactions on Ice Grain Mantles

 - **Abstract**
 Explaining the formation pathways of amides on ice-grain mantels is crucial to understanding the prebiotic chemistry in an interstellar medium. In this computational study, we explore different radical-neutral formation pathways for some of the observed amides (formamide, acetamide, urea, and N-methylformamide) via intermediate carbamoyl (NH2CO) radical precursors and their isomers. We assess the relative energy of four NH2CO isomers in the gas phase and evaluate their binding energy on small water clusters to discern the affinity that the isomers present to an ice model. We consider three possible reaction pathways for the formation of the carbamoyl radicals, namely, the OH + HCN, CN + H2O, and NH2 + CO reaction channels. We computed the binding energy distribution for the HCN and CH3CN precursors on an ice model consisting of a set of clusters of 22 water molecules each to serve as a starting point for the reactivity study on the ice surface. The computations revealed that the lowest barrier to the formation of an NH2CO isomer corresponds to the NH2 + CO reaction (12.6 kJ/mol). The OH + HCN reaction pathway results in the exothermic formation of the N-radical form of carbamoyl HN(C=O)H with a reaction barrier of 26.7 kJ/mol. We found that the CN + H2O reaction displays a high energy barrier of 70.6 kJ/mol. Finally, we also probed the direct formation of the acetamide radical precursor via the OH + CH3CN reaction and found that the most probable outcome on interstellar ices is the H-abstraction reaction to yield CH2CN and H2O. Based on these results, we believe that including alternative reaction pathways, leading to the formation of amides via the N-radical form of carbamoyl, would provide an improvement in the prediction of the amide abundances in astrochemical models, especially regarding the chemistry of star-forming regions.
