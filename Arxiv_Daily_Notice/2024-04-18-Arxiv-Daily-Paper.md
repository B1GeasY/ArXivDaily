 - **Abstract**
 We present the first degree-scale tomography map of the dusty magnetized interstellar medium (ISM) from stellar polarimetry and distance measurements. We used the RoboPol polarimeter at Skinakas Observatory to conduct a survey of starlight polarization in a region of the sky of 4 square degrees. We propose a Bayesian method to decompose the stellar-polarization source field along the distance to invert the 3D volume occupied by the observed stars. We used it to obtain the first 3D map of the dusty magnetized ISM. Specifically, we produced a tomography map of the orientation of the plane-of-sky (POS) component of the magnetic field threading the diffuse, dusty regions responsible for the stellar polarization. For the targeted region centered on Galactic coordinates $(l,b) \approx (103.3^\circ, 22.3^\circ)$, we identified several ISM clouds. Most of the lines of sight intersect more than one cloud. A very nearby component was detected in the foreground of a dominant component from which most of the polarization signal comes. Farther clouds, with a distance of up to 2~kpc, were similarly detected. Some of them likely correspond to intermediate-velocity clouds seen in HI spectra in this region of the sky. We found that the orientation of the POS component of the magnetic field changes along distance for most of the lines of sight. Our study demonstrates that starlight polarization data coupled to distance measures have the power to reveal the great complexity of the dusty magnetized ISM in 3D and, in particular, to provide local measurements of the POS component of the magnetic field. This demonstrates that the inversion of large data volumes, as expected from the PASIPHAE survey, will provide the necessary means to move forward in the modeling of the Galactic magnetic field and of the dusty magnetized ISM as a contaminant in observations of the cosmic microwave background polarization.

 - **Abstract**
 From the archival data of the BU-FCRAO $^{13}$ CO GRS, we measure the radial profiles of column density and turbulent velocity dispersion from the centers of molecular clouds outward into the surrounding diffuse molecular ISM. Averaged across spatial scales, the profiles are consistent with turbulence that is on average in hydrostatic equilibrium. We measure the turbulent kinetic energy (KE) and the gravitational potential energy (GE) within and the pressure energy (PE) outside the clouds. The distribution of the sum 2KE-|GE|-PE has a mean near zero indicating approximate virial equilibrium. The average pressure energy is consistent with estimates of the pressure of the multiphase ISM at the Galactic mid-plane. If the dynamical time scale of the turbulence scales with its crossing time, this apparent equilibrium may result from the rapid virialization of the KE and GE with respect to changes in PE. In a snapshot, the clouds appear to be in virial equilibrium within a confining pressure. However, the duration of the equilibrium is approximately the crossing time. An analysis of Larson's scaling relationships of line width and column density finds no correlation. Tthe inference of constant column density with cloud size is a misinterpretation of this lack of correlation.

 - **Abstract**
 Using 3D dust maps and Planck polarized dust emission data, we investigate the influence of the 3D geometry of the nearby interstellar medium (ISM) on the statistics of the dust polarization on large ($80'$) scales. We test the idea that the magnetic field in the nearby dust is preferentially tangential to the Local Bubble wall, but we do not find an imprint of the Local Bubble geometry on the dust polarization fraction. We also test the hypothesis that the complexity of the 3D dust distribution drives some of the measured variation of the dust polarization fraction. We compare sightlines with similar total column densities and find evidence that, on average, the dust polarization fraction decreases when the dust column is substantially distributed among multiple components at different distances. Conversely, the polarization fraction is higher for sightlines where the dust is more concentrated in 3D space. This finding is statistically significant for the dust within 1.25 kpc, but the effect disappears if we only consider dust within 270 pc. The extended 3D dust distribution, rather than solely the dust associated with the Local Bubble, plays a role in determining the observed dust polarization fraction on these scales. This conclusion is consistent with a simple analytical prediction and remains robust under various modifications to the analysis. These results illuminate the relationship between the 3D geometry of the ISM and tracers of the interstellar magnetic field. We also discuss implications for our understanding of the polarized dust foreground to the cosmic microwave background.

 - **Abstract**
 The TOI-421 planetary system contains two sub-Neptune-type planets and is a prime target to study the formation and evolution of planets and their atmospheres. The inner planet is especially interesting as the existence of a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere at its orbital separation cannot be explained by current formation models without previous orbital migration. We jointly analysed photometric data of three TESS sectors and six CHEOPS visits as well as 156 radial velocity data points to retrieve improved planetary parameters. We also searched for TTVs and modelled the interior structure of the planets. Finally, we simulated the evolution of the primordial H-He atmospheres of the planets using two different modelling frameworks. We determine the planetary radii and masses of TOI-421 b and c to be $R_{\rm b} = 2.64 \pm 0.08 \, R_{\oplus}$, $M_{\rm b} = 6.7 \pm 0.6 \, M_{\oplus}$, $R_{\rm c} = 5.09 \pm 0.07 \, R_{\oplus}$, and $M_{\rm c} = 14.1 \pm 1.4 \, M_{\oplus}$. We do not detect any statistically significant TTV signals. Assuming the presence of a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, the interior structure modelling results in both planets having extensive envelopes. While the modelling of the atmospheric evolution predicts for TOI-421 b to have lost any primordial atmosphere that it could have accreted at its current orbital position, TOI-421 c could have started out with an initial atmospheric mass fraction somewhere between 10 and 35%. We conclude that the low observed mean density of TOI-421 b can only be explained by either a bias in the measured planetary parameters (e.g. driven by high-altitude clouds) and/or in the context of orbital migration. We also find that the results of atmospheric evolution models are strongly dependent on the employed planetary structure model.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on ALMA ACA observations of a high-density region of the Corona Australis cloud forming a young star cluster, and the results of resolving internal structures. In addition to embedded Class 0/I protostars in continuum, a number of complex dense filamentary structures are detected in the C18O and SO lines by the 7m array. These are sub-structures of the molecular clump that are detected by the TP array as the extended emission. We identify 101 and 37 filamentary structures with a few thousand AU widths in C18O and SO, respectively, called as feathers. The typical column density of the feathers in C18O is about 10^{22} cm^{-2}, and the volume density and line mass are ~ 10^5 cm^{-3}, and a few times M_{sun} pc^{-1}, respectively. This line mass is significantly smaller than the critical line mass expected for cold and dense gas. These structures have complex velocity fields, indicating a turbulent internal property. The number of feathers associated with Class 0/I protostars is only ~ 10, indicating that most of them do not form stars but rather being transient structures. The formation of feathers can be interpreted as a result of colliding gas flow as the morphology well reproduced by MHD simulations, supported by the the presence of HI shells in the vicinity. The colliding gas flows may accumulate gas and form filaments and feathers, and trigger the active star formation of the R CrA cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 We present model-marginalized limits on the six standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters ($\Omega_{\rm c} h^2$, $\Omega_{\rm b} h^2$, $\theta_{\rm MC}$, $\tau_{\rm reio}$, $n_s$ and $A_s$), as well as on selected derived quantities ($H_0$, $\Omega_{\rm m}$, $\sigma_8$, $S_8$ and $r_{\rm drag}$), obtained by considering three independent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments: the Planck satellite, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and South Pole Telescope. We also consider low redshift observations in the form of Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from the SDSS-IV eBOSS survey and Supernovae (SN) distance moduli measurements from the Pantheon-Plus catalog. The marginalized errors are stable against the different fiducial cosmologies explored in this study. The largest impact on the parameter accuracy is produced by varying the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom ($N_{\rm eff}$) or the lensing amplitude ($A_{\rm lens}$). Nevertheless the marginalized errors on some derived parameters such as $H_0$ or $\Omega_{\rm m}$ can be up to two orders of magnitude larger than in the canonical $\Lambda$CDM scenario when considering only CMB data. In these cases, low redshift measurements are crucial for restoring the stability of the marginalized cosmological errors computed here. Overall, our results underscore remarkable stability in the mean values and precision of the main cosmological parameters, making irrelevant the choice of different possible cosmological scenarios once both high and low redshift probes are fully accounted for. The very same results should be understood as a tool to test exotic cosmological scenarios, as the marginalized values should be used in numerical analyses due to their robustness and slightly larger errors, providing a more realistic and conservative approach.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. High-resolution spectroscopy has the potential to drive a better understanding of the atmospheric composition, physics, and dynamics of young exoplanets and brown dwarfs, bringing clear insights into the formation channel of individual objects. Aims. Using the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC; R = 35,000), we aim to characterize a young brown dwarf HD 984 B. By measuring its C/O and 12CO/13CO ratios, we expect to gain new knowledge about its origin by confirming the difference in the formation pathways between brown dwarfs and super-Jupiters. Methods. We analysed the KPIC high-resolution spectrum (2.29-2.49 {\mu}m) of HD 984 B using an atmospheric retrieval framework based on nested sampling and petitRADTRANS, using both clear and cloudy models. Results. Using our best-fit model, we find C/O = 0.50+0.01-0.01 (0.01 is the statistical error) for HD 984 B which agrees with that of its host star within 1{\sigma} (0.40+0.20-0.20). We also retrieve an isotopolog 12CO/13CO ratio of 98+20-25 in its atmosphere, which is similar to that of the Sun. In addition, HD 984 B has a substellar metallicity with [Fe/H] = -0.62+0.02-0.02. Finally, we find that most of the retrieved parameters are independent of our choice of retrieval model. Conclusions. From our measured C/O and 12CO/13CO, the favored formation mechanism of HD 984 B seems to be via gravitational collapse or disk instability and not core accretion, which is a favored formation mechanism for giant exoplanets with m < 13 MJup and semimajor axis between 10 and 100 au. However, with only a few brown dwarfs with a measured 12CO/13CO ratio, similar analyses using high-resolution spectroscopy will become essential in order to determine planet formation processes more precisely.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon- and Oxygen-rich stars populating the Thermally-Pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch (TP-AGB) phase of stellar evolution are relevant contributors to the spectra of ~1 Gyr old populations. Atmosphere models for these types are uncertain, due to complex molecules and mass-loss effects. Empirical spectra are then crucial, but samples are small due to the short (~3 Myr) TP-AGB lifetime. Here we exploit the vastness of the MaNGA Stellar library MaStar (~60,000 spectra) to identify C,O-rich type stars. We define an optical colour selection with cuts of (g-r)>2 and (g-i)<1.55(g-r)-0.07, calibrated with known C- and O- rich spectra. This identifies C-,O-rich stars along clean, separated sequences. An analogue selection is found in V,R,I bands. Our equation identifies C- and O-rich spectra with predictive performance metric F1-scores of 0.72 and 0.74 (over 1), respectively. We finally identify 41 C- and 87 O-rich type AGB stars in MaStar, 5 and 49 of which do not have a SIMBAD counterpart. We also detect a sample of non-AGB, dwarf C-stars. We further design a fitting procedure to classify the spectra into broad spectral types, by using as fitting templates empirical C and O-rich spectra. We find remarkably good fits for the majority of candidates and categorise them into C- and O-rich bins following existing classifications, which correlate to effective temperature. Our selection models can be applied to large photometric surveys (e.g. Euclid, Rubin). The classified spectra will facilitate future evolutionary population synthesis models.
