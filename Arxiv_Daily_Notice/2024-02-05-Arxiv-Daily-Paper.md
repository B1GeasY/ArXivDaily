 - **Abstract**
 3C84 is a nearby radio source with a complex total intensity structure, showing linear polarisation and spectral patterns. A detailed investigation of the central engine region necessitates the use of VLBI above the hitherto available maximum frequency of 86GHz. Using ultrahigh resolution VLBI observations at the highest available frequency of 228GHz, we aim to directly detect compact structures and understand the physical conditions in the compact region of 3C84. We used EHT 228GHz observations and, given the limited (u,v)-coverage, applied geometric model fitting to the data. We also employed quasi-simultaneously observed, multi-frequency VLBI data for the source in order to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the core structure. We report the detection of a highly ordered, strong magnetic field around the central, SMBH of 3C84. The brightness temperature analysis suggests that the system is in equipartition. We determined a turnover frequency of $\nu_m=(113\pm4)$GHz, a corresponding synchrotron self-absorbed magnetic field of $B_{SSA}=(2.9\pm1.6)$G, and an equipartition magnetic field of $B_{eq}=(5.2\pm0.6)$G. Three components are resolved with the highest fractional polarisation detected for this object ($m_\textrm{net}=(17.0\pm3.9)$%). The positions of the components are compatible with those seen in low-frequency VLBI observations since 2017-2018. We report a steeply negative slope of the spectrum at 228GHz. We used these findings to test models of jet formation, propagation, and Faraday rotation in 3C84. The findings of our investigation into different flow geometries and black hole spins support an advection-dominated accretion flow in a magnetically arrested state around a rapidly rotating supermassive black hole as a model of the jet-launching system in the core of 3C84. However, systematic uncertainties due to the limited (u,v)-coverage, however, cannot be ignored.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a simple method for assessing the predictive performance of high-dimensional models directly in data space when only samples are available. Our approach is to compare the quantiles of observables predicted by a model to those of the observables themselves. In cases where the dimensionality of the observables is large (e.g. multiband galaxy photometry), we advocate that the comparison is made after projection onto a set of principal axes to reduce the dimensionality. We demonstrate our method on a series of two-dimensional examples. We then apply it to results from a state-of-the-art generative model for galaxy photometry (pop-cosmos) that generates predictions of colors and magnitudes by forward simulating from a 16-dimensional distribution of physical parameters represented by a score-based diffusion model. We validate the predictive performance of this model directly in a space of nine broadband colors. Although motivated by this specific example, the techniques we present will be broadly useful for evaluating the performance of flexible, non-parametric population models of this kind, and can be readily applied to any setting where two sets of samples are to be compared.

 - **Abstract**
 The Mg II h&k emission lines (2803, 2796 A) are a useful tool for understanding stellar chromospheres and transition regions due to their intrinsic brightness, relatively low interstellar medium (ISM) absorption interference, and abundance of archival spectra available. Similar to other optically thick chromospheric emission lines such as H I Lya, Mg II emissions commonly present with a self-reversed line core, the depth and shape of which vary from star to star. We explore the relationship between self-reversal and the stellar atmosphere by investigating the extent that fundamental stellar parameters affect self-reversal. We present a search for correlations between photospheric parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity with the Mg II k self-reversal depth for a group of 135 FGKM main sequence stars with high-resolution near-ultraviolet spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope. We modeled the observed MgII k line profiles to correct for ISM attenuation and recover the depth of emission line's self-reversal in relation to the intensity of the line. We used the PHOENIX atmosphere code to homogeneously determine the stellar parameters by computing a suite of stellar atmosphere models that include a chromosphere and transition region, and using archival photometry to guide the models of each star. We quantify the sensitivity of the visible and near-infrared photometry to chromospheric and photospheric parameters. We find weak trends between Mg II k self-reversal depth and age, rotation period, Mg II luminosity, temperature, and mass. All stars in our sample older than ~2 Gyr or rotating slower than ~10 days exhibit self-reversal.
#### Spatially Resolved Galactic Winds at Cosmic Noon: Outflow Kinematics and  Mass Loading in a Lensed Star-Forming Galaxy at $z=1.87$

 - **Abstract**
 We study the spatially resolved outflow properties of CSWA13, an intermediate mass ($M_*=10^{9}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), gravitationally lensed star-forming galaxy at $z=1.87$. We use Keck/KCWI to map outflows in multiple rest-frame ultraviolet ISM absorption lines, along with fluorescent Si II$^*$ emission, and nebular emission from C III] tracing the local systemic velocity. The spatial structure of outflow velocity mirrors that of the nebular kinematics, which we interpret to be a signature of a young galactic wind that is pressurizing the ISM of the galaxy but is yet to burst out. From the radial extent of Si II$^*$ emission, we estimate that the outflow is largely encapsulated within $3.5$ kpc. We explore the geometry (e.g., patchiness) of the outflow by measuring the covering fraction at different velocities, finding that the maximum covering fraction is at velocities $v\simeq-150$ km$\,$s$^{-1}$. Using the outflow velocity ($v_{out}$), radius ($R$), column density ($N$), and solid angle ($\Omega$) based on the covering fraction, we measure the mass loss rate $\log\dot{m}_{out}/(\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}) = 1.73\pm0.23$ and mass loading factor $\log\eta = 0.04\pm0.34$ for the low-ionization outflowing gas in this galaxy. These values are relatively large and the bulk of the outflowing gas is moving with speeds less than the escape velocity of the galaxy halo, suggesting that the majority of outflowing mass will remain in the circumgalactic medium and/or recycle back into the galaxy. The results support a picture of high outflow rates transporting mass and metals into the inner circumgalactic medium, providing the gas reservoir for future star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the serendipitous discovery of a large edge-on protoplanetary disk associated with the infrared source IRAS 23077+6707. The disk's apparent size in the Pan-STARRS (PS1) images is ~11", making this one of the largest known disks on the sky. It is likely a young system, still surrounded by the envelope which is very faint but still visible in the PS1 images in the northern part (alternatively this structure could be filaments from the disk itself). We use the PS1 magnitudes and other available photometric data to construct the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the disk. An optical spectrum indicates that the obscured star is hot, most likely late A. We adopt a distance of 300 pc for this object based on Gaia DR3 extinctions. We model the system using the HOCHUNK3D radiative transfer software and find that the system is consistent with a hot star of effective temperature 8000 K surrounded by a disk of size 1650 AU and mass 0.2 M_solar at inclination 82 degrees.
#### Patterns in water maser emission of evolved stars on the timescale of  decades

 - **Abstract**
 We present our past and current long-term monitoring program of water masers in the circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars, augmented by occasional interferometric observations. Using as example the Mira-variable U Her, we identify three types of variability: periodic (following the optical variation), long-term (years-decades) and short-term irregular (weeks-months). We show there are regions in the maser shell where excitation conditions are favourable, which remain stable for many years. Lifetimes of maser clouds in the wind-acceleration zone are of the order of up to a few years. Much longer lifetimes are found for the peculiar case of a maser cloud outside that zone (as in RT Vir), or in some cases where the motion of spectral features can be followed for the entire 2 decade monitoring period (as in red supergiant VX Sgr).
#### Doubly substituted isotopologues of HCCCN in TMC-1: Detection of  D13CCCN, DC13CCN, DCC13CN, DCCC15N, H13C13CCN, H13CC13CN, HC13C13CN,  HCC13C15N, and HC13CC15N

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detection in space of a complete sample of nine doubly substituted isotopologues of HCCCN towards the cyanopolyyne peak of TMC-1 using observations of the QUIJOTE line survey taken with the Yebes 40 m telescope. We detected D13CCCN, DC13CCN, DCC13CN, DCCC15N, H13C13CCN, H13CC13CN, HC13C13CN, HCC13C15N, and HC13CC15N through their J=4-3 and J=5-4 lines in the 7 mm window. In addition, we present an extensive analysis of the emission of HCCCN and its singly substituted isotopologues through a large velocity gradient model of the lines detected at 7 mm and 3 mm using the Yebes 40 m and the IRAM 30 m telescopes, respectively. The derived column densities for all the isotopologues are consistent in the two spectral bands for an H2 volume density of 1e4 cm-3 and a kinetic temperature of 10 K. Whereas we observed a 13C fractionation for HCC13CN and other double isotopologues with a 13C atom adjacent to the nitrogen atom, we derived similar C/13C abundance ratios for the three 13C substituted species of DCCCN. This suggests additional chemical discrimination for deuterated isotopologues of HCCCN. Finally, we present the spatial distribution of the J=4-3 and J=5-4 lines from the singly substituted species observed with the Yebes 40 m telescope. The emission peak of the spatial distribution of DCCCN appears to be displaced by 40'' with respect to that of HCCCN and the 13C and 15N isotopologues. In addition to a different formation route for the deuterated species, we could also expect that this differentiation owing to the deuterium fractionation is more efficient at low temperatures, and therefore, that deuterated species trace a colder region of the cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The model of disc fragmentation due to gravitational instabilities offers an alternate formation mechanism for gas giant planets, especially those on wide orbits. Aims. Our goal is to determine the 3D structure of disc-instability protoplanets and to examine how this relates to the thermal physics of the fragmentation process. Methods. We modelled the fragmentation of gravitationally unstable discs using the SPH code PHANTOM, and followed the evolution of the protoplanets formed through the first and second-hydrostatic core phases (up to densities 1e-3 g/cm3). Results. We find that the 3D structure of disc-instability protoplanets is affected by the disc environment and the formation history of each protoplanet (e.g. interactions with spiral arms, mergers). The large majority of the protoplanets that form in the simulations are oblate spheroids rather than spherical, and they accrete faster from their poles. Conclusions. The 3D structure of disc-instability protoplanets is expected to affect their observed properties and should be taken into account when interpreting observations of protoplanets embedded in their parent discs.
#### Non-resonant relaxation of rotating globular clusters

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01506
 - **Abstract**
 The long-term relaxation of rotating globular clusters is investigated through an extension of the orbit averaged Chandrasekhar non-resonant formalism. A comparison is made with the long-term evolution of the distribution function in action space, measured from averages of sets of $N$-body simulations up to core collapse. The impact of rotation on in-plane relaxation is found to be weak. In addition, we observe a clear match between theoretical predictions and $N$-body measurements. For the class of rotating models considered, we find no strong gravo-gyro catastrophe accelerating core collapse. Both kinetic theory and simulations predict a reshuffling of orbital inclinations from overpopulated regions to underpopulated ones. This trend accelerates as the amount of rotation is increased. Yet, for orbits closer to the rotational plane, the non-resonant prediction does not reproduce numerical measurements. We argue that this mismatch stems from these orbits' coherent interactions, which are not captured by the non-resonant formalism that only addresses local deflections.
#### Double Red Giant Branch and Red Clump features of Galactic disc stellar  populations with Gaia GSPspec

 - **Abstract**
 To disentangle the different competing physical processes at play in Galactic evolution, a detailed chrono chemicalkinematical, and dynamical characterisation of the disc bimodality is necessary, including high number statistics. Here we make use of an extremely precise subsample of the Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec catalogue of stellar chemophysical parameters. The selected database is composed of 408 800 stars with a median uncertainty of 10 K, 0.03 and 0.01 dex in Teff , log(g) and [M/H], respectively. The stellar parameter precision allows to break the age-metallicity degeneracy of disc stars. For the first time, the disc bimodality in the Kiel diagramme of giant stars is observed, getting rid of interstellar absortion issues. This bimodality produces double Red Giant Branch sequences and Red Clump features for mono-metallicity populations. A comparison with BaSTI isochrones allows to demonstrate that an age gap is needed to explain the evolutionary sequences separation, in agreement with previous age-metallicity relations obtained using Main-Sequence Turn Off stars. A bimodal distribution in the stellar mass-[alpha/Fe] plane is observed at constant metallicity. Finally, a selection of stars with [M/H]=0.45 \pm 0.03 dex shows that the most metal-rich population in the Milky Way disc presents an important proportion of stars with ages in the range 5-13 Gyr. This old, extremely metal-rich population is possibly a mix of migrated stars from the internal Galactic regions, and old disc stars formed before the last major merger of the Milky Way. The Gaia GSP-Spec Kiel diagrammes of disc mono-abundance stellar populations reveal a complex, non linear age-metallicity relation crafted by internal and external processes of Galactic evolution. Their detailed analysis opens new opportunities to reconstruct the puzzle of the Milky Way disc bimodality.
#### Convergence Tests of Self-Interacting Dark Matter Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) theory predicts that dark matter halos experience core-collapse, a process where the halo's inner region rapidly increases in density and decreases in size. The N-body simulations used to study this process can suffer from numerical errors when simulation parameters are selected incorrectly. Optimal choices for simulation parameters are well studied for cold dark matter (CDM), but are not deeply understood when self-interactions are included. In order to perform reliable N-body simulations and model core-collapse accurately we must understand the potential numerical errors, how to diagnose them, and what parameter selections must be made to reduce them. We use the $\texttt{Arepo}$ N-body code to perform convergence tests of core-collapsing SIDM halos across a range of halo concentrations and SIDM cross-sections, and quantify potential numerical issues related to mass resolution, timestep size, and gravitational softening length. Our tests discover that halos with fewer than $10^5$ simulation particles, a resolution typically not met by subhalos in N-body simulations, suffer from significant discreteness noise that leads to variation and extreme outliers in the collapse rate. At our lowest resolution of $N=10^4$ particles, this collapse time variation can reach as high as 20%. At this low resolution we also find a bias in collapse times and a small number of extreme outliers. Additionally, we find that simulations which run far beyond the age of the Universe, which have been used to calibrate SIDM gravothermal fluid models in previous work, have a sensitivity to the timestep size that is not present in shorter simulations or simulations using only CDM. Our work shows that choices of simulation parameters that yield converged results for some halo masses and SIDM models do not necessarily yield convergence for others.
