 - **Abstract**
 In observational studies of infrared dark clouds, the number of detections of CO freeze-out onto dust grains (CO depletion) at pc-scale is extremely limited, and the conditions for its occurrence are, therefore, still unknown. We report a new object where pc-scale CO depletion is expected. As a part of Kagoshima Galactic Object survey with Nobeyama 45-m telescope by Mapping in Ammonia lines (KAGONMA), we have made mapping observations of NH3 inversion transition lines towards the star-forming region associated with the CMa OB1 including IRAS 07077-1026, IRAS 07081-1028, and PGCC G224.28-0.82. By comparing the spatial distributions of the NH3 (1,1) and C18O (J=1-0), an intensity anti-correlation was found in IRAS 07077-1026 and IRAS 07081-1028 on the ~1 pc scale. Furthermore, we obtained a lower abundance of C18O at least in IRAS 07077-1026 than in the other parts of the star-forming region. After examining high density gas dissipation, photodissociation, and CO depletion, we concluded that the intensity anti-correlation in IRAS 07077-1026 is due to CO depletion. On the other hand, in the vicinity of the centre of PGCC G224.28-0.82, the emission line intensities of both the NH3 (1,1) and C18O (J=1-0) were strongly detected, although the gas temperature and density were similar to IRAS 07077-1026. This indicates that there are situations where C18O (J=1-0) cannot trace dense gas on the pc scale and implies that the conditional differences that C18O (J=1-0) can and cannot trace dense gas are unclear.
#### Mapping the core of the Tarantula Nebula with VLT-MUSE. III. A template  for metal-poor starburst regions in the visual and far-ultraviolet

 - **Abstract**
 We present the integrated VLT-MUSE spectrum of the central 2'x2' (30x30 pc$^{2}$) of NGC 2070, the dominant giant HII region of the Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud, together withan empirical far-ultraviolet spectrum constructed via LMC template stars from the ULLYSES survey and Hubble Tarantula Treasury Project UV photometry. NGC 2070 provides a unique opportunity to compare results from individual stellar populations (e.g. VLT FLAMES Tarantula Survey) in a metal-poor starburst region to the integrated results from the population synthesis tools Starburst99, Charlot & Bruzual and BPASS. The metallicity of NGC 2070 inferred from standard nebular strong line calibrations is 0.4$\pm$0.1 dex lower than obtained from direct methods. The Halpha inferred age of 4.2 Myr from Starburst99 is close to the median age of OB stars within the region, although individual stars span a broad range of 1-7 Myr. The inferred stellar mass is close to that obtained for the rich star cluster R136 within NGC 2070, although this contributes only 21% to the integrated far-UV continuum. HeII 1640 emission is dominated by classical WR stars and main sequence WNh+Of/WN stars. 18% of the NGC~2070 far UV continuum flux arises from very massive stars with >100 Msun, including several very luminous Of supergiants. None of the predicted population synthesis models at low metallicities are able to successfully reproduce the far-UV spectrum of NGC 2070. We attribute issues to the treatment of mass-loss in very massive stars, the lack of contemporary empirical metal-poor templates, plus WR stars produced via binary evolution.
#### JWST imaging of edge-on protoplanetary disks II. Appearance of edge-on  disks with a tilted inner region: case study of IRAS04302+2247

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST imaging from 2$\mu$m to 21$\mu$m of the edge-on protoplanetary disk around the embedded young star IRAS04302+2247. The structure of the source shows two reflection nebulae separated by a dark lane. The source extent is dominated by the extended filamentary envelope at $\sim$4.4$\mu$m and shorter wavelengths, transitioning at 7$\mu$m and longer wavelengths to more compact lobes of scattered light from the disk itself. The dark lane thickness does not vary significantly with wavelength, which we interpret as an indication for intermediate-sized ($\sim10\mu$m) grains in the upper layers of the disk. Intriguingly, we find that the brightest nebula of IRAS40302 switches side between 12.8$\mu$m and 21$\mu$m. We explore the effect of a tilted inner region on the general appearance of edge-on disks. We find that radiative transfer models of a disk including a tilted inner region can reproduce an inversion in the brightest nebula. In addition, for specific orientations, the model also predicts strong lateral asymmetries, which can occur for more than half possible viewing azimuths. A large number of edge-on protoplanetary disks observed in scattered light show such lateral asymmetries (15/20), which suggests that a large fraction of protoplanetary disks might host a tilted inner region. Stellar spots may also induce lateral asymmetries, which are expected to vary over a significantly shorter timescale. Variability studies of edge-on disks would allow to test the dominant scenario for the origin of these asymmetries.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the key research themes identified by the Astro2020 decadal survey is Worlds and Suns in Context. The Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS) is a proposed NASA APEX mission that will become the prime high-energy instrument for studying star-planet connections from birth to death. This work explores the major advances in this broad domain of research that will be enabled by the AXIS mission, through X-ray observations of stars in clusters spanning a broad range of ages, flaring M-dwarf stars known to host exoplanets, and young stars exhibiting accretion interactions with their protoplanetary disks. In addition, we explore the ability of AXIS to use planetary nebulae, white dwarfs, and the Solar System to constrain important physical processes from the microscopic (e.g., charge exchange) to the macroscopic (e.g., stellar wind interactions with the surrounding interstellar medium).
#### Critique of arXiv submission 2308.15623, "Discovery of Spherules of  Likely Extrasolar Composition in the Pacific Ocean Site of the CNEOS  2014-01-08 (IM1) Bolide", by A. Loeb et al

 - **Abstract**
 Recently a manuscript by Loeb et al. was uploaded to arXiv (preprint 2308.15623) that asserted that the CNEOS bolide 2014-01-08 was interstellar; that spherules recovered from the seafloor near the airburst were associated with this bolide; that they had Fe isotopic ratios indicating origin as micrometeorites; that they had unusual chemical compositions enriched in Be, La and U, never seen before in micrometeorite spherules; that these compositions were formed in the magma ocean stage of a differentiated extrasolar planet; and that the Be abundance reflected passage through the interstellar medium. Despite not being peer-reviewed, this uploaded manuscript has been reported by media outlets as "published", and its conclusions have been widely distributed as fact. The purpose of this manuscript is to provide potential peer reviewers and the general public with an appreciation of the multiple fatal flaws with the manuscript's arguments. We discuss the published evidence that the 2014-01-08 bolide is not interstellar. We show that there is no statistical spatial correlation of a chemical signature or even number of recovered spherules with the 2014-01-08 bolide. We demonstrate that the Fe isotopic ratios decisively indicate an origin in our Solar System, with > 99.995% probability. We demonstrate that the unusual enrichments in La, U, etc., have in fact been observed in micrometeorites before and attributed to terrestrial contamination; and that the Be abundances are similarly consistent with those of ferromanganese nodules, after reacting with sea water. Far from being exotic particles from an extrasolar planet, the spherules collected and analyzed by Loeb et al. appear to be just like those found around the world, with a Solar System origin and compositions modified by tens of thousands of years residence at the ocean bottom.

 - **Abstract**
 A proposed setting for thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae is a white dwarf that has gained mass from a companion to the point of carbon ignition in the core. There is a simmering phase in the early stages of burning that involves the formation and growth of a core convection zone. One aspect of this phase is the convective Urca process, a linking of weak nuclear reactions to convection that may alter the composition and structure of the white dwarf. Convective Urca is not well understood and requires 3D fluid simulations to realistically model. Additionally, the convection is relatively slow (Mach number less than 0.005) so a low-Mach method is needed to make simulating computationally feasible. Using the MAESTROeX low-Mach hydrodynamics code, we investigate recent changes to how the weak reactions are modeled in the convective Urca simulations. We present results that quantify the changes to the reaction rates and their impact on the evolution of the simulation.
#### The formation of blue large-amplitude pulsators from white-dwarf  main-sequence star mergers

 - **Abstract**
 Blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) are hot low-mass stars which show large-amplitude light variations likely due to radial oscillations driven by iron-group opacities. Period changes provide evidence of both secular contraction and expansion amongst the class. Various formation histories have been proposed, but none are completely satisfactory. \citet{Zhang2017} proposed that the merger of a helium core white dwarf with a low-mass main-sequence star (HeWD+MS) can lead to the formation of some classes of hot subdwarf. We have analyzed these HeWD+MS merger models in more detail. Between helium-shell ignition and full helium-core burning, the models pass through the volume of luminosity -- gravity-- temperature space occupied by BLAPs. Periods of expansion and contraction associated with helium-shell flashes can account for the observed rates of period change. We argue that the HeWD+MS merger model provides at least one BLAP formation channel.

 - **Abstract**
 We determine the ortho/para ratios of NH2D and NHD2 in two dense, starless cores, where their formation is supposed to be dominated by gas-phase reactions, which, in turn, is predicted to result in deviations from the statistical spin ratios. The Large APEX sub-Millimeter Array (LAsMA) multibeam receiver of the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) telescope was used to observe the prestellar cores H-MM1 and Oph D in Ophiuchus in the ground-state lines of ortho and para NH2D and NHD2. The fractional abundances of these molecules were derived employing 3D radiative transfer modelling, using different assumptions about the abundance profiles as functions of density. We also ran gas-grain chemistry models with different scenarios concerning proton or deuteron exchanges and chemical desorption from grains to find out if one of these models can reproduce the observed spin ratios. The observationally deduced ortho/para ratios of NH2D and NHD2 are in both cores within 10% of their statistical values 3 and 2, respectively, and taking 3-sigma limits, deviations from these of about 20% are allowed. Of the chemistry models tested here, the model that assumes proton hop (as opposed to full scrambling) in reactions contributing to ammonia formation, and a constant efficiency of chemical desorption, comes nearest to the observed abundances and spin ratios. The nuclear spin ratios derived here are in contrast with spin-state chemistry models that assume full scrambling in proton donation and hydrogen abstraction reactions leading to deuterated ammonia. The efficiency of chemical desorption influences strongly the predicted abundances of NH3, NH2D, and NHD2, but has a lesser effect on their ortho/para ratios. For these the proton exchange scenario in the gas is decisive. We suggest that this is because of rapid re-processing of ammonia and related cations by gas-phase ion-molecule reactions.
#### The Gaia-ESO Survey: 3D dynamics of young groups and clusters from GES  and Gaia EDR3

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first large-scale 3D kinematic study of ~2000 spectroscopically-confirmed young stars (<20 Myr) in 18 star clusters and OB associations (hereafter groups) from the combination of Gaia astrometry and Gaia-ESO Survey spectroscopy. We measure 3D velocity dispersions for all groups, which range from 0.61 to 7.4 km/s (1D velocity dispersions of 0.35 to 4.3 km/s). We find the majority of groups have anisotropic velocity dispersions, suggesting they are not dynamically relaxed. From the 3D velocity dispersions, measured radii and estimates of total mass we estimate the virial state and find that all systems are super-virial when only the stellar mass is considered, but that some systems are sub-virial when the mass of the molecular cloud is taken into account. We observe an approximately linear correlation between the 3D velocity dispersion and the group mass, which would imply that the virial state of groups scales as the square root of the group mass. However, we do not observe a strong correlation between virial state and group mass. In agreement with their virial state we find that nearly all of the groups studied are in the process of expanding and that the expansion is anisotropic, implying that groups were not spherical prior to expansion. One group, Rho Oph, is found to be contracting and in a sub-virial state (when the mass of the surrounding molecular cloud is considered). This work provides a glimpse of the potential of the combination of Gaia and data from the next generation of spectroscopic surveys.
#### Evaporation Ages: a New Dating Method for Young Star Clusters

 - **Abstract**
 The ages of young star clusters are fundamental clocks to constrain the formation and evolution of pre-main-sequence stars and their protoplanetary disks and exoplanets. However, dating methods for very young clusters often disagree, casting doubts on the accuracy of the derived ages. We propose a new method to derive the kinematic age of star clusters based on the evaporation ages of their stars. The method is validated and calibrated using hundreds of clusters identified in a supernova-driven simulation of the interstellar medium forming stars for approximately 40 Myr within a 250 pc region. We demonstrate that the clusters' evaporation-age uncertainty can be as small as about 10% for clusters with a large enough number of evaporated stars and small but realistic observational errors. We have obtained evaporation ages for a pilot sample of 10 clusters, finding a good agreement with their published isochronal ages. The evaporation ages will provide important constraints for modeling the pre-main-sequence evolution of low-mass stars, as well as to investigate the star-formation and gas-evaporation history of young clusters. These ages can be more accurate than isochronal ages for very young clusters, for which observations and models are more uncertain.
