 - **Abstract**
 We introduce SigNova, a new semi-supervised framework for detecting anomalies in streamed data. While our initial examples focus on detecting radio-frequency interference (RFI) in digitized signals within the field of radio astronomy, it is important to note that SigNova's applicability extends to any type of streamed data. The framework comprises three primary components. Firstly, we use the signature transform to extract a canonical collection of summary statistics from observational sequences. This allows us to represent variable-length visibility samples as finite-dimensional feature vectors. Secondly, each feature vector is assigned a novelty score, calculated as the Mahalanobis distance to its nearest neighbor in an RFI-free training set. By thresholding these scores we identify observation ranges that deviate from the expected behavior of RFI-free visibility samples without relying on stringent distributional assumptions. Thirdly, we integrate this anomaly detector with Pysegments, a segmentation algorithm, to localize consecutive observations contaminated with RFI, if any. This approach provides a compelling alternative to classical windowing techniques commonly used for RFI detection. Importantly, the complexity of our algorithm depends on the RFI pattern rather than on the size of the observation window. We demonstrate how SigNova improves the detection of various types of RFI (e.g., broadband and narrowband) in time-frequency visibility data. We validate our framework on the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) telescope and simulated data and the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA).

 - **Abstract**
 This study probes the chemical abundances of the neutron-capture elements cerium and neodymium in the inner Milky Way from an analysis of a sample of $\sim$2000 stars in the Galactic Bulge/bar spatially contained within $|X_{Gal}|<$5 kpc, $|Y_{Gal}|<$3.5 kpc, and $|Z_{Gal}|<$1 kpc, and spanning metallicities between $-$2.0$\lesssim$[Fe/H]$\lesssim$+0.5. We classify the sample stars into low- or high-[Mg/Fe] populations and find that, in general, values of [Ce/Fe] and [Nd/Fe] increase as the metallicity decreases for the low- and high-[Mg/Fe] populations. Ce abundances show a more complex variation across the metallicity range of our Bulge-bar sample when compared to Nd, with the r-process dominating the production of neutron-capture elements in the high-[Mg/Fe] population ([Ce/Nd]$<$0.0). We find a spatial chemical dependence of Ce and Nd abundances for our sample of Bulge-bar stars, with low- and high-[Mg/Fe] populations displaying a distinct abundance distribution. In the region close to the center of the MW, the low-[Mg/Fe] population is dominated by stars with low [Ce/Fe], [Ce/Mg], [Nd/Mg], [Nd/Fe], and [Ce/Nd] ratios. The low [Ce/Nd] ratio indicates a significant contribution in this central region from r-process yields for the low-[Mg/Fe] population. The chemical pattern of the most metal-poor stars in our sample suggests an early chemical enrichment of the Bulge dominated by yields from core-collapse supernovae and r-process astrophysical sites, such as magneto-rotational supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 This review highlights the role of the \textit{Gaia} space mission in transforming white dwarf research. These stellar remnants constitute 5-7\% of the local stellar population in volume, yet before \textit{Gaia} the lack of trigonometric parallaxes hindered their identification. The mission's Data Release 2 in 2018 provided the first unbiased colour-absolute magnitude diagram of the local stellar population, identifying 260\,000 white dwarfs, with the number later increasing to over 355\,000 in Data Release 3. Since then, more than 400 white dwarf studies have made critical use of \textit{Gaia} data, establishing it as a fundamental resource for white dwarf identification, fundamental parameter determination and more recently spectral type characterisation. The review underscores the routine reliance on \textit{Gaia} parallaxes and extensive use of its photometry in white dwarf surveys. We also discuss recent discoveries firmly grounded \textit{Gaia} data, including white dwarf mergers, exotic compact binaries and evolved planetary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-wavelength photometry of brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects provides insight into their atmospheres and cloud layers. We present near-simultaneous $J-$ and $K_s-$band multi-wavelength observations of the highly variable T2.5 planetary-mass object, SIMP J013656.5+093347. We reanalyze observations acquired over a single night in 2015 using a recently developed data reduction pipeline. For the first time, we detect a phase shift between $J-$ and $K_s-$band light curves, which we measure to be $39.9^{\circ +3.6}_{ -1.1}$. Previously, phase shifts between near-infrared and mid-infrared observations of this object were detected and attributed to probing different depths of the atmosphere, and thus different cloud layers. Using the Sonora Bobcat models, we expand on this idea to show that at least two different patchy cloud layers must be present to explain the measured phase shift. Our results are generally consistent with recent atmospheric retrievals of this object and other similar L/T transition objects.
#### ALMA-IMF XI: The sample of hot core candidates A rich population of  young high-mass proto-stars unveiled by the emission of methyl formate

 - **Abstract**
 Sites associated with high-mass star and cluster formation exhibit a so-called hot core phase, characterized by high temperatures and column densities of complex organic molecules. We built a comprehensive census of hot core candidates towards the ALMA-IMF protoclusters based on the detection of two CH3OCHO emission lines at 216.1 GHz. We used the source extraction algorithm GExt2D to identify peaks of methyl formate (CH3OCHO) emission that is a complex species commonly observed towards sites of star formation. We built up a catalog of 76 hot core candidates with masses ranging from about 0.2 to 80 Msun , of which 56 are new detections. A large majority of these objects are compact, rather circular, with deconvolved FWHM sizes of about 2300 au on average. About 30% of our sample of methyl formate sources have core masses above 8 Msun within sizes ranging from about 1000 au to 13400 au, which well correspond to archetypical hot cores. The origin of the CH3OCHO emission toward the lower-mass cores can be explained by a mixture of contribution from shocks, or may correspond to objects in a more evolved state, i.e. beyond the hot core stage. We find that the fraction of hot core candidates increases with the core mass. The large fraction of hot core candidates towards the most massive cores suggests that they rapidly enter the hot core phase and feedback effects from the forming protostar(s) impact their environment on short time-scales.
#### Magnetic Field at the Galactic Centre from Multi-Wavelength Dust  Polarization

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15098
 - **Abstract**
 We have mapped the magnetic field ($B$-field) for a region of about 30 pc around the centre of our Galaxy, which encompasses the circumnuclear disk (CND), the mini-spirals, and the 20 km s$^{-1}$ and 50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular clouds, using thermal dust polarization observations obtained from SOFIA/HAWC+ and JCMT/SCUPOL. We decompose the spectra of $^{12}$CO ($J=3\rightarrow2$) transition from this region into individual clustered cloud components and find the polarization observed at different wavelengths might be tracing completely different layers of dust along the line-of-sight (LOS). We use modified Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi methods to estimate the $B$-field from the observations. From our analysis we find the mean strength of the plane-of-sky $B$-field ($B_{{}_{\mathrm{POS}}}$) of the CND and the mini-spirals, probed at 53 $\mu$m to be of the order of $\sim2$ mG. The magnetic field is lowest close to the Galactic Centre, in the region of the ionized mini-cavity within the CND with $B_{{}_{\mathrm{POS}}}<1$ mG, and increases outwards. However, the longer wavelength polarization at 216 $\mu$m appears to come from a dust layer that is cooler and behind the CND and has a stronger $B$-field of about 6 mG. The $B$-field has the least strength along the Eastern Arm of the mini-spiral, which is also the only region with $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{A}}>1$ and a mass-to-flux ratio of $\lambda\gtrsim1$. The similarity between the $B_{{}_{\mathrm{POS}}}$ estimates of the 53 $\mu$m and 850 $\mu$m observations might indicate them originating from the same depth along the LOS, mostly from the CND and its foreground cloud features, including the negative-longitude extension.
#### On a precessing jet-nozzle scenario with a common helical  trajectory-pattern for blazar 3C345

 - **Abstract**
 The kinematics and flux evolution of the superluminal knots in blazar 3C345 were interpreted in the framework of the precessing jet-nozzle scenario with a precessing common helical trajectory-pattern. We show that the jet in 3C345 precesses with a period of 7.3yr and the superluminal knots move consistently along a precessing common helical trajectory-pattern in their inner jet regions, which can extend to core distances of about 1.2mas or traveled distances of about 300pc (for knots C4 and C9). Through model-fitting of the observed kinematic behavior of the superluminal knots, their bulk Lorentz factor and Doppler factor were derived as continuous functions of time, which were used to investigate their flux evolution. We found that the light curves measured at 15, 22 and 43GHz can be well model-fitted in terms of their Doppler boosting profiles associated with their superluminal motion. Flux fluctuations on shorter time scales also exist due to knots' intrinsic variations in flux density and spectral index. The close association of the flux evolution with the Doppler boosting effect is important, firmly vadidating the precessing jet-nozzle scenario being fully appropriate to explain both the kinematics and emission properties of the superluminal knots in 3C345. We have proposed both the precessing jet-nozzle scenarios with a single jet and double jets (this paper and Qian[2022b]) to understand the VLBI phenomena in 3C345. VLBI-observations with higher resolutions deep into the core regions (core distances less than 0.1mas) are required to test them.
#### Classification of compact radio sources in the Galactic plane with  supervised machine learning

 - **Abstract**
 Generation of science-ready data from processed data products is one of the major challenges in next-generation radio continuum surveys with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and its precursors, due to the expected data volume and the need to achieve a high degree of automated processing. Source extraction, characterization, and classification are the major stages involved in this process. In this work we focus on the classification of compact radio sources in the Galactic plane using both radio and infrared images as inputs. To this aim, we produced a curated dataset of ~20,000 images of compact sources of different astronomical classes, obtained from past radio and infrared surveys, and novel radio data from pilot surveys carried out with the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP). Radio spectral index information was also obtained for a subset of the data. We then trained two different classifiers on the produced dataset. The first model uses gradient-boosted decision trees and is trained on a set of pre-computed features derived from the data, which include radio-infrared colour indices and the radio spectral index. The second model is trained directly on multi-channel images, employing convolutional neural networks. Using a completely supervised procedure, we obtained a high classification accuracy (F1-score>90%) for separating Galactic objects from the extragalactic background. Individual class discrimination performances, ranging from 60% to 75%, increased by 10% when adding far-infrared and spectral index information, with extragalactic objects, PNe and HII regions identified with higher accuracies. The implemented tools and trained models were publicly released, and made available to the radioastronomical community for future application on new radio data.
#### Updated kinematics of the Radcliffe Wave: non-synchronous, dipole-like  vertical oscillations

 - **Abstract**
 The kinematic structure of the Radcliffe Wave (RW) is crucial for understanding its origin and evolution. In this work, we present an accurate measurement of the vertical velocity $V_Z$ by where the radial velocity (RV) measures are taken into consideration. This is achieved in two ways. First, the velocities are measured towards Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), using their RV and proper motion measurements from APOGEE-2 and Gaia DR3. Second, we combine RV measurements toward clouds with proper motion measurements of associated YSOs to determine the vertical velocities of the clouds. The results reveal that the oscillations in $V_Z$ are not synchronous with the vertical coordinate. The difference is caused by a combination of the effect of the radial velocity which we include in this paper, and the difference in models. By supplementing our analysis with additional young star samples, we find a consistent dipole pattern in $V_Z$. The fact that no significant amplitude differences are found among the analyzed samples indicates that there is no apparent age gradient within the dipole. We propose that RW evolves at a relatively slow rate. The fact that it will take a much longer time for RW to complete a full period compared to the cloud lifetimes challenges its classification as a traditional "wave". This age discrepancy should explain the phase difference, and non-synchronous oscillation found in kinematic studies.
#### Interstellar detection of O-protonated carbonyl sulfide, HOCS+

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first detection in space of O-protonated carbonyl sulfide (\ch{HOCS+}), in the midst of an ultradeep molecular line survey toward the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud. From the observation of all $K$$_a$ = 0 transitions ranging from $J$$_{lo}$ = 2 to $J$$_{lo}$ = 13 of \ch{HOCS+} covered by our survey, we derive a column density of $N$ = (9 $\pm$ 2)$\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, translating into a fractional abundance relative to H$_2$ of $\sim$7$\times$10$^{-11}$. Conversely, the S-protonated \ch{HSCO+} isomer remains undetected, and we derive an upper limit to its abundance with respect to H$_2$ of $\leq$3$\times$10$^{-11}$, a factor of $\geq$2.3 less abundant than \ch{HOCS+}. We obtain a \ch{HOCS+}/OCS ratio of $\sim$2.5$\times$10$^{-3}$, in good agreement with the prediction of astrochemical models. These models show that one of the main chemical routes to the interstellar formation of \ch{HOCS+} is likely the protonation of OCS, which appears to be more efficient at the oxygen end. Also, we find that high values of cosmic-ray ionisation rates (10$^{-15}$-10$^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$) are needed to reproduce the observed abundance of \ch{HOCS+}. In addition, we compare the O/S ratio across different interstellar environments. G+0.693-0.027 appears as the source with the lowest O/S ratio. We find a \ch{HOCO+}/\ch{HOCS+} ratio of $\sim$31, in accordance with other O/S molecular pairs detected toward this region and also close to the O/S solar value ($\sim$37). This fact indicates that S is not significantly depleted within this cloud due to the action of large-scale shocks, unlike in other sources where S-bearing species remain trapped on icy dust grains.

 - **Abstract**
 Filaments are omnipresent features in the solar atmosphere. Their location, properties and time evolution can provide information about changes in solar activity and assist the operational space weather forecast. Therefore, filaments have to be identified in full disk images and their properties extracted from these images. Manual extraction is tedious and takes much time; extraction with morphological image processing tools produces a large number of false-positive detections. Automatic object detection, segmentation, and extraction in a reliable manner allows to process more data in a shorter time. The Chromospheric Telescope (ChroTel), Tenerife, Spain, the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG), and the Kanzelh\"ohe Observatory (KSO), Austria, provide regular full-disk observations of the Sun in the core of the chromospheric H-alpha absorption line. We present a deep learning method that provides reliable extractions of filaments from H-alpha filtergrams. First, we train the object detection algorithm YOLOv5 with labeled filament data of ChroTel. We use the trained model to obtain bounding-boxes from the full GONG archive. In a second step, we apply a semi-supervised training approach, where we use the bounding boxes of filaments, to learn a pixel-wise classification of filaments with u-net. Here, we make use of the increased data set size to avoid overfitting of spurious artifacts from the generated training masks. Filaments are predicted with an accuracy of 92%. With the resulting filament segmentations, physical parameters such as the area or tilt angle can be easily determined and studied. This we demonstrate in one example, where we determine the rush-to-the pole for Solar Cycle 24 from the segmented GONG images. In a last step, we apply the filament detection to H-alpha observations from KSO which demonstrates the general applicability of our method to H-alpha filtergrams.
