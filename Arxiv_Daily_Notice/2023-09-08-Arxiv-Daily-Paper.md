#### Is a recently discovered HI cloud near M94 a starless dark matter halo?

 - **Abstract**
 Observations with the Five-Hundred-Meter Aperture Spherical Telescope have revealed the presence of a marginally-resolved source of 21 cm emission from a location $\sim50'$ from the M94 galaxy, without a stellar counterpart down to the surface brightness limit of the DESI Imaging Legacy Survey ($\sim29.15$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in the $g$ band). The system (hereafter Cloud-9) has round column density isocontours and a line width consistent with thermal broadening from gas at $T\sim2\times10^4$ $K$. These properties are unlike those of previously detected dark HI clouds and similar to the expected properties of REionization-Limited-HI Cloud (RELHICs), namely, starless dark matter (DM) halos filled with gas in hydrostatic equilibrium and in thermal equilibrium with the cosmic ultraviolet background. At the distance of M94, $d\sim4.7$ Mpc, we find that Cloud-9 is consistent with being a RELHIC inhabiting a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) DM halo of mass, $M_{200}\sim5\times10^{9}$ $M_{\odot}$, and concentration, $c_{\rm NFW}\sim13$. Although the agreement between the model and observations is good, Cloud-9 appears to be slightly, but systematically, more extended than expected for $\Lambda$CDM RELHICs. This may imply either that Cloud-9 is much closer than implied by its recessional velocity, $v_{\rm CL9}\sim300$ km s$^{-1}$, or that its halo density profile is flatter than NFW, with a DM mass deficit greater than a factor of $10$ at radii $r\lesssim1$ kpc. Further observations may aid in constraining these scenarios better and help elucidate whether Cloud-9 is the first ever observed RELHIC, a cornerstone prediction of the $\Lambda$CDM model on the smallest scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Milky Way Cepheid variables with accurate {\it Hubble Space Telescope} photometry have been established as standards for primary calibration of the cosmic distance ladder to achieve a percent-level determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$). These 75 Cepheid standards are the fundamental sample for investigation of possible residual systematics in the local $H_0$ determination due to metallicity effects on their period-luminosity relations. We obtained new high-resolution ($R\sim81,000$), high signal-to-noise ($S/N\sim50-150$) multi-epoch spectra of 42 out of 75 Cepheid standards using ESPaDOnS instrument at the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Our spectroscopic metallicity measurements are in good agreement with the literature values with systematic differences up to $0.1$ dex due to different metallicity scales. We homogenized and updated the spectroscopic metallicities of all 75 Milky Way Cepheid standards and derived their multiwavelength ($GVIJHK_s$) period-luminosity-metallicity and period-Wesenheit-metallicity relations using the latest {\it Gaia} parallaxes. The metallicity coefficients of these empirically calibrated relations exhibit large uncertainties due to low statistics and a narrow metallicity range ($\Delta\textrm{[Fe/H]}=0.6$~dex). These metallicity coefficients are up to three times better constrained if we include Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud and range between $-0.21\pm0.07$ and $-0.43\pm0.06$ mag/dex. The updated spectroscopic metallicities of these Milky Way Cepheid standards were used in the Cepheid-Supernovae distance ladder formalism to determine $H_0=72.9~\pm 1.0$\textrm{~km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$}, suggesting little variation ($\sim 0.1$ ~km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$) in the local $H_0$ measurements due to different Cepheid metallicity scales.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the spectroscopic analysis of 20 halo ab-type RR Lyrae stars with heliocentric distances between 15 and 165 kpc, conducted using medium-resolution spectra from the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle (MIKE) spectrograph. We obtain the systemic line-of-sight velocities of our targets with typical uncertainties of 5-10 km s$^{-1}$, and compute orbital parameters for a subsample out to 50 kpc from the Galactic centre, including proper motion data from Gaia DR3. The orientation of our stars' orbits, determined for an isolated Milky Way and for a model perturbed by the Large Magellanic Cloud, appears to suggest an accreted origin for at least half of the sample. In addition, we derive atmospheric parameters and chemical abundance ratios for seven stars beyond 20 kpc. The derived $\alpha$-abundances of five of these stars follow a Milky Way halo-like trend, while the other two display an underabundance of $\alpha$-elements for their [Fe/H], indicating an association with accretion events. Furthermore, based on the [Sr/Ba] ratio, we can speculate about the conditions for the formation of a potential chemically peculiar carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) RR Lyrae star. By analysing the stars' orbital parameters and abundance ratios, we find hints of association of two of our stars with two massive satellites, namely the Large Magellanic Cloud and Sagittarius. Overall, our results are in line with the suggestion that the accretion of sub-haloes largely contributes to the outer halo stellar populations.
#### Metal-THINGS: a panchromatic analysis of the local scaling relationships  of the dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 1569

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate several panchromatic scaling relations (SRs) for the dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 1569 using IFU data from the Metal-THINGS Survey. Among the spatially resolved properties analyzed, we explore SRs between the stellar mass, SFR, molecular gas, total gas, baryonic mass, gas metallicity, gas fraction, SFE and effective oxygen yields. Such multiwavelength SRs are analyzed at a spatial resolution of 180 pc, by combining our IFU observations with data from the surveys THINGS, CARMA, and archival data from DustPedia. Although we recover several known relations, our slopes are different to previously reported ones. Our star formation main sequence, Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) and molecular KS relations show higher SFRs, lower scatter, and higher correlations, with steeper (1.21), and flatter slopes (0.96, 0.58) respectively. The shape of the SRs including metallicity, stellar mass, and gas fraction are flat, with an average value of 12+log(O/H) $\sim$ 8.12 dex. The baryonic mass vs effective oxygen yields, and the stellar, gas and baryonic mass vs SFE show higher dispersions and lower correlations. Since we use the dust mass as a tracer of gas mass, we derive the Dust-to-Gas Ratio and the CO luminosity-to-molecular gas mass conversion factors, showing differences of 0.16 and 0.95 dex for the total and molecular gas surface density, respectively, in comparison to previously reported values. We use a self regulated feedback model to conclude that stellar feedback plays an important role generating outflows in NGC 1569.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) in globular clusters (GCs) raises the possibility of long-term retention of BHs within GCs. These BHs influence various astrophysical processes, including merger-driven gravitational waves and the formation of X-ray binaries. They also impact cluster dynamics by heating and creating low-density cores. Previous N-body models suggested that Palomar 5, a low-density GC with long tidal tails, may contain more than 100 BHs. To test this scenario, we conduct N-body simulations of Palomar 5 with primordial binaries to explore the influence of BHs on binary populations and the stellar mass function. Our results show that primordial binaries have minimal effect on the long-term evolution. In dense clusters with BHs, the fraction of wide binaries with periods >$10^5$ days decreases, and the disruption rate is independent of the initial period distribution. Multi-epoch spectroscopic observations of line-of-sight velocity changes can detect most bright binaries with periods below $10^4$ days, significantly improving velocity dispersion measurements. Four BH-MS binaries in the model with BHs suggests their possible detection through the same observation method. Including primordial binaries leads to a flatter inferred mass function because of spatially unresolved binaries, leading to a better match of the observations than models without binaries, particularly in Palomar 5's inner region. Future observations should focus on the cluster velocity dispersion and binaries with periods of $10^4-10^5$ days in Palomar 5's inner and tail regions to constrain BH existence.

 - **Abstract**
 Broad absorption line (BAL) quasars are characterized by gas clouds that absorb flux at the wavelength of common quasar spectral features, although blueshifted by velocities that can exceed 0.1c. BAL features are interesting as signatures of significant feedback, yet they can also compromise cosmological studies with quasars through their impact on accurate redshifts and measurements of the matter density distribution traced by the Lyman-alpha forest. The presence of BALs can also significantly contaminate the shape of the most prominent quasar emission lines and introduce systematic shifts in quasar redshifts. We present a catalog of BAL quasars discovered in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey Early Data Release, which were observed as part of DESI Survey Validation, as well as the first two months of the main survey. We describe our method to automatically identify BAL quasars in DESI data, the quantities we measure for each BAL, and investigate the completeness and purity of this method with mock DESI observations. We mask the wavelengths of the BAL features and recompute the quasar redshifts, and find the new redshifts differ by 243 km/s on average for the BAL quasar sample. These new, more accurate redshifts are important to obtain the best measurements of quasar clustering, especially at small scales. Finally, we present some spectra of rarer classes of BALs that illustrate the potential of DESI data to identify such populations for further study.
#### General-relativistic radiation transport scheme in Gmunu II:  Implementation of novel microphysical library for neutrino radiation --  Weakhub

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce \texttt{Weakhub}, a novel neutrino microphysics library that provides opacities and kernels beyond conventional interactions used in the literature. This library includes neutrino-matter, neutrino-photon, and neutrino-neutrino interactions, along with corresponding weak and strong corrections. A full kinematics approach is adopted for the calculations of $\beta$-processes, incorporating various weak corrections and medium modifications due to the nuclear equation of state. Calculations of plasma processes, electron neutrino-antineutrino annihilation, and nuclear de-excitation are included. We also present the detailed derivations of weak interactions and the coupling of them to the two-moment based general-relativistic multi-group radiation transport in the \texttt{G}eneral-relativistic \texttt{mu}ltigrid \texttt{nu}merical (\texttt{Gmunu}) code. We compare the neutrino opacity spectra for all interactions and estimate their contributions at hydrodynamical points in core-collapse supernova and binary neutron star postmerger remnant, and predict the effects of improved opacities in comparison to conventional ones for a binary neutron star postmerger at a specific hydrodynamical point. We test the implementation of the conventional set of interactions by comparing it to an open-source neutrino library \texttt{NuLib} in a core-collapse supernova simulation. We demonstrate good agreement with discrepancies of less than $\sim 10\%$ in luminosity for all neutrino species, while also highlighting the reasons contributing to the differences. To compare the advanced interactions to the conventional set in core-collapse supernova modelling, we perform simulations to analyze their impacts on neutrino signatures, hydrodynamical behaviors, and shock dynamics, showing significant deviations.
#### Diffuse gamma-ray emission around the Rosette Nebula

 - **Abstract**
 The Rosette Nebula is a young stellar cluster and molecular cloud complex, located at the edge of the southern shell of a middle-aged SNR Monoceros Loop (G205.5+0.5). We revisited the GeV gamma-ray emission towards the Rosette Nebula using more than 13 years of Fermi-LAT data. We tested several spatial models and found that compared to the result using the CO gas template only, the inclusion of the HII gas template can significantly improve the likelihood fit. We performed spectral analysis using the new spatial template. With both the gamma-ray observation and CO+HII gas data, we derived the cosmic ray spectrum of different components in the vicinity of the Rosette Nebula. We found the gamma-ray emissions from Rosette Nebula are substantially harder than previously reported, which may imply that Rosette Nebula is another example of a gamma-ray emitting young massive star cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 The binary stellar system $\eta$ Carinae is one of very few established astrophysical hadron accelerators. It seems likely that at least some fraction of the accelerated particles escape from the system. Copious target material for hadronic interactions and associated $\gamma$-ray emission exists on a wide range of spatial scales outside the binary system. This material creates a unique opportunity to trace the propagation of particles into the interstellar medium. Here we analyse $\gamma$-ray data from Fermi-LAT of $\eta$ Carinae and surrounding molecular clouds and investigate the many different scales on which escaping particles may interact and produce $\gamma$-rays. We find that interactions of escaping cosmic rays from $\eta$ Carinae in the wind region and the Homunculus Nebula could produce a significant contribution to the $\gamma$-ray emission associated with the system. Furthermore, we detect excess emission from the surrounding molecular clouds. The derived radial cosmic-ray excess profile is consistent with a steady injection of cosmic rays by a central source. However, this would require a higher flux of escaping cosmic rays from $\eta$ Carinae than provided by our model. Therefore it is likely that additional cosmic ray sources contribute to the hadronic $\gamma$-ray emission from the clouds.
#### How to make giant planets via pebble accretion

 - **Abstract**
 Planet formation is directly linked to the birthing environment that protoplanetary disks provide. The disk properties determine whether a giant planet will form and how it evolves. The number of exoplanet and disk observations is consistently rising, however, it is not yet possible to directly link these two populations. Therefore, a deep theoretical understanding of how planets form is crucial. We performed numerical simulations of planet formation via pebble and gas accretion, while including migration, in a viscously evolving protoplanetary disk, with dust growing, drifting, and evaporating at the ice lines. In our investigation of the most favorable conditions for giant planet formation, we find that these are high disk masses, early formation, and a large enough disk to host a long-lasting pebble flux. However, small disks with the same mass allow more efficient gas accretion onto planetary cores, leading to more massive gas giants. Given the right conditions, high viscosity leads to more massive cores and it enhances gas accretion. It also causes faster type II migration rates, so the giants have a decreasing final position for increasing viscosity. Intermediate dust fragmentation velocities provide the necessary pebble sizes and radial drift velocities for maximized pebble accretion and pebble flux. An enhanced dust-to-gas ratio can compensate for lower disk masses, but early formation is still crucial. We conclude that there is no specific initial parameter that leads to giant planet formation; rather, it is the outcome of a combination of complementary factors. This also implies that the diversity of the exoplanet systems is the product of the intrinsic diversity of the protoplanetary disks and it is crucial to take advantage of the increasing number and quality of observations to constrain the disk population properties and ultimately devise planet formation theories.
#### Rapid neutron star cooling triggered by accumulated dark matter

 - **Abstract**
 We study the effect of asymmetric fermionic dark matter (DM) on the thermal evolution of neutron stars (NSs). No interaction between DM and baryonic matter is assumed, except the gravitational one. Using the two-fluid formalism, we show that DM accumulated in the core of a star pulls inwards the outer baryonic layers of the star, increasing the baryonic density in the NS core. As a result, it significantly affects the star's thermal evolution by triggering an early onset of the direct Urca process and modifying the photon emission from the surface caused by the decrease of the radius. Thus, due to the gravitational pull of DM, the direct Urca process becomes kinematically allowed for stars with lower masses. Based on these results, we discuss the importance of NS observations at different distances from the Galactic center. Since the DM distribution peaks towards the Galactic center, NSs in this region are expected to contain higher DM fractions that could lead to a different cooling behavior.
