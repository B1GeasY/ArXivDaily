#### Mapping Dark Matter Through the Dust of the Milky Way Part I: Dust Correction and Phase Space Density

 - **Abstract**
 The Boltzmann equation relates the equilibrium phase space distribution of stars in the Milky Way to the Galaxy's gravitational potential. However, observations of stellar populations are biased by extinction from foreground dust, which complicates measurements of the potential in the disk and towards the Galactic center. Using the kinematics of Red Clump and Red Branch stars in Gaia DR3, we use machine learning to simultaneously estimate both the unbiased stellar phase space density and the gravitational potential. The unbiased phase space density is obtained through a learned "dust efficiency factor" -- an observational selection function that accounts for dust extinction. The potential and the dust efficiency are parameterized by fully connected neural networks and are completely data driven. We validate the dust efficiency using a recent three-dimensional dust map in this work, and examine the potential in a companion paper.
#### LOFAR non-detections of SN 2023ixf in its first year post-explosion
 - **Authors:** R. Timmerman, M. Arias, A. Botteon

 - **Abstract**
 We used the LOFAR telescope to monitor SN 2023ixf, a core-collapse supernova in M101, between 8 and 368 days post-explosion. We report non-detections down to ~80 {\mu}Jy sensitivity at 144 MHz. Our non-detections are consistent with published radio observations at higher frequencies. At the time, we are not able to constrain the properties of low-frequency absorption due to the progenitor star's circumstellar medium via these LOFAR observations.
#### Disk Evolution Study Through Imaging of Nearby Young Stars (DESTINYS): Dynamical Evidence of a Spiral-Arm-Driving and Gap-Opening Protoplanet from SAO 206462 Spiral Motion

 - **Abstract**
 In the early stages of planetary system formation, young exoplanets gravitationally interact with their surrounding environments and leave observable signatures on protoplanetary disks. Among these structures, a pair of nearly symmetric spiral arms can be driven by a giant protoplanet. For the double-spiraled SAO 206462 protoplanetary disk, we obtained three epochs of observations spanning 7 yr using the Very Large Telescope's SPHERE instrument in near-infrared $J$-band polarized light. By jointly measuring the motion of the two spirals at three epochs, we obtained a rotation rate of $-0.85^\circ\pm0.05^\circ~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. This rate corresponds to a protoplanet at $66\pm3$ au on a circular orbit dynamically driving both spirals. The derived location agrees with the gap in ALMA dust-continuum observations, indicating that the spiral driver may also carve the observed gap. What is more, a dust filament at $\sim$63 au observed by ALMA coincides with the predicted orbit of the spiral-arm-driving protoplanet. This double-spiraled system is an ideal target for protoplanet imaging.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high resolution WIYN/NEID echelle spectroscopy (R $\approx70$,000) of the supernova (SN) 2023ixf in M101, obtained 1.51 to 18.51 days after explosion over nine epochs. Daily monitoring for the first four days after explosion shows narrow emission features ($\leq200$ km s$^{-1}$), exhibiting predominantly blueshifted velocities, that rapidly weaken, broaden, and vanish in a manner consistent with radiative acceleration and the SN shock eventually overrunning or enveloping the full extent of dense circumstellar medium (CSM). The most rapid evolution is in the He I emission, which is visible on day 1.51 but disappears by day 2.62. We measure the maximum pre-SN speed of He I to be 25 $^{+0}_{-5} \pm2$ km s$^{-1}$, where the error is attributable to the uncertainty in how much the He I had already been radiatively accelerated, and to measurement of the emission line profile. The radiative acceleration of material is likely driven by the shock-CSM interaction, and the CSM is accelerated to $\geq200$ km s$^{-1}$ before being completely swept up by the SN shock to $\sim 2000$ km s$^{-1}$. We compare the observed spectra with spherically-symmetric r16wb HERACLES/CMFGEN model spectra and find the line evolution to generally be consistent with radiative acceleration and optical depth effects. The progenitor of SN2023ixf underwent an enhanced mass loss phase $\gtrsim 4$ year prior to core-collapse, creating a dense, asymmetric CSM region extending out to approximately $r_{CSM} = 3.7 \times 10^{14}$ ($v_\textrm{shock}$/9500 km s$^{-1}$) cm.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the structure of the Galactic disk is crucial for understanding the formation and evolutionary history of the Milky Way. This study examines the structure of the Galactic disk by analyzing a sample of 138,667 primary red clump (RC) stars from the LAMOST and Gaia datasets. We have categorized these RC stars into mono-age populations and investigated their spatial distributions within the R - Z plane, estimating scale heights and lengths through the fitting of their vertical and radial density profiles. Our analysis indicates that the vertical profiles of these mono-age populations fit a dual-component disk model, where both components exhibit significant flaring, particularly in the outer disk regions. Within a constant Galactocentric radius R, the scale heights of the first component, representing the morphologically thin disk, rise with age. In contrast, the scale heights of the second component, corresponding to the morphologically thick disk, remain comparatively stable across different age groups. Additionally, the radial density profiles of both disk components predominantly peak within a radial range of 7.5-8.5 kpc. These findings underscore the importance of age as a crucial factor in shaping the spatial distribution and structural evolution of the Galactic disk, offering valuable insights into its complex dynamics and history.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14766

 - **Abstract**
 We present new radio images of the supernova remnant (SNR) CTA 1 at 1420 and 408 MHz, and in the 21 cm line of H I observed with the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory Synthesis Telescope and at 1420 MHz observed with the Effelsberg 100 m telescope. We confirm previously described continuum features and elaborate further on filamentary features identified using the high-resolution (1') maps from these new observations. We investigate the abrupt change in sign of rotation measure (RM) across the SNR, using the linear polarization observations in the four bands around 1420 MHz. Following X. H. Sun et al.'s (2011) investigation, we both confirm that the distribution of signs of the RMs for extragalactic sources in the area appears to match that of the shell, as well as combine the data from the four bands to estimate the relative depolarization and the intrinsic rotation measure of the SNR. We do not conclusively reject X. H. Sun et al.'s (2011) claim of a Faraday screen in the foreground causing the distribution of RMs that we observe; however, we do suggest an alternative explanation of a swept-up stellar wind from the progenitor star with a toroidal magnetic field. Finally, we expand on the analysis of the H I observations by applying the Rolling Hough Transform to isolate filamentary structure and better identify H I emission with the SNR. Further constraining the H I velocity channels associated with CTA 1, we use more recent Galactic rotation curves to calculate an updated kinematic distance of 1.09 +/- 0.2 kpc.
#### Revision of upper bound on volume-filling intergalactic magnetic fields with LOFAR

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields present in the Large Scale Structure (LSS) of the Universe change polarization of radio waves arriving from distant extragalactic sources through the effect of Faraday rotation. This effect has been recently used to detect magnetic field in the LSS filaments based on the Rotation Measure data of the LOFAR Two-Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS). We notice that the same data also constrain the strength of the volume-filling magnetic field in the voids of the LSS. We use the LoTSS data to to derive an improved upper bound on the volume-filling field. The new upper bound provides an order of magnitude improvement on the previous Faraday rotation bounds. The new Faraday Rotation bound on the scale-invariant field that may originate from the epoch of inflation is also an order of magnitude lower than the bound on such field derived from the anisotropy analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) sensors have been demonstrated to have significant potential in X-ray astronomy, where long-term reliability is crucial for space X-ray telescopes. This study examines the long-term stability of a scientific CMOS sensor, focusing on its bias, dark current, readout noise, and X-ray spectral performance. The sensor was initially tested at -30 $^\circ$C for 16 months, followed by accelerated aging at 20 $^\circ$C. After a total aging period of 610 days, the bias map, dark current, readout noise, gain, and energy resolution exhibited no observable degradation. There are less than 50 pixels within the 4 k $\times$ 4 k array which show a decrease of the bias under 50 ms integration time by over 10 digital numbers (DNs). First-order kinetic fitting of the gain evolution predicts a gain degeneration of 0.73% over 3 years and 2.41% over 10 years. These results underscore the long-term reliability of CMOS sensors for application in space missions.
#### Formation of supermassive stars and dense star clusters in metal-poor clouds exposed to strong FUV radiation

 - **Abstract**
 The direct collapse scenario, which predicts the formation of supermassive stars (SMSs) as precursors to supermassive black holes (SMBHs), has been explored primarily under the assumption of metal-free conditions. However, environments exposed to strong far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation, which is another requirement for the direct collapse, are often chemically enriched to varying degrees. In this study, we perform radiation hydrodynamic simulations of star-cluster formation in clouds with finite metallicities, $Z=10^{-6}$ to $10^{-2} Z_{\odot}$, incorporating detailed thermal and chemical processes and radiative feedback from forming stars. Extending the simulations to approximately two million years, we demonstrate that SMSs with masses exceeding $10^4~M_\odot$ can form even in metal-enriched clouds with $Z \lesssim 10^{-3} Z_{\odot}$. The accretion process in these cases, driven by "super-competitive accretion," preferentially channels gas into central massive stars in spite of small (sub-pc) scale fragmentation. At $Z \simeq 10^{-2} Z_{\odot}$, however, enhanced cooling leads to intense fragmentation on larger scales, resulting in the formation of dense star clusters dominated by very massive stars with $10^3 M_{\odot}$ rather than SMSs. These clusters resemble young massive or globular clusters observed in the distant and local universe, exhibiting compact morphologies and high stellar surface densities. Our findings suggest that SMS formation is viable below a metallicity threshold of approximately $10^{-3} Z_{\odot}$, significantly increasing the number density of massive seed black holes to levels sufficient to account for the ubiquitous SMBHs observed in the local universe. Moreover, above this metallicity, this scenario naturally explains the transition from SMS formation to dense stellar cluster formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar spin is one of the fundamental quantities that characterize a star itself and its planetary system. Nevertheless, stellar spin-down mechanisms in protostellar and pre-main-sequence stellar phases have been a long-standing problem in the star formation theory. To realize the spin-down, previous axisymmetric models based on the conventional magnetospheric paradigm have to assume massive stellar winds or produce highly time-variable magnetospheric ejections. However, this picture has been challenged by both numerical simulations and observations. With a particular focus on the propeller regime for solar-mass stars, we propose a new picture of stellar spin-down based on our recent three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic simulation and stellar evolution calculation. We show that failed magnetospheric winds, unique to 3D models, significantly reduce the spin-up accretion torque, which make it easier for the star to spin-down. Additionally, the amplitude of time variability associated with magnetospheric ejections is reduced by 3D effects. Our simulation demonstrates that the star spins down by generating a conical disk wind, driven by a rotating stellar magnetosphere. Our theoretical estimates, inspired by the numerical model, suggest that the conical disk wind is likely to play a crucial role in extracting stellar angular momentum during the protostellar phase. As magnetospheric accretion is expected to occur in other accreting objects such as proto-giant planets, this study will also contribute to the understanding of the angular momentum of such objects.

 - **Abstract**
 For over two decades, CORSIKA 7 and its previous versions have been the leading Monte Carlo code for simulating extensive air showers. However, its monolithic Fortran-based software design and hand-optimized code has created challenges for maintenance, adaptation to new computing paradigms, and extensions for more complex simulations. Addressing these limitations, the CORSIKA 8 project represents a comprehensive rewrite of CORSIKA 7, seeing its core functionality re-envisioned in a modern and modular C++ framework. CORSIKA 8 has now reached a "physics-complete" state, offering a robust platform that encourages expert development for specialized applications. It supports high-energy hadronic interactions using models such as Sibyll 2.3d, QGSJet-II.04, EPOS-LHC, and Pythia 8.3, alongside the treatment of electromagnetic cascades with PROPOSAL 7.6.2. Key highlights are the support for multiple interaction media, including cross-media particle showers, and an enhanced calculation of radio emissions from particle showers. This contribution provides an overview of the current functionalities, showcases validation results of its simulations, and discusses future development plans.
#### Composite Dark Energy and the Cosmological Tensions

 - **Abstract**
 The standard cosmological model currently in force, aka $\Lambda$CDM, has been plagued with a variety of tensions in the last decade or so, which puts it against the wall. At the core of the $\Lambda$CDM we have a rigid cosmological term, $\Lambda$, for the entire cosmic history. Recently, the results from the DESI collaboration suggested the possibility that dark energy (DE) should be dynamical rather than just a cosmological constant. Using a generic $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization, DESI favors quintessence behavior at $\sim 3\sigma$ c.l. However, to alleviate the tensions the DE needs more features. In the proposed $w$XCDM model of [43] the DE is actually a composite cosmic fluid with two components $(X,Y)$ acting sequentially: first $X$ (above a transition redshift $z_t$) and second $Y$ (below $z_t$). Fitting the model to the data, we find that the late component $Y$ behaves as quintessence, like DESI. However, to cure the $H_0$ and growth tensions, $X$ must behave as `phantom matter' (PM), which in contrast to phantom DE provides positive pressure at the expense of negative energy density. Using the SNIa (considering separately Pantheon$+$ and DESY5), cosmic chronometers, transversal BAO, LSS data, and the full CMB likelihood from Planck 2018, we find that both tensions can be completely cut down. We also compare the $w$XCDM with our own results using the standard $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM parameterizations of the DE. In all cases, model $w$XCDM performs much better. Finally, we have repeated our analysis with BAO 3D data (replacing BAO 2D), and we still find that the dynamical DE models (including composite ones) provide a much better fit quality compared to $\Lambda$CDM. The growth tension is alleviated again, but in contrast, the $H_0$-tension remains significant, which is most likely reminiscent of the internal conflict in the BAO sector.
