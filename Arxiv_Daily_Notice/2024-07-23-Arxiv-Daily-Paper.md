 - **Abstract**
 Surveys in the Milky Way and Large Magellanic Cloud revealed that the majority of massive stars will interact with companions during their lives. However, knowledge of the binary properties of massive stars at low metallicity, which approaches the conditions of the Early Universe, remains sparse. We present the Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM) campaign - an ESO large programme designed to obtain 25 epochs of spectroscopy for 929 massive stars in the SMC - the lowest metallicity conditions in which multiplicity is probed to date (Z = 0.2 Zsun). BLOeM will provide (i) the binary fraction, (ii) the orbital configurations of systems with periods P < 3 yr, (iii) dormant OB+BH binaries, and (iv) a legacy database of physical parameters of massive stars at low metallicity. The stars are observed with the LR02 setup of the giraffe instrument of the Very Large Telescope (3960-4570A, resolving power R=6200; typical signal-to-noise ratio S/N=70-100). This paper utilises the first 9 epochs obtained over a three-month time. We describe the survey and data reduction, perform a spectral classification of the stacked spectra, and construct a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of the sample via spectral-type and photometric calibrations. The sample covers spectral types from O4 to F5, spanning the effective temperature and luminosity ranges 6.5<Teff/kK<45 and 3.7<log L/Lsun<6.1 and initial masses 8<Mini/Msun<80. It comprises 159 O-type stars, 324 early B-type (B0-3) dwarfs and giants (luminosity classes V-III), 309 early B-type supergiants (II-I), and 137 late-type supergiants. At least 75 stars are Oe/Be stars: 20 O-type and 55 B-type (13% and 10% of the respective samples). In addition, it includes four high-mass X-ray binaries, three stars resembling luminous blue variables, two bloated stripped-star candidates, two candidate magnetic stars, and 74 eclipsing binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar dust is a major foreground contaminant for many observations and a key component in the chemistry of the interstellar medium, yet its properties remain highly uncertain. Using low-resolution spectra, we accurately measure the extinction curve - a diagnostic of the grain properties - for 130 million stars, orders of magnitude more than previously available, allowing us to map its variation in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds in 3D in unprecedented detail. We find evidence that accretion is the dominant mechanism of grain growth in moderately dense regions, with coagulation dominating at higher densities. Moreover, we find that the extinction curve flattens in star-forming regions, possibly caused by cycling of large grains formed in molecular clouds, or by preferential destruction of small grains by supernova shocks.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the chemical history of interstellar OCS and SO2 by deriving a statistically-significant sample of gas-phase column densities towards massive protostars and comparing to observations of gas and ices towards other sources spanning from dark clouds to comets. We analyze a subset of 26 line-rich massive protostars observed by ALMA as part of the ALMAGAL survey. Column densities are derived for OCS and SO2 from their rare isotopologues O13CS and 34SO2 towards the compact gas around the hot core. We find that gas-phase column density ratios of OCS and SO2 with respect to methanol remain fairly constant as a function of luminosity between low- and high-mass sources, despite their very different physical conditions. The derived gaseous OCS and SO2 abundances relative to CH3OH are overall similar to protostellar ice values, with a significantly larger scatter for SO2 than for OCS. Cometary and dark-cloud ice values agree well with protostellar gas-phase ratios for OCS, whereas higher abundances of SO2 are generally seen in comets compared to the other sources. Gaseous SO2/OCS ratios are consistent with ices toward dark clouds, protostars, and comets, albeit with some scatter. The constant gas-phase column density ratios throughout low and high-mass sources indicate an early stage formation before intense environmental differentiation begins. Icy protostellar values are similar to the gas phase medians, compatible with an icy origin of these species followed by thermal sublimation. The larger spread in SO2 compared to OCS ratios w.r.t. CH3OH is likely due to a more water-rich chemical environment associated with the former, as opposed to a CO-rich origin of the latter. Post-sublimation gas-phase processing of SO2 can also contribute to the large spread. Comparisons to ices in dark clouds and comets point to a significant inheritance of OCS from earlier to later evolutionary stages.

 - **Abstract**
 The primary objective of this study is to accurately determine the abundances of Cu, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, and Ce in selected solar-type stars. This will allow us to establish observational abundance-metallicity and abundance-age relations and to explore the reasons for the excess of Ba compared to other s-elements in younger solar-type stars. We analysed HARPS spectra of main-sequence solar-type FGK stars with metallicities from -0.15 to +0.35 dex and ages from 2 to 14 Gyr using 1D LTE synthesis and MARCS atmospheric models. In the procedure of fitting synthetic to observed line profiles, the free parameters included abundance and microturbulent and macroturbulent velocity. The macroturbulent velocity can substantially compensate for NLTE effects in the line core. We find that the abundance [X/H] increases with metallicity and age. The ratio of the abundances of s-process elements [s/Fe] increases with decreasing metallicity and age, while the [Cu/Fe] ratio increases with both metallicity and age. These observed trends agree well with published observational data and with predictions from Galactic chemical evolution models. A small [Ba/Fe] enhancement of 0.08 +/- 0.08 dex has been detected in seven younger stars with an average age of 2.8 +/- 0.6 Gyr. Compared to the abundances of other s-process elements, [Ba/Fe] is 0.07 and 0.08 dex higher than La and Ce on average, respectively. Furthermore, we find that the [Ba/Fe] ratio increases with increasing chromospheric activity. The average [Ba/Fe] for the three most active stars is 0.15 +/- 0.10 dex higher than that of the other stars. Chromospheric activity can significantly alter the physical conditions in the formation layers of the Ba lines. Our primary conclusion is that to account for the observed excess of [Ba/Fe] abundance in younger stars, it is essential to use more complex atmospheric models that incorporate magnetic structures.

 - **Abstract**
 Impacts between differentiated planetesimals are ubiquitous in protoplanetary discs and may mix materials from the core, mantle, and crust of planetesimals, thus forming stony-iron meteorites. The surface composition of the asteroid (16) Psyche represents a mixture of metal and non-metal components. However, the velocities, angles, and outcome regimes of impacts that mixed metal and silicate from different layers of planetesimals are debated. Our aim is to investigate the impacts between planetesimals that can mix large amounts of metal and silicate, and the mechanism of stony-iron meteorite formation. We used smooth particle hydrodynamics to simulate the impacts between differentiated planetesimals with various initial conditions that span different outcome regimes. In our simulations, the material strength was included and the effects of the states of planetesimal cores were studied. Using a statistical approach, we quantitatively analysed the distributions of metal and silicate after impacts. Our simulations modelled the mass, depth, and sources of the metal-silicate mixture in different impact conditions. Our results suggest that the molten cores in planetesimals could facilitate mixing of metal and silicate. Large amounts of the metal-silicate mixture could be produced by low-energy accretional impacts and high-energy erosive impacts in the largest impact remnant, and by hit-and-run and erosive impacts in the second-largest impact remnant. After impact, most of the metal-silicate mixture was buried at depth, consistent with the low cooling rates of stony-iron meteorites. Our results indicate that mesosiderites potentially formed in an erosive impact, while pallasites potentially formed in an accretional or hit-and-run impact. The mixing of metal and non-metal components on Psyche may also be the result of impacts.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-calibration methods with the CLEAN algorithm have been widely employed in Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) data processing in order to correct antenna-based amplitude and phase corruptions present in the data. However, human interaction during the conventional CLEAN self-calibration process can impose a strong effective prior, which in turn may produce artifacts within the final image and hinder the reproducibility of final results. In this work, we aim to demonstrate a combined self-calibration and imaging method for VLBI data in a Bayesian inference framework. The method corrects for amplitude and phase gains for each antenna and polarization mode by inferring the temporal correlation of the gain solutions. We use Stokes I data of M87 taken with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 43GHz, pre-calibrated using the rPICARD CASA-based pipeline. For antenna-based gain calibration and imaging, we use the Bayesian imaging software resolve. To estimate gain and image uncertainties, we use a Variational Inference method. We obtain a high-resolution M87 Stokes I image at 43GHz in conjunction with antenna-based gain solutions using our Bayesian self-calibration and imaging method. The core with counter-jet structure is better resolved, and extended jet emission is better described compared to the CLEAN reconstruction. Furthermore, uncertainty estimation of the image and antenna-based gains allows us to quantify the reliability of the result. Our Bayesian self-calibration and imaging method is able to reconstruct robust and reproducible Stokes I images and gain solutions with uncertainty estimation by taking into account the uncertainty information in the data.
#### Probing 3D magnetic fields using starlight polarization and grain alignment theory

 - **Abstract**
 Polarization of starlight induced by dust grains aligned with the magnetic field (hereafter B-field) is widely used to measure the two-dimensional B-fields projected onto the plane-of-sky. Here, we introduce a new method to infer three-dimensional B-fields using starlight polarization. The B-field's inclination angle or line-of-sight (LOS) component of B-fields is constrained by the starlight polarization efficiency from observations and the alignment degree provided by the magnetically enhanced radiative torque (MRAT) alignment theory. We first perform synthetic observation of starlight polarization of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a filamentary cloud. We then test the new technique with our updated POLARIS code and find that the B-field's inclination angles can be precisely determined by the starlight polarization efficiency from synthetic observations. Regardless of grain magnetic properties, the technique can provide an accurate constraint on B-field's inclination angles in low-density regions $N_{\rm H} < 5\times 10^{21}\,\cm^{-2}$ (or visual extinction $A_{V}< 3$) using optical polarization, whereas the technique can infer further to high-density regions $N_{\rm H} \sim 5 \times 10^{22}\,\cm^{-2}$ (or $A_{V}\sim 30$) using near-infrared polarization. Our new technique opens the full potential of tracing 3D B-fields and constraining dust properties and grain alignment physics on multiple scales of the diffuse interstellar medium and star-forming regions using multi-wavelength starlight polarization observations.

 - **Abstract**
 It is under debate whether the magnetic field in the solar atmosphere carries neutralized electric currents; particularly, whether a magnetic flux rope (MFR), which is considered the core structure of coronal mass ejections, carries neutralized electric currents. Recently Wang et al. (2023, ApJ, 943, 80) studied magnetic flux and electric current measured at the footpoints of 28 eruptive MFRs from 2010 to 2015. Because of the small sample size, no rigorous statistics has been done. Here, we include 9 more events from 2016 to 2023 and perform a series of nonparametric statistical tests at a significance level of 5\%. The tests confirm that there exist no significant differences in magnetic properties between conjugated footpoints of the same MFR, which justifies the method of identifying the MFR footpoints through coronal dimming. The tests demonstrate that there exist no significant differences between MFRs with pre-eruption dimming and those with only post-eruption dimming. However, there is a medium level of association between MFRs carrying substantial net current and those produce pre-eruption dimming, which can be understood by the Lorentz-self force of the current channel. The tests also suggest that in estimating the magnetic twist of MFRs, it is necessary to take into account the spatially inhomogeneous distribution of electric current density and magnetic field.

 - **Abstract**
 In astrochemistry, computational methods play a crucial role in addressing fundamental astronomical questions. Interstellar molecules profoundly influence the chemistry and physics of the interstellar medium (ISM), playing pivotal roles in planet formation and the emergence of life. Understanding their chemistry relies on theoretical approaches such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) and post-Hartree-Fock methods, which are essential for exploring pathways to molecular complexity and determining their interstellar abundances. Various theoretical methods investigate the formation of interstellar molecules in both gaseous and solid states. Molecules in interstellar space may originate from bottom-up processes (building up from CO molecules) or top-down processes (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon fragmentation). Here, we present a journey of theoretical investigations aimed at studying the reactivity of interstellar molecules in space.
#### A New Perspective on the Diffuse Gamma-Ray Emission Excess

 - **Abstract**
 The Large High-Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) recently published measurements of diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission (DGE) in the 10-1000 TeV energy range. The measured DGE flux is significantly higher than the expectation from hadronic interactions between cosmic rays (CRs) and the interstellar medium. This excess has been proposed to originate from unknown extended sources produced by electron radiation, such as pulsar wind nebulae or pulsar halos (PWNe/halos). In this study, we propose a new perspective to explain the DGE excess observed by LHAASO. The masking regions used in the LHAASO DGE measurement may not fully encompass the extended signals of PWNe/halos. By employing a two-zone diffusion model for electrons around pulsars, we find that the DGE excess in most regions of the Galactic plane can be well explained by the signal leakage model under certain parameters. Our results indicate that the signal leakage from known sources and contributions from unresolved sources should be considered complementary in explaining the DGE excess.

 - **Abstract**
 Building on the success of previous missions, asteroseismic modelling will play a key role in future space-based missions, such as PLATO, CubeSpec, and Roman. Despite remarkable achievements, asteroseismology has revealed significant discrepancies in the physics of theoretical stellar models, which have the potential to bias stellar characterisation at the precision level demanded by PLATO. The current modelling strategies largely overlook magnetic activity, assuming that its effects are masked by filtering the so-called surface effects. Given the presence of activity cycles in multiple solar-like oscillators, and activity variations in a significant fraction of Kepler observations of main-sequence stars (Santos et al. 2019b, 2021, 2023), we measured the impact of magnetic activity on the asteroseismic characterisation of the Sun based on 26.5 years of GOLF and BiSON observations. While magnetic activity is partially absorbed in the treatment of surface effects, we found a discernible imprint of the activity cycle in the determination of the solar age. Notably, this imprint persists across both BiSON and GOLF datasets, with significant variations of up to 6.5% observed between solar minima and maxima. Considering that the Sun exhibits low levels of activity, our study underscores the looming challenge posed by magnetic activity for future photometry missions, and prompts a potential reevaluation of the asteroseismic characterisation of Kepler's most active targets.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of two distinct and apparently unrelated populations of dusty stellar objects in the Nuclear Stellar Cluster (NSC) of the Milky Way, namely IRS 13 and the S-cluster, are potentially prone to a general process describing the star formation history in the Galactic Center (GC). The former cluster is thought to be entangled in the clockwise and counterclockwise disks, a large-scale stellar distribution revealed by the analysis of stars at different distances from Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole in the GC. Recently, this large-scale distribution was reported to exhibit a multi-disk structure with at least four components. Motivated by this finding, we revisit the anisotropic IRS 13 cluster and find strong evidence for a disk-like structure. An examination of about 50 individual stellar orbits reveals a new structure that does not follow any trend known in the literature. Furthermore, we investigate the possibility of an inspiral cluster undergoing star formation processes, as proposed by several authors. Using a simplified N-body simulation to reproduce our observational results, we conclude that, under certain conditions, a massive cluster can migrate from the Circum Nuclear Disk toward the inner parsec. Based on this classification, we revisit the large-scale NACO (VLT) observations of IRS 13 and find evidence for a separation of the cluster into a gravitationally stable core remnant and a dissipating part. With the velocity-resolved H30{\alpha} line and the broadband spectral energy distribution of IRS 13E3, we provide tentative support for the existence of an intermediate-mass black hole of ~ 3 x 10^26 M_sun surrounded by a hot gaseous stream.
#### Unveiling the Multifaceted GRB 200613A: Prompt Emission Dynamics, Afterglow Evolution, and the Host Galaxy's Properties

 - **Abstract**
 We present our optical observations and multi-wavelength analysis of the GRB\,200613A detected by \texttt{Fermi} satellite. Time-resolved spectral analysis of the prompt $\gamma$-ray emission was conducted utilizing the Bayesian block method to determine statistically optimal time bins. Based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), the data generally favor the Band+Blackbody (short as BB) model. We speculate that the main Band component comes from the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, while the additional BB component comes from the neutrino annihilation process. The BB component becomes significant for a low-spin, high-accretion rate black hole central engine, as evidenced by our model comparison with the data. The afterglow light curve exhibits typical power-law decay, and its behavior can be explained by the collision between the ejecta and constant interstellar medium (ISM). Model fitting yields the following parameters: $E_{K,iso} = (2.04^{+11.8}_{-1.50})\times 10^{53}$ erg, $\Gamma_0=354^{+578}_{-217}$, $p=2.09^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$, $n_{18}=(2.04^{+9.71}_{-1.87})\times 10^{2}$ cm$^{-3}$, $\theta_j=24.0^{+6.50}_{-5.54}$ degree, $\epsilon_e=1.66^{+4.09}_{-1.39})\times 10^{-1}$ and $\epsilon_B=(7.76^{+48.5}_{-5.9})\times 10^{-6}$. In addition, we employed the public Python package \texttt{Prospector} perform a spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling of the host galaxy. The results suggest that the host galaxy is a massive galaxy ($\log(M_\ast / M_\odot)=11.75^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$) with moderate star formation rate ($\mbox{SFR}=22.58^{+13.63}_{-7.22} M_{\odot}$/yr). This SFR is consistent with the SFR of $\sim 34.2 M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ derived from the [OII] emission line in the observed spectrum.
