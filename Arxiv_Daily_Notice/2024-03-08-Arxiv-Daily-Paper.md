 - **Abstract**
 The majority of massive stars are expected to exchange mass or merge with a companion during their lives. This immediately implies that most supernovae (SNe) are from such post-mass-exchange objects. Here, we explore how mass accretion and merging affect the pre-SN structures of stars and their final fates. We use the stellar evolution code MESA, infer the outcome of core-collapse using a neutrino-driven SN model, and apply a rapid-accretion model. Our models cover initial masses from 11 to 70 Msun and the accreted mass ranges from 10-200% of the initial mass. We find that mass accretion in particular onto post-main-sequence (post-MS) stars can lead to a long-lived blue supergiant (BSG) phase. In comparison to genuine single stars, post-MS accretors have small core-to-total mass ratios, regardless of whether they end their lives as BSGs or cool supergiants (CSGs), and they can have genuinely different pre-SN core structures. As in single and binary-stripped stars, we find black-hole (BH) formation for the same characteristic CO core masses M_CO of ~7 Msun and >13 Msun. In models with the largest mass accretion, the BH-formation landscape as a function of M_CO is shifted by about 0.5 Msun to lower masses. We find a tight relation between our neutron-star (NS) masses and the central entropy of the pre-SN models, suggesting a universal relation that is independent of the evolutionary history of stars. Post-MS accretors explode both as BSGs and CSGs, and we show how to understand their pre-SN locations in the Hertzsprung--Russell diagram. Some BSGs that avoid the luminous-blue-variable (LBV) regime are predicted to collapse into BHs of up to 50 Msun while others explode in supernovae and eject up to 40 Msun, greatly exceeding ejecta masses from single stars. These masses can be even higher at lower metallicities, and they may fall into the pair-instability-supernova mass gap. [abridged]
#### Direct Imaging Discovery of a Substellar Companion Orbiting the  Accelerating Variable Star, HIP 39017

 - **Abstract**
 We present the direct imaging discovery of a substellar companion (a massive planet or low-mass brown dwarf) to the young, $\gamma$ Doradus-type variable star, HIP 39017 (HD 65526). The companion's SCExAO/CHARIS JHK ($1.1-2.4\mu$m) spectrum and Keck/NIRC2 L$^{\prime}$ photometry indicate that it is an L/T transition object. A comparison of the JHK+L$^{\prime}$ spectrum to several atmospheric model grids finds a significantly better fit to cloudy models than cloudless models. Orbit modeling with relative astrometry and precision stellar astrometry from Hipparcos and Gaia yields a semi-major axis of $23.8^{+8.7}_{-6.1}$ au, a dynamical companion mass of $30^{+31}_{-12}$~M$_J$, and a mass ratio of $\sim$1.9\%, properties most consistent with low-mass brown dwarfs. However, its mass estimated from luminosity models is a lower $\sim$13.8 $M_{\rm J}$ due to an estimated young age ($\lesssim$ 115 Myr); using a weighted posterior distribution informed by conservative mass constraints from luminosity evolutionary models yields a lower dynamical mass of $23.6_{-7.4}^{+9.1}$~M$_J$ and a mass ratio of $\sim$1.4\%. Analysis of the host star's multi-frequency $\gamma$ Dor-type pulsations, astrometric monitoring of HIP 39017b, and Gaia DR4 astrometry of the star will clarify the system age and better constrain the mass and orbit of the companion. This discovery further reinforces the improved efficiency of targeted direct imaging campaigns informed by long-baseline, precision stellar astrometry.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) and how it may vary with galactic environment is a matter of debate. Certain star formation theories involve a close connection between the IMF and the Core Mass Function (CMF) and so it is important to measure this CMF in a range of locations in the Milky Way. Here we study the CMF of three Galactic Center clouds: G0.253+0.016 ("The Brick"), Sgr B2 (Deep South field) and Sgr C. We use ALMA 1 mm continuum images and identify cores as peaks in thermal dust emission via the dendrogram algorithm. We develop a completeness correction method via synthetic core insertion, where a realistic mass-dependent size distribution is used for the synthetic cores. After corrections, a power law of the form $\text{d}N/\text{d}\log M \propto M^{-\alpha}$ is fit to the CMFs above 2 M$_\odot$. The three regions show disparate CMFs, with the Brick showing a Salpeter-like power law index $\alpha=1.21\pm0.11$ and the other two regions showing shallower indices ($\alpha=0.92\pm0.09$ for Sgr C and $\alpha=0.66\pm0.05$ for Sgr B2-DS). Furthermore, we analyze the spatial distribution and mass segregation of cores in each region. Sgr C and Sgr B2-DS show signs of mass segregation, but the Brick does not. We compare our results to several other CMFs from different Galactic regions derived with the same methods. Finally, we discuss how these results may help define an evolutionary sequence of star cluster formation and can be used to test star formation theories.

 - **Abstract**
 High angular resolution imaging is an increasingly important capability in contemporary astrophysics. Of particular relevance to emerging fields such as the characterisation of exoplanetary systems, imaging at the required spatial scales and contrast levels results in forbidding challenges in the correction of atmospheric phase errors, which in turn drives demanding requirements for precise wavefront sensing. Asgard is the next-generation instrument suite at the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), targeting advances in sensitivity, spectral resolution and nulling interferometry. In this paper, we describe the requirements and designs of three core modules: Heimdallr, a beam combiner for fringe tracking, low order wavefront correction and visibility science; Baldr, a Zernike wavefront sensor to correct high order atmospheric aberrations; and Solarstein, an alignment and calibration unit. In addition, we draw generalisable insights for designing such system and discuss integration plans.

 - **Abstract**
 Abbreviation. Thermal diffusion is one of the basic processes for the mobility and formation of species on cosmic dust grains. Recent laboratory measurements have found that the diffusion pre-exponential factor can differ from that for desorption by several orders of magnitude. We aim to evaluate the effect of the newly experimentally measured diffusion pre-exponential factor on the chemistry under cold molecular cloud conditions. We found that statistically, more than half of the total gas-phase and grain surface species are not affected by the new pre-exponential factor after a chemical evolution of 10$^5$ yr. The most abundant gas-phase CO and grain surface water ice are not affected by the new pre-exponential factor. For the grain surface species that are affected, compared to the commonly adopted value of the pre-exponential factor for diffusion used in the chemical models, they could be either overproduced or underproduced with the lower diffusion pre-factor used in this work. The former case applies to radicals and the species that serve as reactants, while the latter case applies to complex organic molecules (COMs) on the grain and the species that rarely react with other species. Gas-phase species could also be affected due to the desorption of the grain surface species. The abundance of some gas-phase COMs could be varied by over one order of magnitude depending on the adopted grain surface temperature and/or the ratio of diffusion to desorption energy in the model. Key species whose diffusion pre-exponential factor significantly affects the model predictions were also evaluated, and these specie include CH3OH, H2CO, and NO. The results presented in this study show that the pre-exponential factor is one of the basic and important parameters in astrochemical models.

 - **Abstract**
 Simulations of pre-supernova evolution suggest that some intense shell burning can be so active that, in extreme cases, it can merge with the outer shell, changing the initial conditions for the supernova explosion. However, such violent activity in the interior of stars has been difficult to confirm from observations of stars. Here we propose that the elemental composition of O-rich ejecta in supernova remnants can be a tool to test for this kind of intense shell burning activity in the final stages of progenitor evolution. As an example, we discuss the origin of "Mg-rich" ejecta in the supernova remnant N49B. A high Mg/Ne mass ratio $\gtrsim 1$ suggests that the Ne- or O-burning shell has broken into or merged with the outer shell before the collapse. Such Mg-rich (or Ne-poor) ejecta has been identified in some other supernova remnants, supporting the idea that some destratification process, such as a shell merger, does indeed occur in the interiors of some massive stars, although they may not be the majority. Our results suggest that X-ray observations of O-rich ejecta in core-collapse supernova remnants will be a unique tool to probe the shell burning activity during the final stage of a massive star's interior.
#### Partial tidal disruption events: The elixir of life

 - **Abstract**
 In our Galactic Center, about 10,000 to 100,000 stars are estimated to have survived tidal disruption events, resulting in partially disrupted remnants. These events occur when a supermassive black hole (SMBH) tidally interacts with a star, but not enough to completely disrupt the star. We use the 1D stellar evolution code Kepler and the 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics code Phantom to model the tidal disruption of 1, 3, and 10 solar mass stars at zero-age (ZAMS), middle-age (MAMS), and terminal-age main-sequence (TAMS). We map the disruption remnants into Kepler in order to understand their post-distribution evolution. We find distinct characteristics in the remnants, including increased radius, rapid core rotation, and differential rotation in the envelope. The remnants undergo composition mixing that affects their stellar evolution. Whereas the remnants formed by disruption of ZAMS models evolve similarly to unperturbed models of the same mass, for MAMS and TAMS stars, the remnants have higher luminosity and effective temperature. Potential observational signatures include peculiarities in nitrogen and carbon abundances, higher luminosity, rapid rotation, faster evolution, and unique tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram
#### Multi-frequency VLBI Imaging of the Sub-parsec Scale Jet In the Sombrero  Galaxy (M 104)

 - **Abstract**
 We report multi-frequency and multi-epoch VLBI studies of the sub-parsec jet in Sombrero galaxy (M 104, NGC 4594). Using Very Long Baseline Array data at 12, 22, 44, and 88 GHz, we study the kinematics of the jet and the properties of the compact core. The sub-parsec jet is clearly detected at 12 and 22 GHz, and the inner jet base is resolved down to $\sim70$ Schwarzschild radii ($R_{\rm s}$) at 44 GHz. The proper motions of the jet are measured with apparent sub-relativistic speeds of $0.20\pm0.08 c$ and $0.05\pm0.02 c$ for the approaching and the receding jet, respectively. Based on the apparent speed and jet-to-counter-jet brightness ratio, we estimate the jet viewing angle to be larger than $\sim37^{\circ}$, and the intrinsic speed to be between $\sim0.10 c$ and $0.40 c$. Their joint probability distribution suggests the most probable values of the viewing angle and intrinsic speed to be ${66^{\circ}}^{+4^\circ}_{-6^\circ}$ and $0.19\pm0.04 c$, respectively. We also find that the measured brightness temperatures of the core at 12, 22 and 44 GHz are close to the equipartition brightness temperature, indicating that the energy density of the radiating particles is comparable to the energy density of the magnetic field in the sub-parsec jet region. Interestingly, the measured core size at 88 GHz ($\sim25\pm5 R_{s}$) deviates from the expected frequency dependence seen at lower frequencies. This may indicate a different origin for the millimeter emission, which can explained by an Advection Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF) model. This model further predicts that at 230 and 340 GHz, the ADAF may dominate the radio emission over the jet.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Magnetic fields can play crucial roles in high-mass star formation. Nonetheless, the significance of magnetic fields at various scales and their relationship with gas structures is largely overlooked. Aims: Our goal is to examine the relationship between the magnetic field and molecular gas structures within the Orion A giant molecular cloud at different scales and density regimes. Methods: We assess the gas intensity structures and column densities in Orion A by utilizing $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O from Nobeyama observations. Through comparing Nobeyama observations with {\it{Planck}} polarization observations on large scales ($\sim0.6$ pc) and JCMT polarization observations on small scales ($\sim0.04$ pc), we investigate how the role of magnetic fields change with scale and density. Results: We find a similar trend from parallel to perpendicular alignment with increasing column densities in Orion A at both large and small spatial scales. Besides, when changing from low-density to high-density tracers, the relative orientation preference changes from random to perpendicular. The self-similar results at different scales indicate that magnetic fields are dynamically important in both cloud formation and filament formation. However, magnetic fields properties at small scales are relative complicated, and the interplay between magnetic field and star-forming activities needs to be discussed case-by-case.

 - **Abstract**
 We provide an analysis of a convolutional neural network's ability to identify the lensing signal of single dark matter subhalos in strong galaxy-galaxy lenses in the presence of increasingly complex source light morphology. We simulate a balanced dataset of 800,000 strong lens images both perturbed and unperturbed by a single subhalo ranging in virial mass between $10^{7.5} M_{\odot} - 10^{11}M_{\odot}$ and characterise the source complexity by the number of Sersic clumps present in the source plane ranging from 1 to 5. Using the ResNet50 architecture we train the network to classify images as either perturbed or unperturbed. We find that the network is able to detect subhalos at low enough masses to distinguish between dark matter models even with complex sources and that source complexity has little impact on the accuracy beyond 3 clumps. The model was more confident in its classification when the clumps in the source were compact, but cared little about their spatial distribution. We also tested for the resolution of the data, finding that even in conditions akin to natural seeing the model was still able to achieve an accuracy of 74% in our highest peak signal-to-noise datasets, though this is heavily dominated by the high mass subhalos. It's robustness against resolution is attributed to the model learning the flux ratio anomalies in the perturbed lenses which are conserved in the lower resolution data.
#### Fast fitting of spectral lines with Gaussian and hyperfine structure  models

 - **Abstract**
 The fitting of spectral lines is a common step in the analysis of line observations and simulations. However, the observational noise, the presence of multiple velocity components, and potentially large data sets make it a non-trivial task. We present a new computer program Spectrum Iterative Fitter (SPIF) for the fitting of spectra with Gaussians or with hyperfine line profiles. The aim is to show the computational efficiency of the program and to use it to examine the general accuracy of approximating spectra with simple models. We describe the implementation of the program. To characterise its performance, we examined spectra with isolated Gaussian components or a hyperfine structure, also using synthetic observations from numerical simulations of interstellar clouds. We examined the search for the globally optimal fit and the accuracy to which single-velocity-component and multi-component fits recover true values for parameters such as line areas, velocity dispersion, and optical depth. The program is shown to be fast, with fits of single Gaussian components reaching on graphics processing units speeds approaching one million spectra per second. This also makes it feasible to use Monte Carlo simulations or Markov chain Monte Carlo calculations for the error estimation. However, in the case of hyperfine structure lines, degeneracies affect the parameter estimation and can complicate the derivation of the error estimates. The use of many random initial values makes the fits more robust, both for locating the global $\chi^2$ minimum and for the selection of the optimal number of velocity components.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to determine the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios for HCN in six starless and prestellar cores and compare the results between the direct method using radiative transfer modeling and the indirect double isotope method assuming a fixed $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio. We present IRAM 30m observations of the HCN 1-0, HCN 3-2, HC15N 1-0 and H13CN 1-0 transitions toward six embedded cores. The ${}^{14}$N/${}^{15}$N ratio was derived using both the indirect double isotope method and directly through non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) 1D radiative transfer modeling of the HCN emission. The latter also provides the ${}^{12}$C/${}^{13}$C ratio, which we compared to the local interstellar value. The derived ${}^{14}$N/${}^{15}$N ratios using the indirect method are generally in the range of 300-550. This result could suggest an evolutionary trend in the nitrogen fractionation of HCN between starless cores and later stages of the star formation process. However, the direct method reveals lower fractionation ratios of around $\sim$250, mainly resulting from a lower ${}^{12}$C/${}^{13}$C ratio in the range $\sim$20-40, as compared to the local interstellar medium value of 68. This study reveals a significant difference between the nitrogen fractionation ratio in HCN derived using direct and indirect methods. This can influence the interpretation of the chemical evolution and reveal the pitfalls of the indirect double isotope method for fractionation studies. However, the direct method is challenging, as it requires well-constrained source models to produce accurate results. No trend in the nitrogen fractionation of HCN between earlier and later stages of the star formation process is evident when the results of the direct method are considered.
#### Exploring NGC 2345: A Comprehensive Study of a Young Open Cluster  through Photometric and Kinematic Analysis

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted a photometric and kinematic analysis of the young open cluster NGC 2345 using CCD \emph{UBV} data from 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT), \emph{Gaia} Data Release 3 (DR3), 2MASS, and the APASS datasets. We found 1732 most probable cluster members with membership probability higher than 70$\%$. The fundamental and structural parameters of the cluster are determined based on the cluster members. The mean proper motion of the cluster is estimated to be $\mu_{\alpha}cos\delta$ = ${-1.34}\pm0.20$ and $\mu_{\delta}$= $1.35\pm 0.21$ mas $yr^{-1}$. Based on the radial density profile, the estimated radius is $\sim$ 12.8 arcmin (10.37 pc). Using color-color and color-magnitude diagrams, we estimate the reddening, age, and distance to be $0.63\pm0.04$ mag, 63 $\pm$ 8 Myr, and 2.78 $\pm$ 0.78 kpc, respectively. The mass function slope for main-sequence stars is determined as $1.2\pm 0.1$. The mass function slope in the core, halo, and overall region indicates a possible hint of mass segregation. The cluster's dynamical relaxation time is 177.6 Myr, meaning ongoing mass segregation, with complete equilibrium expected in 100-110 Myr. Apex coordinates are determined as $-40^{\circ}.89 \pm 0.12, -44^{\circ}.99 \pm 0.15$. The cluster's orbit in the Galaxy suggests early dissociation in field stars due to its close proximity to the Galactic disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Cross sections and rate coefficients for the Dissociative Recombination (DR) of the NS+ ion induced by collisions with low-energy electrons are reported for temperatures between 10 and 1000 K, relevant to a large range of interstellar cloud temperatures. Uncertainties are discussed for these rates. Comparisons are made with DR rates for the isovalent NO+ molecular ion which are found to be much faster. The present findings lead to a moderate dissociative reaction rate coefficient, smaller by a factor of 2 than the current estimates reported in the different kinetic databases for a temperature of 10 K. We consider that our rate coefficients obtained through multichannel quantum defect theory for NS+ are likely to be better than those displayed in the different kinetic databases.

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular emission is used to investigate both the physical and chemical properties of protoplanetary disks. Therefore, to accurately derive disk properties, we need a thorough understanding of the behavior of the molecular probes we rely on. Here we investigate how the molecular line emission of N$_2$H$^+$, HCO$^+$, HCN, and C$^{18}$O compare to other measured quantities in a set of 20 protoplanetary disks. Overall, we find positive correlations between multiple line fluxes and the disk dust mass and radius. We also generally find strong positive correlations between the line fluxes of different molecular species. However, some disks do show noticeable differences in the relative fluxes of N$_2$H$^+$, HCO$^+$, HCN, and C$^{18}$O. These differences occur even within a single star-forming region. This results in a potentially large range of different disk masses and chemical compositions for systems of similar age and birth environment. While we make preliminary comparisons of molecular fluxes across different star-forming regions, more complete and uniform samples are needed in the future to search for trends with birth environment or age.
