 - **Abstract**
 The chemical abundances of Milky Way's satellites reflect their star formation histories (SFHs), yet, due to the difficulty of determining the ages of old stars, the SFHs of most satellites are poorly measured. Ongoing and upcoming surveys will obtain around ten times more medium-resolution spectra for stars in satellites than are currently available. To correctly extract SFHs from large samples of chemical abundances, the relationship between chemical abundances and SFHs needs to be clarified. Here, we perform a high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy with detailed models of star formation, supernova feedback, and metal diffusion. We quantify SFHs, metallicity distribution functions, and the $\alpha$-element (Mg, Ca, and Si) abundances in satellites of the host galaxy. We find that star formation in most simulated satellites is quenched before infalling to their host. Star formation episodes in simulated satellites are separated by a few hundred Myr owing to supernova feedback; each star formation event produces groups of stars with similar [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Fe/H]. We then perform a mock observation of the upcoming Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) observations. We find that Subaru PFS will be able to detect distinct groups of stars in [$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] space, produced by episodic star formation. This result means that episodic SFHs can be estimated from the chemical abundances of $\gtrsim$ 1,000 stars determined with medium-resolution spectroscopy.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the hypothesis that multipolar magnetic fields advected by photospheric granules can contribute heating to the active chromosphere and corona. On 28 September 2020 the GRIS and HiFI+ instruments at the GREGOR telescope obtained data of NOAA 12773. We analyze Stokes profiles of spectral lines of Si I and He I, to study magnetic fields from photosphere to the upper chromosphere. Magnetogram and EUV data from the HMI and AIA instruments on the SDO spacecraft are co-aligned and studied in relation to the GRIS data. At coronal loop footpoints, minor polarity fields comprise just 0.2% and 0.02% of the flux measured over the 40" x 60" area observed in the photosphere and upper chromosphere, centered 320" from disk center. Significantly, the minority fields are situated >~ 12" from bright footpoints. We use physical arguments to show that any unresolved minority flux cannot reach coronal footpoints adjacent to the upper chromosphere. Even if it did, the most optimistic estimate of the energy released through chromospheric reconnection is barely sufficient to account for the coronal energy losses. Further, dynamical changes accompanying reconnection between uni- and multi- polar fields are seen neither in the He I data nor in narrow-band movies of the H alpha line core. We conclude that the hypothesis must be rejected. Bright chromospheric, transition region and coronal loop plasmas must be heated by mechanisms involving unipolar fields.

          From Young Massive Clusters to Old Globular Clusters: Density Profile Evolution and IMBH Formation

 - **Abstract**
 The surface brightness profiles of globular clusters are conventionally described with the well-known King profile. However, observations of young massive clusters (YMCs) in the local Universe suggest that they are better fit by simple models with flat central cores and simple power-law densities in their outer regions (such as the Elson-Fall-Freeman, or EFF, profile). Depending on their initial central density, these YMCs may also facilitate large numbers of stellar collisions, potentially creating very massive stars that will directly collapse to intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). Using Monte Carlo $N$-body models of YMCs, we show that EFF-profile clusters transform to Wilson or King profiles through natural dynamical evolution, but that their final $W_0$ parameters do not strongly correlate to their initial concentrations. The most centrally-dense YMCs can produce runaway stellar mergers as massive as $4000\,M_{\odot}$ (the largest resolved mass in our simulations) which can collapse to produce IMBHs of similar masses. In doing so, these runaway collisions also deplete the clusters of their primordial massive stars, reducing the number of stellar-mass BHs by as much as $\sim$ 40\%. This depletion will accelerate the core collapse of clusters, suggesting that the process of IMBH formation itself may produce the high densities observed in some core-collapsed clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Optimal extraction of cosmological information from observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background critically relies on our ability to accurately undo the distortions caused by weak gravitational lensing. In this work, we demonstrate the use of denoising diffusion models in performing Bayesian lensing reconstruction. We show that score-based generative models can produce accurate, uncorrelated samples from the CMB lensing convergence map posterior, given noisy CMB observations. To validate our approach, we compare the samples of our model to those obtained using established Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods, which assume a Gaussian lensing potential. We then go beyond this assumption of Gaussianity, and train and validate our model on non-Gaussian lensing data, obtained by ray-tracing N-body simulations. We demonstrate that in this case, samples from our model have accurate non-Gaussian statistics beyond the power spectrum. The method provides an avenue towards more efficient and accurate lensing reconstruction, that does not rely on an approximate analytic description of the posterior probability. The reconstructed lensing maps can be used as an unbiased tracer of the matter distribution, and to improve delensing of the CMB, resulting in more precise cosmological parameter inference.

          Massive interacting binaries as an enrichment source for multiple populations in star clusters

 - **Abstract**
 We present a suite of binary evolution models with massive primaries (10 $\leq$ M$_1$ $\leq$ 40 M$_\odot$) and periods and mass ratios chosen such that the systems undergo non-conservative mass transfer while the primaries have helium cores. We track the total mass and chemical composition of the ejecta from these systems. This material shows the abundance signatures of hot hydrogen burning which are needed to explain the abundance patterns seen in multiple populations in massive star clusters. We then calculate the total yield of a population of binary stars with masses, mass ratios, and periods consistent with their distribution in a field population. We show that the overall abundance of this material is enriched in helium, nitrogen, sodium, and aluminum, and depleted in carbon, oxygen, and magnesium, by amounts that are consistent with observations. We also show that such a population of binaries will return approximately 25% of its mass in this ejecta (compared to 4% if all the stars were single), over a characteristic timescale of about 12 Myr. We argue that massive binaries must be seriously considered as a contributor to the source of enriched material needed to explain the multiple populations in massive clusters, since essentially all massive stars are formed in binaries or higher order multiples, massive binaries are primarily formed in clusters, and massive binaries naturally produce material of the right composition.

 - **Abstract**
 The measurement of the internal rotation of post-main sequence stars using data from space-based photometry missions has demonstrated the need for an efficient angular momentum transport in stellar interiors. So far, no clear solution has emerged and explaining the observed trends remain a challenge for stellar modellers. We aim at constraining both the shape of the internal rotation profile of six Kepler subgiants studied in details in 2014 and the properties of the missing angular momentum transport process acting in stellar interiors from MCMC inversions of the internal rotation. We apply a new MCMC inversion technique to existing Kepler subgiant targets and test various shapes of the internal rotation profile of all six original subgiants observed in 2014. We also constrain the limitations on the number of free parameters that can be used in the MCMC inversion, showing the limitations in the amount of information in the seismic data. First, we show that large-scale fossil magnetic fields are not able to explain the internal rotation of subgiants, similarly to what was determined from detailed studies of Kepler red giants. We are also able to constrain the location of the transition in the internal rotation profile for the most evolved stars in the available set of subgiants. We find that some of them exhibit a transition located close to the border of the helium core while one clearly does not. We conclude that it might be possible that various processes might be at play to explain our observations, but that revealing the physical nature of the angular momentum process will require a consistent detailed modelling of all subgiants available, particularly the least evolved. In addition, increasing the number of stars for which such inferences are possible (e.g. with the future PLATO mission) is paramount given the key role they play in validating transport process candidates.
#### Title:
          Introducing two improved methods for approximating radiative cooling in hydrodynamical simulations of accretion discs

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of many astrophysical systems depends strongly on the balance between heating and cooling, in particular star formation in giant molecular clouds and the evolution of young protostellar systems. Protostellar discs are susceptible to the gravitational instability, which can play a key role in their evolution and in planet formation. The strength of the instability depends on the rate at which the system loses thermal energy. To study the evolution of these systems, we require radiative cooling approximations because full radiative transfer is generally too expensive to be coupled to hydrodynamical models. Here we present two new approximate methods for computing radiative cooling that make use of the polytropic cooling approximation. This approach invokes the assumption that each parcel of gas is located within a spherical pseudo-cloud which can then be used to approximate the optical depth. The first method combines the methods introduced by Stamatellos et al. and Lombardi et al. to overcome the limitations of each method at low and high optical depths respectively. The second, the "Modified Lombardi" method, is specifically tailored for self-gravitating discs. This modifies the scale height estimate from the method of Lombardi et al. using the analytical scale height for a self-gravitating disc. We show that the Modified Lombardi method provides an excellent approximation for the column density in a fragmenting disc, a regime in which the existing methods fail to recover the clumps and spiral structures. We therefore recommend this improved radiative cooling method for more realistic simulations of self-gravitating discs.

          Exploration of morphological coherence in open clusters with "core-shell'' structure

 - **Abstract**
 The study of their morphological coherence allows for a better understanding of the morphological evolution of open clusters. We employ the ellipsoid fitting method to delineate the 3D spatial structure of the sample clusters while using the morphological dislocation (MD) defined in our previous work and the ellipticity ratio (ER) of the clusters' inner and outer structures to characterize the morphological coherence of the sample clusters. The results show an inverse correlation between the ER of the sample clusters and the number of their members, indicating that sample clusters with much more elliptical external morphology than internal shape have generally a large number of members. Meanwhile, a slight shrinking of the MD of the sample clusters with their members' number may shed light on the significant role of the gravitational binding of the sample clusters in maintaining their morphological stability. Moreover, there are no correlations between the MD and ER of the sample clusters and their age. They are also not significantly correlated with the X-axis, the Y-axis, their orbital eccentricities, and the radial and vertical forces on them. However, the ER of the sample clusters displays some fluctuations in the distributions between it and the above covariates, implying that the morphologies of the sample clusters are sensitive to the external environment if sample effects are not taken into account. Finally, the analysis of the 3D spatial shapes of sample clusters with a small ER or a large ER demonstrates that the number of members lays an important foundation for forming a dense internal system for sample clusters. At the same time, the MD of the sample clusters can serve well as an indicator of their morphological stability, which is built on a certain amount of member stars.

          JADES -- The small blue bump in GN-z11: insights into the nuclear region of a galaxy at z=10.6

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of continuum excess in the rest-frame UV between 3000 Å and 3550 Å in the JWST/NIRSpec spectrum of GN-z11, a galaxy hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN) at z = 10.603. The shape of the continuum excess resembles a Balmer continuum but has a break around 3546 Å in the rest frame, which is 100 Å bluewards to the Balmer limit at 3646 Å. A Balmer continuum model alone cannot fit the spectrum, implying a different origin for the continuum excess. The absence of the Balmer jump indicates an electron temperature of $\sim 3\times 10^4$ K, which is significantly higher than the temperature of $T_{e}({\rm O^{2+}}) \approx 1.3\times 10^{4}$ K inferred from [OIII]$\lambda 4363$. The temperature difference must result from mixing of different ionized regions: the Balmer emission mainly arises from dense and hot clouds in the Broad Line Region, close to the accreting black hole, whereas the forbidden lines originate from less dense and colder gas in the host galaxy (although these ionized regions are kinematically similar in GN-z11 due to its small BH mass). We propose a potential explanation for the observed continuum excess to come from a complex of FeII emission, which shows a characteristic jump bluewards to the Balmer limit as previously seen in the spectra of many lower-redshift quasars. Through comparisons with Cloudy models, we show an Fe abundance or an overall metallicity above $\sim 1/3$ solar is likely needed. Besides the FeII emission, part of the small blue bump might also be associated with an OIII Bowen fluorescent line, a line often enhanced in dense AGN-ionized gas. Finally, the spectrum provides further evidence against Wolf-Rayet or massive stars dominating the nebular emission in GN-z11.
