 - **Abstract**
 We have studied a star-forming complex S193 using near-infrared (NIR) observations and other archival data covering optical to radio wavelengths. We identified stellar clusters in the complex using the NIR photometric data and estimated the membership and distance of the clusters. Using the mid-infrared (MIR) and far-infrared (FIR) images, the distribution of the dust emission around H\,{\sc ii} regions is traced in the complex. The $Herschel$ column density and temperature maps analysis reveal 16 cold dust clumps in the complex. The H$\alpha$ image and 1.4 GHz radio continuum emission map are employed to study the ionised gas distribution and infer the spectral type and the dynamical age of each H\,{\sc ii} region/ionised clump in the complex. The $^{12}$CO(J =3$-$2) and $^{13}$CO(J =1$-$0) molecular line data hint at the presence of two velocity components around [-43,-46] and [-47,-50] km/s, and their spatial distribution reveals two overlapping zones toward the complex. By investigating the immediate surroundings of the central cluster [BDS2003]57 and the pressure calculations, we suggest that the feedback from the massive stars seems responsible for the observed velocity gradient and might have triggered the formation of the central cluster [BDS2003]57.}
#### Revealing the Chemical Structure of the Magellanic Clouds with APOGEE.  II. Abundance Gradients of the Large Magellanic Cloud
 - **Authors:** Joshua T. Povick, David L. Nidever, Steven R. Majewski, Doug Geisler, Maria-Rosa L. Cioni, Yuxi (Lucy)Lu, Ricardo Muñoz, Guy S. Stringfellow, Andrés Almeida, Penélope Longa-Peña, Richard R. Lane, Alexandre Roman-Lopes

 - **Abstract**
 We present the abundance gradients of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) for 25 elemental abundance ratios and their respective temporal evolution as well as age-[X/Fe] trends using 6130 LMC field red giant branch (RGB) stars observed by SDSS-IV / APOGEE-2S. APOGEE is a high resolution ($R$ $\sim$22,500) $H$-band spectroscopic survey that gathered data on the LMC with broad radial and azimuthal coverage out to $\sim$10\degr. The calculated overall metallicity gradient of the LMC with no age binning is $-$0.0380 $\pm$ 0.0022 dex/kpc. We also find that many of the abundance gradients show a U-shaped trend as functions of age. This trend is marked by a flattening of the gradient but then a general steepening at more recent times. The extreme point at which all these gradients (with the U-shaped trend) begin to steepen is $\gtrsim$2 Gyr ago. In addition, some of the age-[X/Fe] trends show an increase starting a few Gyr before the extreme point in the gradient evolutions. A subset of the age-[X/Fe] trends also show maxima concurrent with the gradients' extreme points, further pinpointing a major event in the history of the LMC $\sim$2 Gyr ago. This time frame is consistent with a previously proposed interaction between the Magellanic Clouds suggesting that this is most likely the cause of the distinct trend in the gradients and age-[X/Fe] trends.
#### Population synthesis of exoplanets accounting for orbital variations due  to stellar evolution
 - **Authors:** A.S. Andriushin, S.B. Popov
 - **Subjects:** Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12635
 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12635
 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, the evolution of exoplanet orbits at the late stages of stellar evolution is studied by the method of population synthesis. The evolution of stars is traced from the Main Sequence stage to the white dwarf stage. The MESA package is used to calculate evolutionary tracks. The statistics of absorbed, ejected, and surviving planets by the time of the transformation of parent stars into white dwarfs are calculated taking into account the change in the rate of star formation in the Galaxy over the entire time of its existence. Planets around stars in the range of initial masses 1-8 $M_\odot$ are considered since less massive stars do not have time to leave the Main Sequence during the lifetime of the Galaxy, and more massive ones do not lead to the formation of white dwarfs. It is shown that with the initial $a$~--~$M_\mathrm{pl}$ distribution of planets adopted in this work, most (about 60\%) of the planets born from stars in the mass range under study are absorbed by their parent stars at the giant stage. A small fraction of the planets (less than one percent) are ejected from their systems because of the mass loss due to the stellar wind. The estimated number of ejected planets with masses ranging from 0.04 Earth masses to 13 Jupiter masses in the Milky way is approximately equal to 300 million.
#### Dust Emission and Dynamics

 - **Abstract**
 When viewed from Earth, most of what we observe of a comet is dust. The influence of solar radiation pressure on the trajectories of dust particles depends on their cross-section to mass ratio. Hence solar radiation pressure acts like a mass spectrometer inside a cometary tail. The appearances of cometary dust tails have long been studied to obtain information on the dust properties, such as characteristic particle size and initial velocity when entering the tail. Over the past two decades, several spacecraft missions to comets have enabled us to study the dust activity of their targets at much greater resolution than is possible with a telescope on Earth or in near-Earth space, and added detail to the results obtained by the spacecraft visiting comet 1P/Halley in 1986. We now know that the dynamics of dust in the inner cometary coma is complex and includes a significant fraction of particles that will eventually fall back to the surface. The filamented structure of the near-surface coma is thought to result from a combination of topographic focussing of the gas flow, inhomogeneous distribution of activity across the surface, and projection effects. It is possible that some larger-than-centimetre debris contains ice when lifted from the surface, which can affect its motion. Open questions remain regarding the microphysics of the process that leads to the detachment and lifting of dust from the surface, the evolution of the dust while travelling away from the nucleus, and the extent to which information on the nucleus activity can be retrieved from remote observations of the outer coma and tail.
#### A determination of the LMC dark matter subhalo mass using the MW halo  stars in its gravitational wake
 - **Authors:** K. J. Fushimi, M. E. Mosquera, M. Dominguez

 - **Abstract**
 Our goal is to study the gravitational effects caused by the passage of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) in its orbit on the stellar halo of the Milky Way (MW). We employed the Gaia Data Release 3 to construct a halo tracers data set consisting of K-Giant stars and RR-Lyrae variables. Additionally, we have compared the data with a theoretical model to estimate the DM subhalo mass. We have improved the characterisation of the local wake and the collective response due to the LMC orbit. On the other hand, we have estimated for the first time the dark subhalo mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud, of the order of $2\times 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$, comparable to previously reported values in the literature.
