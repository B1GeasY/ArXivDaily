#### Younger age for the oldest magnetic white dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 Sufficiently old white dwarfs cool down through a convective envelope that directly couples their degenerate cores to the surface. Magnetic fields may inhibit this convection by stiffening the criterion for convective instability. We consistently implemented the modified criterion in the stellar evolution code MESA, and computed the cooling of white dwarfs as a function of their mass and magnetic field $B$. In contrast to previous estimates, we find that magnetic fields can significantly change the cooling time $t$ even if they are relatively weak $B^2\ll 8\pi P$, where $P$ is the pressure at the edge of the degenerate core. Fields $B\gtrsim 1\textrm{ MG}$ open a radiative window that decouples the core from the convective envelope, effectively lowering the luminosity to that of a fully radiative white dwarf. We identified a population of observed white dwarfs that are younger by $\Delta t\sim\textrm{Gyr}$ than currently thought due to this magnetic inhibition of convection - comparable to the cooling delay due to carbon-oxygen phase separation. In volume-limited samples, the frequency and strength of magnetic fields increase with age. Accounting for magnetic inhibition is therefore essential for accurate cooling models for cosmic chronology and for determining the origin of the magnetic fields.
#### Where Have All the Sulfur Atoms Gone? Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon as a Possible Sink for the Missing Sulfur in the Interstellar Medium. I. The C--S Band Strengths

 - **Abstract**
 Despite its biogeneic and astrochemical importance, sulfur (S), the 10th most abundant element in the interstellar medium (ISM) with a total abundance of S/H~2.2E-5, largely remains undetected in molecular clouds. Even in the diffuse ISM where S was previously often believed to be fully in the gas phase, in recent years observational evidence has suggested that S may also be appreciably depleted from the gas. What might be the dominant S reservoir in the ISM remains unknown. Solid sulfides like MgS, FeS and SiS_2 are excluded as a major S reservoir due to the undetection of their expected infrared spectral bands in the ISM. In this work, we explore the potential role of sulfurated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules -- PAHs with sulfur heterocycles (PASHs) -- as a sink for the missing S. Utilizing density function theory, we compute the vibrational spectra of 18 representative PASH molecules. It is found that these molecules exhibit a prominent, C--S stretching band at ~10 micron and two relatively weak, C--S deformation bands at 15 and 25 micron that are not mixed with the nominal PAH bands at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3 and 12.7 micron If several parts per million of S (relative to H) are locked up in PAHs, the 10 micron C--S band would be detectable by Spitzer and JWST. To quantitatively explore the amount of S/H depleted in PASHs, detailed comparison of the infrared emission spectra of PASHs with the Spitzer and JWST observations is needed.

 - **Abstract**
 The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) presents a unique environment for pulsar population studies due to its distinct star formation characteristics and proximity to the Milky Way. As part of the TRAPUM (TRAnsients and PUlsars with MeerKAT) Large Survey Project, we are using the core array of the MeerKAT radio telescope (MeerKAT) to conduct a targeted search of the LMC for radio pulsars at L-band frequencies, 856-1712$\,$MHz. The excellent sensitivity of MeerKAT, coupled with a 2-hour integration time, makes the survey 3 times more sensitive than previous LMC radio pulsar surveys. We report the results from the initial four survey pointings which has resulted in the discovery of seven new radio pulsars, increasing the LMC radio pulsar population by 30 per cent. The pulse periods of these new pulsars range from 278 to 1690$\,$ms, and the highest dispersion measure is 254.20$\,$pc$\,$cm$^{-3}$. We searched for, but did not find any significant pulsed radio emission in a beam centred on the SN$\,$1987A remnant, establishing an upper limit of 6.3$\,{\mu}$Jy on its minimum flux density at 1400$\,$MHz.

 - **Abstract**
 Determining the evolutionary stage of stars is crucial for understanding the evolution of exoplanetary systems. In this context, Red Giant Branch (RGB) and Red Clump (RC) stars, stages in the later evolution of stars situated before and after the helium flash, harbor critical clues to unveiling the evolution of planets. The first step in revealing these clues is to confirm the evolutionary stage of the host stars through asteroseismology. However, up to now, host stars confirmed to be RGB or RC stars are extremely rare. In this investigation, we present a comprehensive asteroseismic analysis of two evolved stars, HD 120084 and HD 29399, known to harbor exoplanets, using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We have discovered for the first time that HD 120084 is a Red Clump star in the helium-core burning phase, and confirmed that HD 29399 is a Red Giant Branch star in the hydrogen-shell burning phase. Through the precise measurement of asteroseismic parameters such as $\nu_{max}$, $\Delta\nu$ and $\Delta\Pi_{1}$ we have determined the evolutionary states of these stars and derived their fundamental stellar parameters. The significance of this study lies in the application of automated techniques to measure asymptotic period spacings in red giants, which provides critical insights into the evolutionary outcomes of exoplanet systems. We demonstrate that asteroseismology is a potent tool for probing the internal structures of stars, thereby offering a window into the past and future dynamics of planetary orbits. The presence of a long-period giant planet orbiting HD 120084, in particular, raises intriguing questions about the potential engulfment of inner planets during the host star's expansion, a hypothesis that warrants further investigation.
#### Absence of High-mass Prestellar Cores in the Orion Giant Molecular Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 A fundamental difference between "core-fed" and "clump-fed" star formation theories lies in the existence or absence of high-mass cores at the prestellar stage. However, only a handful of such cores have been observed. Here, different than previous search in distributed star formation regions in the Galactic plane, we search for high-mass prestellar cores in the Orion GMC, by observing the 7 most massive starless cores selected from previous deep continuum surveys. We present ALMA ACA Band 6 and Band 7 continuum and line observations toward the 7 cores, in which we identify 9 dense cores at both bands. The derived maximum core mass is less than 11 Msun, based on different dust temperatures. We find no high-mass prestellar cores in this sample, aligning with the results of previous surveys, thereby challenging the existence of such cores in Orion. Outside Orion, further detailed studies are needed for remaining high-mass prestellar core candidates to confirm their status as massive, starless cores.
#### Optical observations of the Galactic SNR HB9 and H II region G159.2+3.3

 - **Abstract**
 Context. We present multi-wavelength observations of the Galactic SNR HB9 and the H II region G159.2+3.3 apparently projected nearby, in order to study their properties and potential physical connections. Results. HB9 is bright in $\gamma$-rays, but the $\gamma$-ray morphology is centrally filled and most of it is not clearly associated with the surrounding molecular clouds. There is a weak apparent connection of HB9 to the IR bright enclosing shell of G159.2+3.3 in $\gamma$-ray. The diffuse Balmer line has almost identical morphology as the radio emission in G159.2+3.3, indicating they two are thermal in origin. Using medium-band high-resolution optical spectra from selected regions of the southeast (SE) shell of HB9 and G159.2+3.3, we found the radial velocity dispersion of HB9 along the slit is significantly higher than the FWHM of the lines. In contrast, these two values are both smaller and comparable to each other in G159.2+3.3. This indicates that the gas in HB9 may have additional global motion triggered by the SNR shock. The [N II] $\lambda$6583A/H$\alpha$ line ratio of both objects can be interpreted with photo-ionisation by hot stars or low velocity shocks, except for the post-shock region in the SE shell of HB9, where the elevated [N II]/H$\alpha$ line ratio suggests contribution from shock ionisation. The measured electron density from the [S II] 6716/6730 line ratio is significantly lower in the brighter G159.2+3.3 compared to the SE shell of HB9. Conclusions. Our density estimate suggests that G159.2+3.3, although appearing brighter and more compact, is likely located at a much larger distance than HB9, so the two objects have no physical connections, unless the shock compressed gas in HB9 has a significantly lower filling factor.
#### On the distribution of the the near-solar bound dust grains detected with Parker Solar Probe

 - **Abstract**
 Parker Solar Probe (PSP) counts dust impacts in the near-solar region, but modelling effort is needed to understand the dust population's properties. We aim to constrain the dust cloud's properties based on the flux observed by PSP. We develop a forward-model for the bound dust detection rates using the formalism of 6D phase space distribution of the dust. We apply the model to the location table of different PSP's solar encounter groups. We explain some of the near-perihelion features observed in the data as well as the broader characteristic of the dust flux between 0.15 AU and 0.5 AU. We compare the measurements of PSP to the measurements of Solar Orbiter (SolO) near 1 AU to expose the differences between the two spacecraft. We found that the dust flux observed by PSP between 0.15 AU and 0.5 AU in post-perihelia can be explained by dust on bound orbits and is consistent with a broad range of orbital parameters, including dust on circular orbits. However, the dust number density as a function of the heliocentric distance and the scaling of detection efficiency with the relative speed are important to explain the observed flux variation. The data suggest that the slope of differential mass distribution ${\delta}$ is between 0.14 and 0.49. The near-perihelion observations, however, show the flux maxima, which are inconsistent with the circular dust model, and additional effects may play a role. We found indication that the sunward side of PSP is less sensitive to the dust impacts, compared to the other PSP's surfaces. Conclusions. We show that the dust flux on PSP can be explained by non-circular bound dust and the detection capabilities of PSP. The scaling of flux with the impact speed is especially important, and shallower than previously assumed.
