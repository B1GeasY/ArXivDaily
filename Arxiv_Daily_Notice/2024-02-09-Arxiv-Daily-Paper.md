 - **Abstract**
 Galactic archaeology largely relies on precise ages of distant evolved stars in the Milky Way. Nowadays, asteroseismology can deliver ages for many red giants observed with high-cadence, high-precision photometric space missions. Our aim is to quantify age uncertainties of slowly-rotating red giants due to the cumulative effect of their fast rotation during core-hydrogen burning. Their rotation in earlier evolutionary phases caused mixing resulting in heavier helium cores and the prolongation of their main sequence. These rotational effects are usually ignored when age-dating red giants, despite our knowledge of fast rotation for stars with $M\ge1.3\,$M$_\odot$. We use a sample of 490 $\gamma$ Doradus pulsators with precise asteroseismic estimates of their internal rotation rate and with luminosity estimates from Gaia. For this sample, which includes stars rotating from nearly 0 to about 60% of the critical rate, we compute the cumulative effect on the age in their post-main sequence evolution caused by rotational mixing on the main sequence. We use stellar model grids with different physical prescriptions mimicking rotational mixing to assess systematic uncertainties on the age. With respect to non-rotating models, the sample of 490 stars, as red giant progenitors, reveals age differences up to 5% by the time they start hydrogen-shell burning when relying on the theory of rotationally induced diffusive mixing as included in the MIST isochrones. Using rotational mixing based on an advective-diffusive approach including meridional circulation leads to an age shift of 20% by the time of the TRGB. Age-dating of red giants is affected by the cumulative effect of rotational mixing during the main sequence. Such rotationally-induced age shifts should be taken into account in addition to other effects if the aim is to perform Galactic archaeological studies at the highest precision. (abridged)
#### Probability distributions of initial rotation velocities and  core-boundary mixing efficiencies of γ Doradus stars

 - **Abstract**
 The theory the rotational and chemical evolution is incomplete, thereby limiting the accuracy of model-dependent stellar mass and age determinations. The $\gamma$ Doradus pulsators are excellent points of calibration for the current state-of-the-art stellar evolution models, as their gravity modes probe the physical conditions in the deep stellar interior. Yet, individual asteroseismic modelling of these stars is not always possible because of insufficient observed oscillation modes. This paper presents a novel method to derive distributions of the stellar mass, age, core-boundary mixing efficiency and initial rotation rates for $\gamma$ Dor stars. We compute a grid of rotating stellar evolution models covering the entire $\gamma$ Dor instability strip. We then use the observed distributions of the luminosity, effective temperature, buoyancy travel time and near-core rotation frequency of a sample of 539 stars to assign a statistical weight to each of our models. This weight is a measure of how likely the combination of a specific model is. We then compute weighted histograms to derive the most likely distributions of the fundamental stellar properties. We find that the rotation frequency at zero-age main sequence follows a normal distribution, peaking around 25% of the critical Keplerian rotation frequency. The probability-density function for extent of the core-boundary mixing zone, given by a factor $f_{\rm CBM}$ times the local pressure scale height (assuming an exponentially decaying parameterisation) decreases linearly with increasing $f_{\rm CBM}$. Converting the distribution of fractions of critical rotation at the zero-age main sequence to units of d$^{-1}$, we find most F-type stars start the main sequence with a rotation frequency between 0.5 and 2 d$^{-1}$. Regarding the core-boundary mixing efficiency, we find that it is generally weak in this mass regime.

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar medium is threaded by a hierarchy of filaments from large scales (~ 100 pc) to small scales (~ 0.1pc). The masses and lengths of these nested structures may reveal important constraints for cloud formation and evolution, but it is difficult to investigate from an evolutionary perspective using single observations. In this work, we extract simulated molecular clouds from the Cloud Factory galactic-scale ISM suite in combination with 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code POLARIS to investigate how filamentary structure evolves over time. We produce synthetic dust continuum observations in three regions with a series of snapshots and use the Filfinder algorithm to identify filaments in the dust derived column density maps. When the synthetic filaments mass and length are plotted on an M-L plot, we see a scaling relation of $L\propto M^{0.45}$ similar to that seen in observations, and find that the filaments are thermally supercritical. Projection effects systematically affect the masses and lengths measured for the filaments, and are particularly severe in crowded regions. In the filament Mass-Length (M-L) diagram we identify three main evolutionary mechanisms: accretion, segmentation, and dispersal. In particular we find that the filaments typically evolve from smaller to larger masses in the observational M-L plane, indicating the dominant role of accretion in filament evolution. Moreover, we find a potential correlation between line mass and filament growth rate. Once filaments are actively star forming they then segment into smaller sections, or are dispersed by internal or external forces.

 - **Abstract**
 Young stellar clusters are predominantly the hub of star formation and hence, ideal to perform comprehensive studies over the least explored sub-stellar regime. Various unanswered questions like the mass distribution in brown dwarf regime and the effect of diverse cluster environment on brown dwarf formation efficiency still plague the scientific community. The nearby young cluster, IC 1396 with its feedback-driven environment, is ideal to conduct such study. In this paper we adopt a multi-wavelength approach, using deep Subaru HSC, Gaia DR3, Pan-STARRS, UKIDSS/2MASS photometry and machine learning techniques to identify the cluster members complete down to $\sim$ 0.03 M$_{\odot}$ in the central 22$^{\prime}$ area of IC 1396. We identify 458 cluster members including 62 brown dwarfs which are used to determine mass distribution in the region. We obtain a star-to-brown dwarf ratio of $\sim$ 6 for a stellar mass range 0.03 -- 1 M$_{\odot}$ in the studied cluster. The brown dwarf fraction is observed to increase across the cluster as radial distance from the central OB-stars increases. This study also compiles 15 young stellar clusters to check the variation of star-to-brown dwarf ratio relative to stellar density and UV flux ranging within 4-2500 stars pc$^{-2}$ and 0.7-7.3 G$_{0}$ respectively. The brown dwarf fraction is observed to increase with stellar density but the results about the influence of incident UV flux are inconclusive within this range. This is the deepest study of IC 1396 as of yet and it will pave the way to understand various aspects of brown dwarfs using spectroscopic observations in future.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the circumgalactic medium (CGM) for eight commonly-used cosmological codes in the AGORA collaboration. The codes are calibrated to use identical initial conditions, cosmology, heating and cooling, and star formation thresholds, but each evolves with its own unique code architecture and stellar feedback implementation. Here, we analyze the results of these simulations in terms of the structure, composition, and phase dynamics of the CGM. We show properties such as metal distribution, ionization levels, and kinematics are effective tracers of the effects of the different code feedback and implementation methods, and as such they can be highly divergent between simulations. This is merely a fiducial set of models, against which we will in the future compare multiple feedback recipes for each code. Nevertheless, we find that the large parameter space these simulations establish can help disentangle the different variables that affect observable quantities in the CGM, e.g., showing that abundances for ions with higher ionization energy are more strongly determined by the simulation's metallicity, while abundances for ions with lower ionization energy are more strongly determined by the gas density and temperature.
#### Investigating Performance Trends of Simulated Real-time Solar Flare  Predictions: The Impacts of Training Windows, Data Volumes, and the Solar  Cycle

 - **Abstract**
 This study explores the behavior of machine learning-based flare forecasting models deployed in a simulated operational environment. Using Georgia State University's Space Weather Analytics for Solar Flares benchmark dataset (Angryk et al. 2020a,b), we examine the impacts of training methodology and the solar cycle on decision tree, support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron performance. We implement our classifiers using three temporal training windows: stationary, rolling, and expanding. The stationary window trains models using a single set of data available before the first forecasting instance, which remains constant throughout the solar cycle. The rolling window trains models using data from a constant time interval before the forecasting instance, which moves with the solar cycle. Finally, the expanding window trains models using all available data before the forecasting instance. For each window, a number of input features (1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 120) and temporal sizes (5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20 months) were tested. To our surprise, we found that for a 20-month window, skill scores were comparable regardless of the window type, feature count, and classifier selected. Furthermore, reducing the size of this window only marginally decreased stationary and rolling window performance. This implies that, given enough data, a stationary window can be chosen over other window types, eliminating the need for model retraining. Lastly, a moderately strong positive correlation was found to exist between a model's false positive rate and the solar X-ray background flux. This suggests that the solar cycle phase has a considerable influence on forecasting.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal interactions between moons and planets can have major effects on the orbits, spins, and thermal evolution of the moons. In the Saturn system, tidal dissipation in the planet transfers angular momentum from Saturn to the moons, causing them to migrate outwards. The rate of migration is determined by the mechanism of dissipation within the planet, which is closely tied to the planet's uncertain structure. We review current knowledge of giant planet internal structure and evolution, which has improved thanks to data from the \textit{Juno} and \textit{Cassini} missions. We discuss general principles of tidal dissipation, describing both equilibrium and dynamical tides, and how dissipation can occur in a solid core or a fluid envelope. Finally, we discuss the possibility of resonance locking, whereby a moon can lock into resonance with a planetary oscillation mode, producing enhanced tidal migration relative to classical theories, and possibly explaining recent measurements of moon migration rates.

 - **Abstract**
 We use an infrared dataset captured between 1984 and 2017 using several instruments and observatories to report five rare equatorial disturbances that completely altered the appearance of Jupiter's Equatorial Zone (EZ): the clearance of tropospheric clouds revealed a new 5-$\mu$m-bright band encircling the planet at the equator, accompanied by large 5-$\mu$m-bright filaments. Three events were observed in ground-based images in 1973, 1979 and 1992. We report and characterize for the first time the entire evolution of two new episodes of this unusual EZ state that presented their maximum 5-$\mu$m-brightness in December 1999 and February 2007, coinciding with a brown coloration south of the equator and with large bluish filaments and white plumes in the northern EZ at visible wavelengths. We characterize their typical infrared-bright lifetimes of 12-18 months, with possible periodicities of 6-8 or 13-14 years. We predict that a full-scale equatorial disturbance could occur in 2019-21.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of protoplanetary discs have revealed dust rings which are likely due to the presence of pressure bumps in the disc. Because these structures tend to trap drifting pebbles, it has been proposed that pressure bumps may play an important role in the planet formation process. In this paper, we investigate the orbital evolution of a $0.1$ $M_\oplus$ protoplanet embedded in a pressure bump using 2-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary discs consisting of gas and pebbles. We examine the role of thermal forces generated by the pebble accretion-induced heat release, taking into account the feedback between luminosity and eccentricity. We also study the effect of the pebble-scattered flow on the planet's orbital evolution. Due to accumulation of pebbles at the pressure bump, the planet's accretion luminosity is high enough to induce significant eccentricity growth through thermal forces. Accretion luminosity is also responsible for vortex formation at the planet position through baroclinic effects, which cause the planet escape from the dust ring if dust feedback onto the gas is neglected. Including the effect of the dust back-reaction leads to weaker vortices, which enable the planet to remain close to the pressure maximum on an eccentric orbit. Simulations in which the planet mass is allowed to increase as a consequence of pebble accretion resulted in the formation of giant planet cores with mass in the range $5-20$ $M_\oplus$ over $\sim 2\times 10^4$ yrs. This occurs for moderate values of the Stokes number $St \approx 0.01$ such that the pebble drift velocity is not too high and the dust ring mass not too small. Our results suggest that pressure bumps mays be preferred locations for the formation of giant planets, but this requires a moderate level of grain growth within the disc.

 - **Abstract**
 The deposition of energy and momentum by supernova explosions has been subject to numerous studies in the past few decades. However, while there has been some work that focused on the transition from the adiabatic to the radiative stage of a supernova remnant (SNR), the late radiative stage and merging with the interstellar medium (ISM) have received little attention. Here, we use three-dimensional, hydrodynamic simulations, focusing on the evolution of SNRs during the radiative phase, considering a wide range of physical explosion parameters ($n_{\text{H, ISM}} \in \left[0.1, 100\right] \text{cm}^{-3}$ and $E_{\text{SN}} \in \left[1, 14\right]\times 10^{51} \text{erg}$). We find that the radiative phase can be subdivided in four stages: A pressure driven snowplow phase during which the hot overpressurized bubble gas is evacuated and pushed into the cold shell, a momentum conserving snowplow phase which is accompanied by a broadening of the shell, an implosion phase where cold material from the back of the shell is flooding the central vacuum and a final cloud phase, during which the imploding gas is settling as a central, compact overdensity. The launching timescale for the implosion ranges from a few 100 kyr to a few Myr, while the cloud formation timescale ranges from a few to about 10 Myr. The highly chemically enriched clouds can become massive ($M_{\text{cl}} \sim 10^3 - 10^4 \, \text{M}_{\odot}$) and self-gravitating within a few Myr after their formation, providing an attractive, novel pathway for supernova induced star and planet formation in the ISM.
#### Towards a holistic magnetic braking model -- II: explaining several  long-term internal- and surface-spin properties of solar-like stars and the  Sun

 - **Abstract**
 We extend our model of magnetic braking (MB) from fully convective M-dwarfs (FCMDs) to explain the surface and internal spin $P_\mathrm{spin}$ evolution of partly convective dwarfs (PCDs) starting from disc-dispersal stage to main-sequence turnoff. In our model, the spin of the core is governed by shear at the core-envelope boundary while the spin of the envelope is governed by MB and shear. We show that (1) the most massive FCMDs experience a stronger spin-down than PCDs and less massive FCMDs; (2) the stalled spin-down and enhanced activity of K-dwarfs and the pileup of G-dwarfs older than a few Gyr are stellar-structure- and MB-dependent, and weakly dependent on core-envelope coupling effects; (3) our empirical expression of the core-envelope convergence time-scale $\tau_\mathrm{converge}(M_\ast,\,P_\mathrm{spin})$ between a few 10 to 100 Myr is strongly dependent on stellar structure and weakly dependent on MB strength and shear, where fast and massive rotators achieve corotation earlier; (4) our estimates of the surface magnetic fields are in general agreement with observations and our wind mass loss evolution explains the weak winds from the solar analog $\pi^1$ UMa; (5) the massive young Sun theory as a solution to the faint young Sun problem, which states that the early Sun was sufficiently more massive to maintain liquid water on Earth when the Sun's luminosity would have been about 30 percent lower, can likely be ruled out because the maximum mass lost by winds from our Sun with our model is about $0.001M_\odot$, an order of magnitude smaller than required to solve the problem with this theory.

 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming Square Kilometer Array (SKA) will set a new standard regarding data volume generated by an astronomical instrument, which is likely to challenge widely adopted data analysis tools that scale inadequately with the data size. This study aims to develop a new source detection and characterization method for massive radio astronomical datasets by adapting modern deep-learning object detection techniques. These approaches have proved their efficiency on complex computer vision tasks, and we seek to identify their specific strengths and weaknesses when applied to astronomical data. We introduce YOLO-CIANNA, a highly customized deep-learning object detector designed specifically for astronomical datasets. This paper presents the method and describes all the low-level adaptations required to address the specific challenges of radio-astronomical images. We demonstrate this method's capabilities using simulated 2D continuum images from the SKAO SDC1 dataset. Our method outperforms every other published result on the specific SDC1 dataset. Using the SDC1 metric, we improve the challenge-winning score by +139\% and the score of the only other post-challenge participation by +61\%. Our catalog has a detection purity of 94\% while detecting 40 to 60 \% more sources than previous top-score results. The trained model can also be forced to reach 99\% purity in post-process and still detect 10 to 30\% more sources than the other top-score methods. It is also capable of real-time detection, with a peak prediction speed of 500 images of 512x512 pixels per second on a single GPU. YOLO-CIANNA achieves state-of-the-art detection and characterization results on the simulated SDC1 dataset. The method is open source and included in the wider CIANNA framework. We provide scripts to train and apply this method to the SDC1 dataset in the CIANNA repository.
