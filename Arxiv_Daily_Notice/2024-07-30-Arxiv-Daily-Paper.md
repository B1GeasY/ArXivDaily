 - **Abstract**
 The maximum energy of electrons in supernova remnant (SNR) shocks is typically limited by radiative losses, where the synchrotron cooling time equals the acceleration time. The low speed of shocks in a dense medium increases the acceleration time, leading to lower maximum electron energies and fainter X-ray emissions. However, in Kepler's SNR, an enhanced electron acceleration, which proceeds close to the Bohm limit, occurs in the north of its shell, where the shock is slowed by a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). To investigate whether this scenario still holds at smaller scales, we analyzed the temporal evolution of the X-ray synchrotron flux in filamentary structures, using the two deepest Chandra/ACIS X-ray observations, performed in 2006 and 2014. We examined spectra from different filaments, we measured their proper motion and calculated the acceleration to synchrotron time-scale ratios. The interaction with the turbulent and dense northern CSM induces competing effects on electron acceleration: on one hand, turbulence reduces the electron mean free path enhancing the acceleration efficiency, on the other hand, lower shock velocities increase the acceleration time-scale. In most filaments, these effects compensate each other, but in one region the acceleration time-scale exceeds the synchrotron time-scale, resulting in a significant decrease in nonthermal X-ray emission from 2006 to 2014, indicating fading synchrotron emission. Our findings provide a coherent understanding of the different regimes of electron acceleration observed in Kepler's SNR through various diagnostics.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemistry of phosphorus (31P) in space is particularly significant due to the key role it plays in biochemistry on Earth. Utilising radio and infrared spectroscopic observations, several key phosphorus-containing molecules have been detected in interstellar clouds, circumstellar shells, and even extragalactic sources. Among these, phosphorus nitride (PN) was the first P-bearing molecule detected in space, and still is the species detected in the largest number of sources. Phosphorus oxide (PO) and phosphine (PH3) were also crucial species due to their role both in chemical networks and in forming biogenic compounds. The still limited high-angular resolution observations performed so far are shading light on the geometrical distribution of these molecules, which represent crucial insights on their formation processes. Observations have also highlighted the challenges and complexities associated with detecting and understanding phosphorus chemistry in space, owing to the low elemental abundance of P relative to other elements. This review article provides a state-of-art picture of the observational results obtained so far on phosphorus compounds in the interstellar medium. Special attention is given to star-forming regions, and to their implications for our understanding of prebiotic chemistry and the potential for life beyond Earth. Our knowledge of the dominant formation and destruction pathways of the most abundant species has improved, but critical questions remain open, among which: what is (are) the main phosphorus carrier(s) in space? Upcoming facilities will offer new opportunities to both detect new phosphorus-bearing molecules and enlarge the number of sources in which the chemistry of P can be studied. The synergy between observations, models, laboratory experiments, and computational works is mandatory to progress in this field.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic outflows driven by star formation or active galactic nuclei are typically formed by multi-phase gas whose temperature spans over 4 orders of magnitude. Probing the different outflow components requires multi-wavelength observations and long exposure times, especially in the distant Universe. So far, most of the high-z studies have focused on a single gas phase, but this kind of analysis may potentially miss a non-negligible fraction of the total outflowing gas content. In this work, we analyze the spatially resolved rest-frame UV and optical emission from HZ4, the highest redshift main sequence star-forming galaxy having a detected [C II] outflow, which traces the neutral gas component. Our goal is to study the ionized interstellar medium in the galaxy and the properties of the ionized outflow as traced by the [O III]$\lambda$5007Å and H$\alpha$ emission lines. We exploit JWST/NIRSpec observations in the integral field spectroscopy mode to investigate the galaxy properties by making use of the brightest rest-frame optical emission lines. Their high spectral and spatial resolution allows us to trace the ionized outflow from broad line wings and spatially resolve it. We also re-analyze the [C II] ALMA data to compare the neutral atomic and ionized outflow morphologies, masses, and energetics. We find that the system consists of a galaxy merger, instead of a rotating disk as originally inferred from low-resolution [C II] observations, and hosts an extended ionized outflow. The ionized outflow is being launched from a region hosting an intense burst of star formation and extends over 4 kpc from the launch site. The neutral and ionized outflows are almost co-spatial, but the mass loading factor in the ionized gas phase is two orders of magnitude smaller than in the neutral phase, as found for other lower redshift multi-phase outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results from an extensive follow-up campaign of the Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) ASASSN-15oi spanning $\delta t \sim 10 - 3000$ d, offering an unprecedented window into the multiwavelength properties of a TDE during its first $\approx 8$ years of evolution. ASASSN-15oi is one of the few TDEs with strong detections at X-ray, optical/UV, and radio wavelengths and featured two delayed radio flares at $\delta t \sim 180$ d and $\delta t \sim 1400$ d. Our observations at $> 1400$ d reveal an absence of thermal X-rays, a late-time variability in the non-thermal X-ray emission, and sharp declines in the non-thermal X-ray and radio emission at $\delta t \sim 2800$ d and $\sim 3000$ d, respectively. The UV emission shows no significant evolution at $>400$ d and remains above the pre-TDE level. We show that a cooling envelope model can explain the thermal emission consistently across all epochs. We also find that a scenario involving episodic ejection of material due to stream-stream collisions is conducive to explaining the first radio flare. Given the peculiar spectral and temporal evolution of the late-time emission, however, constraining the origins of the second radio flare and the non-thermal X-rays remains challenging. Our study underscores the critical role of long-term, multiwavelength follow-up.
#### The winds, metallicity, rotational velocities and mass loss rate of the hot, contact binary TU Muscae (HD100213)

 - **Abstract**
 A model of the TU Muscae binary system has been developed by a study of 23 SWP spectrophotometric images obtained with the IUE satellite telescope and downloaded from the IUE Archive. The images are well distributed in Keplerian orbital phase thereby permitting a simultaneous fitting of the C IV wind-line profile by the SEI method and the light curve for the same bandpass by means of a program similar to that of Wilson and Devinney. The result is a set of parameters characterizing the physical and geometric properties of the wind envelopes surrounding the stars. Surprisingly, there is no evidence for a P Cygni profile or strong, distinguishable shock front in the system, as has been found for similar investigations of EM Carinae and HD159176. This is probably a result of the contact nature of the binary and the high temperature environment of such a shock. That is, most of the carbon ions in the shock are more highly ionized. Based on the parameters for the SEI fit to the C IV profile, the value for the ionization fraction of C IV in the wind was calculated to be 10-4. With this value, the mass loss rate calculated from two independent equations, was found to be about 10-6 solar masses/yr. The line blanketing or metallicity was found to be erratically variable with orbital phase and time, indicating a variable amount of fast moving, dense clouds in the winds and/or a great amount of turbulence. The meaning of rotational velocities for the stars is problematic and depends on what point on the photospheres one is considering.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of atmospheric heating in the cool, magnetic white dwarf GD 356 remains unsolved nearly 40 years after its discovery. This once idiosyncratic star with $T_{\rm eff}\approx7500$ K, yet Balmer lines in Zeeman-split emission is now part of a growing class of white dwarfs exhibiting similar features, and which are tightly clustered in the HR diagram suggesting an intrinsic power source. This paper proposes that convective motions associated with an internal dynamo can power electric currents along magnetic field lines that heat the atmosphere via Ohmic dissipation. Such currents would require a dynamo driven by core $^{22}$Ne distillation, and would further corroborate magnetic field generation in white dwarfs by this process. The model predicts that the heating will be highest near the magnetic poles, and virtually absent toward the equator, in agreement with observations. This picture is also consistent with the absence of X-ray or extreme ultraviolet emission, because the resistivity would decrease by several orders of magnitude at the typical coronal temperatures. The proposed model suggests that i) DAHe stars are mergers with enhanced $^{22}$Ne that enables distillation and may result in significant cooling delays; and ii) any mergers that distill neon will generate magnetism and chromospheres. The predicted chromospheric emission is consistent with the two known massive DQe white dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present deep, sub-arcsecond ($\sim$2000 AU) resolution ALMA 0.82 mm observations of the former high-mass prestellar core candidate G11.92-0.61 MM2, recently shown to be an $\sim$500 AU-separation protobinary. Our observations show that G11.92-0.61 MM2, located in the G11.92-0.61 protocluster, lies on a filamentary structure traced by 0.82 mm continuum and N$_2$H$^+$(4-3) emission. The N$_2$H$^+$(4-3) spectra are multi-peaked, indicative of multiple velocity components along the line of sight. To analyse the gas kinematics, we performed pixel-by-pixel Gaussian decomposition of the N$_2$H$^+$ spectra using SCOUSEPY and hierarchical clustering of the extracted velocity components using ACORNS. Seventy velocity- and position-coherent clusters (called "trees") are identified in the N$_2$H$^+$-emitting gas, with the 8 largest trees accounting for >60% of the fitted velocity components. The primary tree, with $\sim$20% of the fitted velocity components, displays a roughly north-south velocity gradient along the filamentary structure traced by the 0.82 mm continuum. Analysing a $\sim$0.17 pc-long substructure, we interpret its velocity gradient of $\sim$10.5 km s$^{-1}$pc$^{-1}$ as tracing filamentary accretion towards MM2 and estimate a mass inflow rate of $\sim$1.8$\times10^{-4}$ to 1.2$\times10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Based on the recent detection of a bipolar molecular outflow associated with MM2, accretion onto the protobinary is ongoing, likely fed by the larger-scale filamentary accretion flows. If 50% of the filamentary inflow reaches the protostars, each member of the protobinary would attain a mass of 8 M$_\odot$ within $\sim1.6\times$10$^5$ yr, comparable to the combined timescale of the 70 $\mu$m- and MIR-weak phases derived for ATLASGAL-TOP100 massive clumps using chemical clocks.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar active regions (ARs) are the main sources of flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). NOAA AR 12089, which emerged on 2014 June 10, produced two C-class flares accompanied by CMEs within five hours after its emergence. When producing the two eruptive flares, the total unsigned magnetic flux ($\Phi_{\text{AR}}$) and magnetic free energy ($E_f$) of the AR are much smaller than the common CME-producing ARs. Why can this extremely small AR produce eruptive flares so early? We compare the AR magnetic environment for the eruptive flares to that for the largest confined flare from the AR. Besides the $\Phi_{\text{AR}}$ and $E_f$, we calculate the ratio between the mean characteristic twist parameter ($\alpha_{\text{FPIL}}$) within the flaring polarity inversion line (FPIL) region and $\Phi_{\text{AR}}$, a parameter considering both background magnetic field constraint and non-potentiality of the core region, for the three flares. We find higher $\alpha_{\text{FPIL}}/{\Phi_{\text{AR}}}$ values during the eruptive flares than during the confined flare. Furthermore, we compute the decay index along the polarity inversion line, revealing values of 1.69, 3.45, and 0.98 before the two eruptive and the confined flares, respectively. Finally, nonlinear force-free field extrapolation indicates that a flux rope was repeatedly formed along the FPIL before eruptive flares, which ejected out and produced CMEs. No flux rope was found before the confined flare. Our research suggests that even a newly emerged, extremely small AR can produce eruptive flares if it has sufficiently weak background field constraint and strong non-potentiality in the core region.

 - **Abstract**
 Herschel surveys have found large numbers of sources with red far-IR colours, and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) rising from 250 to 500$\mu$m: 500 risers. The nature and role of these sources is not fully understood. We here present Submillimeter Array (SMA) interferometric imaging at 200 GHz of a complete sample of five 500 risers with F500 $>$ 44 mJy selected within a 4.5 square degree region of the XMMLSS field. These observations can resolve the separate components of multiple sources and allow cross identification at other wavelengths using the extensive optical-to-IR data in this field. Of our five targets we find that two are likely gravitationally lensed, two are multiple sources, and one an isolated single source. Photometric redshifts, using optical-to-IR data and far-IR/submm data, suggest they lie at redshifts $z \sim 2.5 - 3.5$. Star formation rates and stellar masses estimated from the SEDs show that the majority of our sources lie on the star-formation rate-stellar mass `main sequence', though with outliers both above and below this relation. Of particular interest is our most multiple source which consists of three submm emitters and one submm-undetected optical companion within a 7 arcsecond region, all with photometric redshifts $\sim$ 3. One of the submm emitters in this group lies above the `main sequence', while the optical companion lies well below the relation, and has an estimated stellar mass of 3.3$\pm 1.3 \times$10$^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$. We suggest this object is a forming brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in the process of accreting actively star forming companions.

 - **Abstract**
 A rich inventory of complex organic molecules (COMs) has been observed in high abundances in the gas phase toward Class 0 protostars. These molecules are suggested to be formed in ices and sublimate in the warm inner envelope close to the protostar. However, only the most abundant COM, methanol (CH3OH), has been firmly detected in ices before the era of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Now it is possible to detect the interstellar ices of other COMs and constrain their ice column densities quantitatively. We aim to determine the column densities of several oxygen-bearing COMs (O-COMs) in both gas and ice for two low-mass protostellar sources, NGC 1333 IRAS 2A and B1-c, as case studies in our JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS+) program. By comparing the column density ratios w.r.t. CH3OH between both phases measured in the same sources, we can probe into the evolution of COMs from ice to gas in the early stages of star formation. We are able to fit the fingerprints range of COM ices between 6.8 and 8.8 um in the JWST/MIRI-MRS spectra of B1-c using similar components as recently used for IRAS 2A. We claim detection of CH4, OCN-, HCOO-, HCOOH, CH3CHO, C2H5OH, CH3OCH3, CH3OCHO, and CH3COCH3 in B1-c, and upper limits are estimated for SO2, CH3COOH, and CH3CN. The comparison of O-COM ratios w.r.t CH3OH between ice and gas shows two different cases. 1) the column density ratios of CH3OCHO and CH3OCH3 match well between the two phases, which may be attributed to a direct inheritance from ice to gas or strong chemical links with CH3OH. 2) the ice ratios of CH3CHO and C2H5OH w.r.t. CH3OH are higher than the gas ratios by 1-2 orders of magnitudes. This difference can be explained by the gas-phase reprocessing following sublimation, or different spatial distributions of COMs in the envelope.

 - **Abstract**
 We used the dendrogram algorithm to decompose the surface density distributions of stars into hierarchical structures. These structures were tied to the multiscale structures of star clusters. A similar power-law for the mass-size relation of star clusters measured at different scales suggests a self-similar structure of star clusters. We used the minimum spanning tree method to measure the separations between clusters and gas clumps in each massive star-forming region. The separations between clusters, between clumps, and between clusters and clumps were comparable, which indicates that the evolution from clump to embedded cluster proceeds in isolation and locally, and does not affect the surrounding objects significantly. By comparing the mass functions of the ATLASGAL clumps and the identified embedded clusters, we confirm that a constant star formation efficiency of $\approx$ 0.33 can be a typical value for the ATLASGAL clumps.
