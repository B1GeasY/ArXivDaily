 - **Abstract**
 We present the pyKLIP-CHARIS post-processing pipeline, a Python library that reduces high contrast imaging data for the CHARIS integral field spectrograph used with the SCExAO project on the Subaru Telescope. The pipeline is a part of the pyKLIP package, a Python library dedicated to the reduction of direct imaging data of exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and discs. For PSF subtraction, the pyKLIP-CHARIS post-processing pipeline relies on the core algorithms implemented in pyKLIP but uses image registration and calibrations that are unique to CHARIS. We describe the pipeline procedures, calibration results, and capabilities in processing imaging data acquired via the angular differential imaging and spectral differential imaging observing techniques. We showcase its performance on extracting spectra of injected synthetic point sources as well as compare the extracted spectra from real data sets on HD 33632 and HR 8799 to results in the literature. The pipeline is a python-based complement to the SCExAO project supported, widely used (and currently IDL-based) CHARIS data post-processing pipeline (CHARIS DPP) and provides an additional approach to reducing CHARIS data and extracting calibrated planet spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 The total-to-selective extinction ratio, Rv, is a key parameter for tracing the properties of interstellar dust, as it directly determines the variation of the extinction curve with wavelength. By utilizing accurate color excess measurements from the optical to the mid-infrared range, we have derived Rv values for approximately 3 million stars from the LAMOST data release 7 (DR7) using a forward modeling technique. This extensive dataset enables us to construct a comprehensive two-dimensional Rv map of the Milky Way within the LAMOST footprint at a spatial resolution of ~27.5arcmin. Based on reliable sightlines of E(B-V) > 0.1, we find that Rv exhibits a Gaussian distribution centered around 3.25 with a standard deviation of 0.25. The spatial variability of Rv in the Galactic disk exhibits a wide range, spanning from small scales within individual molecular clouds to large scales up to kiloparsecs. A striking correlation is observed between the distribution of Rv and molecular clouds. Notably, we observe lower Rv values within the regions of nearby molecular clouds compared to their surrounding areas. Furthermore, we have investigated the relationships between Rv and various parameters, including dust temperature, dust emissivity spectral index, column density of atomic and molecular hydrogen, as well as their ratios and the gas-to-dust ratio. We find that these relationships vary with the level of extinction. These analyses provide new insights into the properties and evolution of dust grains in diverse interstellar environments and also hold significant importance for achieving accurate extinction corrections.
#### A study of the stellar photosphere-hydrogen ionization front interaction  in $δ$ Scuti stars
 - **Authors:** Mami Deka, Shashi M. Kanbur, Sukanta Deb, Susmita Das

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.04122
 - **Abstract**
 Pulsating variable $\delta$ Scuti stars are intermediate-mass stars with masses in the range of $1-3$ $M_{\odot}$ and spectral types between $A2$ and $F2$. They can be found at the intersection of the Cepheid instability strip with the main sequence. They can be used as astrophysical laboratories to test theories of stellar evolution and pulsation. In this contribution, we investigate the observed period-colour and amplitude-colour (PCAC) relations at maximum/mean/minimum light of Galactic bulge and Large Magellanic Cloud $\delta$ Scuti stars for the first time and test the hydrogen ionization front (HIF)-photosphere interaction theory using the MESA- RSP code. The PCAC relations, as a function of pulsation phase, are crucial probes of the structure of the outer stellar envelope and provide insight into the physics of stellar pulsation and evolution. The observed behaviour of the $\delta$ Scuti PCAC relations is consistent with the theory of the interaction between the HIF and the stellar photosphere.
#### A multiphase study of classical Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds-  Models and Observations

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents the study of multiphase relations of classical Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds for short periods (log P < 1) and long periods (log P > 1). From the analysis, it has been found that the multiphase relations obtained using the models as well as observations are highly dynamic with pulsational phase. The multiphase relations for short and long periods are found to display contrasting behaviour for both LMC and SMC. It has been observed that the multiphase relations obtained using the models agree better with the observations in the PC plane in most phases in comparison to the PL plane. Multiphase relations obtained using the models display a clear distinction among different convection sets in most phases. Comparison of models and observations in the multiphase plane is one way to test the models with the observations and to constrain the theory of stellar pulsation.
#### Investigating a Global Collapsing Hub-Filament Cloud G326.611+0.811

 - **Abstract**
 We present the dynamics study toward the G326.611+0.811 (G326) hub-filament-system (HFS) cloud using the new APEX observations of both $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O (J = 2-1). The G326 HFS cloud constitutes a central hub and at least four hub-composing filaments that are divided into a major branch of filaments (F1, and F2) and a side branch (F3-F5). The cloud holds ongoing high-mass star formation as characterised by three massive dense clumps (i.e., 370-1100 $M_{\odot}$ and 0.14-0.16 g cm$^{-2}$ for C1-C3) with the high clump-averaged mass infalling rates ($>10^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) within in the major filament branch, and the associated point sources bright at 70 $\mu$m typical of young protostars. Along the five filaments, the velocity gradients are found in both $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O (J = 2-1) emission, suggesting that the filament-aligned gravitational collapse toward the central hub (i.e., C2) is being at work for high-mass star formation therein. Moreover, a periodic velocity oscillation along the major filament branch is revealed in both $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O (J = 2-1) emission with a characteristic wavelength of $\sim$3.5 pc and an amplitude of $\sim$0.31-0.38 km s$^{-1}$. We suggest that this pattern of velocity oscillation in G326 could arise from the clump-forming gas motions induced by gravitational instability. Taking into account the prevalent velocity gradients, the fragmentation of the major branch of filaments, and the ongoing collapse of the three massive dense clumps, it is indicative that G326 is a HFS undergoing global collapse.
#### High-resolution APEX/LAsMA $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO (3-2) observation of  the G333 giant molecular cloud complex : II. Survival and gravitational  collapse of dense gas structures under feedback

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the physical properties of gas structures under feedback in the G333 complex using data of the 13CO (3-2) line in the LAsMA observation. We used the Dendrogram algorithm to identify molecular gas structures based on the integrated intensity map of the 13CO (3-2) emission, and extracted the average spectra of all structures to investigate their velocity components and gas kinematics. We derive the column density ratios between different transitions of the 13CO emission pixel-by-pixel, and find the peak values N(2-1)/N(1-0) ~ 0.5, N(3-2)/N(1-0) ~ 0.3, N(3-2)/N(2-1) ~ 0.5. These ratios can also be roughly predicted by RADEX for an average H$_2$ volume density of ~ 4.2 * 10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$. A classical virial analysis does not reflect the true physical state of the identified structures, and we find that external pressure from the ambient cloud plays an important role in confining the observed gas structures. For high column density structures, velocity dispersion and density show a clear correlation, while for low column density structures they do not, indicating the contribution of gravitational collapse to the velocity dispersion. For both leaf and branch structures, $\sigma-N*R$ always has a stronger correlation compared to $\sigma-N$ and $\sigma-R$. The scaling relations are stronger, and have steeper slopes when considering only self-gravitating structures, which are the structures most closely associated with the Heyer-relation. Although the feedback disrupting the molecular clouds will break up the original cloud complex, the substructures of the original complex can be reorganized into new gravitationally governed configurations around new gravitational centers. This process is accompanied by structural destruction and generation, and changes in gravitational centers, but gravitational collapse is always ongoing.
#### MAXI J0637-430: A Possible Candidate for Bulk Motion Comptonization?

 - **Abstract**
 The transient Galactic black hole candidate MAXI J0637-430 went through an outburst in 2019--20 for the very first time. This outburst was active for almost 6 months from November 2019 to May 2020. We study the spectral properties of this source during that outburst using archival data from NICER, Swift, and NuSTAR satellites/instruments. We have analyzed the source during 6 epochs on which simultaneous NICER--NuSTAR and Swift/XRT--NuSTAR data were available. Using both phenomenological and physical model fitting approaches, we analyzed the spectral data in the broad $0.7-70$ keV energy band. We first used a combination of disk blackbody with power-law, disk blackbody with broken power-law, and disk blackbody with power-law and bmc models. For a better understanding of the accretion picture, e.g., understanding how the accretion rates change with the changing size of the perceived Compton cloud, we used the two-component advective flow (TCAF) model with broken power-law, TCAF with power-law and bmc models. For last 3 epochs, the diskbb+power-law and TCAF models were able to spectrally fit the data for acceptable $\chi^2/DOF$. However, for the first 3 epochs, we needed an additional component to fit spectra for acceptable $\chi^2/DOF$. From our analysis, we reported about the possible presence of another component during these first 3 epochs when the source was in the high soft state. This additional component in this state is best described by the bulk motion Comptonization phenomenon. From the TCAF model fitting, we estimated the average mass of the source as $8.1^{+1.3}_{-2.7}~M_\odot$.

 - **Abstract**
 Tension remains between the observed and modeled properties of substellar objects, but objects in binary orbits, with known dynamical masses can provide a way forward. HD 72946 B is a recently imaged brown dwarf companion to the nearby, solar type star. We achieve $\sim100~\mu\mathrm{as}$ relative astrometry of HD 72946 B in the K-band using VLTI/GRAVITY, unprecedented for a benchmark brown dwarf. We fit an ensemble of measurements of the orbit using orbitize! and derive a strong dynamical mass constraint $\mathrm{M_B}=69.5\pm0.5~\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$ assuming a strong prior on the host star mass $\mathrm{M_A}=0.97\pm0.01~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ from an updated stellar analysis. We fit the spectrum of the companion to a grid of self-consistent BT-Settl-CIFIST model atmospheres, and perform atmospheric retrievals using petitRADTRANS. A dynamical mass prior only marginally influences the sampled distribution on effective temperature, but has a large influence on the surface gravity and radius, as expected. The dynamical mass alone does not strongly influence retrieved pressure-temperature or cloud parameters within our current retrieval setup. Independent of cloud prescription and prior assumptions, we find agreement within $\pm2\,\sigma$ between the C/O ratio of the host ($0.52\pm0.05)$ and brown dwarf ($0.43$ to $0.63$), as expected from a molecular cloud collapse formation scenario, but our retrieved metallicities are implausibly high ($0.6-0.8$) in light of an excellent agreement of the data with the solar abundance model grid. Future work on our retrieval framework will seek to resolve this tension. Additional study of low surface-gravity objects is necessary to assess the influence of a dynamical mass prior on atmospheric analysis.
#### The evolution and impact of 3000 Msol stars in the early Universe

 - **Abstract**
 We present evolutionary models of massive, accreting population III stars with constant and variable accretion rates until the end of silicon burning, with final masses of 1000 - 3000 Msol. In all our models, after the core-hydrogen burning phase, the star expands towards the red side of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram where it spends the rest of its evolution. During core helium burning, the models exhibit an outer convective envelope as well as many large intermediate convective zones. These intermediate zones allow for strong internal mixing to occur which enriches the surface in helium. The effect of increasing metallicity at a constant accretion rate of 1e-3 Msol/yr shows an increase in lifetime, final mass and distribution of helium in the envelope. Our fiducial model with mass of 3000 Msol has a final surface helium abundance of 0.74 with 9% of its total mass or 50% of the core mass below Gamma1 < 4/3 at the end of core silicon burning. If the collapse of the core is accompanied by the ejection of the envelope above the carbon-oxygen core, this could have a significant impact on the chemical evolution of the surroundings and subsequent stellar generations. The model has has a final log(N/O) ~ 0.45, above the lower limit in the recently detected high-redshift galaxy GN-z11. We discuss the impact of a single 3000 Msol on chemical, mechanical and radiative feedback, and present directions for future work.
