 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way (MW) is a barred spiral galaxy shaped by tidal interactions with its satellites. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy (Sgr) are the dominant influences at the present day. This paper presents a suite of four 10^9 particle N-body simulations, illustrating the response of the MW's stellar disc to the close approach of the LMC and the merger of Sgr into the MW. The suite is intended to provide a resource for others to study the complex interactions between the MW and its satellites independently and combined, in comparison to an isolated disc control simulation. Such high resolution simulations are vital to understand the kinematics and morphology of the MW taking into account the effects of each satellite. In our preliminary analysis, we find that the influences from the LMC and Sgr on the MW's disc appear distinct, additive and separable within our tailored simulations. Notably, the corrugations induced by Sgr reproduce the large radial velocity wave seen in the data Eilers+20. Overall, our findings emphasise the need to include both satellites when modelling the present-day state of the MW structure and kinematics.

 - **Abstract**
 Our understanding of Solar System evolution is closely tied to interpretations of asteroid composition, particularly the M-class asteroids. These asteroids were initially thought to be the exposed cores of differentiated planetesimals, a hypothesis based on their spectral similarity to iron meteorites. However, recent astronomical observations have revealed hydration on their surface through the detection of 3-$\mu$m absorption features associated with OH and potentially H2O. We present evidence of hydration due mainly to OH on asteroid (16) Psyche, the largest M-class asteroid, using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) spanning 1.1 - 6.63 $\mu$m. Our observations include two detections of the full 3-$\mu$m feature associated with OH and H2O resembling those found in CY-, CH-, and CB-type carbonaceous chondrites, and no 6-$\mu$m feature uniquely associated with H2O across two observations. We observe 3-$\mu$m depths of between 4.3 and 6% across two observations, values consistent with hydrogen abundance estimates on other airless bodies of 250 - 400 ppm. We place an upper limit of 39 ppm on the water abundance from the standard deviation around the 6-$\mu$m feature region. The presence of hydrated minerals suggests a complex history for Psyche. Exogenous sources of OH-bearing minerals could come from hydrated impactors. Endogenous OH-bearing minerals would indicate a composition more similar to E-or P-class asteroids. If the hydration is endogenous, it supports the theory that Psyche originated beyond the snow line and later migrated to the outer main belt.
#### Shock cooling emission from explosions of massive stars: III. Blue Super Giants

 - **Abstract**
 Light emission in the first hours and days following core-collapse supernovae is dominated by the escape of photons from the expanding shock-heated envelope. In preceding papers, we provided a simple analytic description of the time-dependent luminosity, $L$, and color temperature, $T_{\rm col}$, as well as of the small ($\simeq10\%$) deviations of the spectrum from blackbody at low frequencies, $h\nu< 3T_{\rm col}$, and of `line dampening' at $h\nu> 3T_{\rm col}$, for explosions of red supergiants (RSGs) with convective polytropic envelopes (without significant circum-stellar medium). Here, we extend our work to provide similar analytic formulae for explosions of blue supergiants with radiative polytropic envelopes. The analytic formulae are calibrated against a large set of spherically symmetric multi-group (frequency-dependent) calculations for a wide range of progenitor parameters (mass, radius, core/envelope mass ratios) and explosion energies. In these calculations we use the opacity tables we constructed (and made publicly available), that include the contributions of bound-bound and bound-free transitions. They reproduce the numeric $L$ and $T_{\rm col}$ to within 10\% and 5\% accuracy, and the spectral energy distribution to within $\sim20-40\%$. The accuracy is similar to that achieved for RSG explosions.
#### A global view on star formation: The GLOSTAR Galactic plane survey. XI. Radio source catalog IV: $2^\circ < \ell < 28^\circ$, $36^\circ < \ell < 60^\circ$ and $|b| < 1^\circ$

 - **Abstract**
 The GLOSTAR survey studies star formation with the VLA and the Effelsberg 100m telescope in the Galactic plane (-2d<l<60d; |b|<1d) and the Cygnus X region with unprecedented sensitivity in both flux density (~50uJy/beam) and the capability of detecting emission with angular scales in the range from 1" to the largest radio structures in the Galaxy. We provide a complete GLOSTAR-VLA D-configuration radio source catalog for the covered part of the Galactic disk. A catalog for the pilot region (28d<l<36d) has been published in a previous paper and here we present the complementary catalog for the area within 2d<l<28d, 36d<l<60d and |b|<1d. Observations were taken with the VLA in a 4-8GHz band to image 100 degrees$^2$ of the inner Galactic disk at a reference frequency of 5.8GHz, using 260h of telescope time. We determined spectral indices inside the observed band and in the frequency range 1.4-5.8GHz by complementing our results with those from the THOR survey (1-2GHz). The final images have an angular resolution of 18" and an average sensitivity of 123uJy/beam. The sensitivity is better (~60uJy/beam) in areas free of extended emission. The Galactic disk catalog presented in this work, consists of 11211 radio sources. Of these, 1965 are known large-scale structure sources such as star-forming region complexes, well-known SNRs, SNR candidates or parts thereof. The remaining 9227 are discrete individual sources. Source parameters, namely flux densities, sizes, spectral indices, and classifications are reported. We identify 769 HII region candidates, 359 are newly classified as such. The mean value of spectral indices of 225 HII regions is 0.14$\pm$0.02, consistent with most of them emitting optically thin thermal radio emission. Combining our results with the previously published catalog of the pilot region, the final GLOSTAR-VLA D-configuration catalog contains 12981 radio sources.
#### Neutrino Halo profiles: HR-DEMNUni simulation analysis

 - **Abstract**
 Using the high-resolution HR-DEMNUni simulations, we computed neutrino profiles within virialized dark matter haloes. These new high-resolution simulations allowed us to revisit fitting formulas proposed in the literature and provided updated fitting parameters that extend to less massive haloes and lower neutrino masses than previously in the literature, in accordance with new cosmological limits. The trend we observe for low neutrino masses is that, for dark matter halo masses below $\sim 4\times10^{14}$$h^{-1}M_\odot$, the presence of the core becomes weaker and the profile over the whole radius is closer to a simple power law. We also characterized the neutrino density profile dependence on the solid angle within clustered structures: a forward-backward asymmetry larger than 10% was found when comparing the density profiles from neutrinos along the direction of motion of cold dark matter particles within the same halo. In addition, we looked for neutrino wakes around halo centres produced by the peculiar motion of the halo itself. Our results suggest that the wakes effect is observable in haloes with masses greater than $3\times10^{14}$ $h^{-1}M_\odot$ where a mean displacement of $0.06$\hmpc was found.

 - **Abstract**
 The thermal and magnetic histories of planetesimals provide unique insights into the formation and evolution of Earth's building blocks. These histories can be gleaned from meteorites by using numerical models to translate measured properties into planetesimal behaviour. In this paper, we present a new 1D planetesimal thermal evolution and dynamo generation model. This magnetic field generation model is the first of a differentiated, mantled planetesimal that includes both mantle convection and non-eutectic core solidification. We have improved fundamental aspects of mantle heat transport by including a more detailed viscosity model and stagnant lid convection parametrisations consistent with internal heating. We have also added radiogenic heating from $^{60}Fe$ in the metallic Fe-FeS core. Additionally, we implement a combined thermal and compositional buoyancy flux, as well as the latest magnetic field scaling laws to predict magnetic field strengths during the planetesimal's thermal evolution until core solidification is complete. We illustrate the consequences of our model changes with an example run for a 500 km radius planetesimal. These effects include more rapid erosion of core thermal stratification and longer duration of mantle convection compared to previous studies. The additional buoyancy from core solidification has a marginal effect on dynamo strength, but for some initial core sulfur contents it can prevent cessation of the dynamo when mantle convection ends. Our model can be used to investigate the effects of individual parameters on dynamo generation and constrain properties of specific meteorite parent bodies. Combined, these updates mean this model can predict the most reliable and complete magnetic field history for a planetesimal to date, so is a valuable tool for deciphering planetesimal behaviour from meteorite properties.
