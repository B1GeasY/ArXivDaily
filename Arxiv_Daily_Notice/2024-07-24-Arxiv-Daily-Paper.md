 - **Abstract**
 NGC~6558 is a low-galactic latitude globular cluster projected in the direction of the Galactic bulge. Due to high reddening, this region presents challenges in deriving accurate parameters, which require meticulous photometric analysis. We present a combined analysis of near-infrared and optical photometry from multi-epoch high-resolution images collected with Gemini-South/GSAOI+GeMS (in the $J$ and $K_S$ filters) and HST/ACS (in the F606W and F814W filters). We aim to refine the fundamental parameters of NGC~6558, utilizing high-quality Gemini-South/GSAOI and HST/ACS photometries. Additionally, we intend to investigate its role in the formation of the Galactic bulge. We studied the impact of two differential reddening corrections on the age derivation. When removing as much as possible the Galactic bulge field star contamination, the isochrone fitting combined with synthetic colour-magnitude diagrams gives a distance of $8.41^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ kpc, an age of $13.0\pm 0.9$ Gyr, a reddening of E($B-V$)$\,\,=0.34\pm0.02$, and a total-to-selective coefficient R$_V = 3.2\pm0.2$ thanks to the simultaneous near-infrared$-$Optical synthetic colour-magnitude diagram fitting. The orbital parameters showed that NGC~6558 is confined whitin the inner Galaxy and it is not compatible with a bar-shape orbit, indicating that it is a bulge member. The old age of NGC~6558, combined with similar metallicity and a blue horizontal branch in the Galactic bulge, indicates that it is part of the moderately metal-poor globular clusters. Assembling the old and moderately metal-poor ([Fe/H]$\,\,\sim-1.1$) clusters in the Galactic bulge, we derived their age-metallicity relation with star formation stars at $13.6\pm0.2$ Gyr and effective yields of $\rho=0.007\pm0.009\,\, Z_\odot$ showing a chemical enrichment ten times faster than the ex-situ globular clusters branch.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrogen lines from forming planets are crucial for understanding planet formation. However, the number of planetary hydrogen line detections is still limited. Recent JWST/NIRSpec observations have detected Paschen and Brackett hydrogen lines at TWA 27 B (2M1207b). TWA 27 B is classified as a planetary-mass companison (PMC) rather than a planet due to its large mass ratio to the central object ($\approx 5 M_\mathrm{J}$ compared to $25 M_\mathrm{J}$). Nevertheless, TWA 27 B's hydrogen line emission is expected to be same as for planets, given its small mass. We aim to constrain the accretion properties and accretion geometry of TWA 27 B, contributing to our understanding of hydrogen line emission mechanism common to both PMCs and planets. We conduct spectral fitting of four bright hydrogen lines (Pa-$\alpha$, Pa-$\beta$, Pa-$\gamma$, Pa-$\delta$) with an accretion-shock emission model tailored for forming planets. We estimate the mass accretion rate at $\dot{M} \approx 3 \times 10^{-9}\, M_\mathrm{J}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ with our fiducial parameters, though this is subject to an uncertainty of up to factor of ten. Our analysis also indicates a dense accretion flow, $n\gtrsim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ just before the shock, implying a small accretion-shock filling factor $f_\mathrm{f}$ on the planetary surface ($f_\mathrm{f} \lesssim 5\times10^{-4}$). This finding suggests that magnetospheric accretion is occurring at TWA 27 B. Additionally, we carry out a comparative analysis of hydrogen-line emission color to identify the emission mechanism, but the associated uncertainties proved too large for definitive conclusions. This underscores the need for further high-precision observational studies to elucidate these emission mechanisms fully.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent results of the event horizon-scale images of M87* and Sagittarius A* from the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration show that strong magnetic fields are likely present around the central black holes (BHs) in these sources. Magnetically arrested disks (MADs), the end stage of magnetic flux saturation around BHs, are especially rich in horizon-scale physics due to the presence of powerful jets and magnetic flux eruptions that provide significant feedback on the accretion mechanism. Here, we present an overview of our current knowledge about the magnetic field evolution in numerical simulations of accreting BHs, focusing on jet launching, black hole-interstellar medium feedback, and black hole imaging of MADs. We find that misaligned MAD accretion flows seemingly exhibit jet ejection cycles that could produce flaring states in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei. Further, we show that advances in horizon-scale interferometric telescopes could identify disk misalignment by imaging the disk-jet connection region.

 - **Abstract**
 In close binary star systems, common envelope evolution may occur after a previous phase of mass transfer. Some isolated formation channels for double neutron star binaries suggest that the donor of common envelope evolution was the accretor of a previous phase of stable mass transfer. Accretion should substantially alter the structure of the donor, particularly by steepening the density gradient at the core-envelope interface and rejuvenating the star. We study the common envelope evolution of a donor that was the accretor of a previous phase of stable mass transfer and has a rejuvenated structure. We perform 3D hydrodynamics simulations of the common envelope evolution of a 18 $M_\odot$ supergiant with a 1.4 $M_\odot$ companion using rejuvenated and non-rejuvenated 1D stellar models for the donor. We compare the two simulations to characterize the effect of the rejuvenation on the outcome of the common envelope phase and the shape of the ejecta. We find that accounting for a previous phase of mass transfer reduces the duration of the inspiral phase by a factor of two, likely due to the different structure in the outer layers of the donor. In the rejuvenated case, the simulations show more equatorially concentrated and asymmetric ejecta, though both cases display evidence for the formation of a pressure-supported thick circumbinary disk. During the dynamical inspiral phase, the impact of rejuvenation on the unbinding of the envelope is unclear; we find that rejuvenation decreases the amount of unbound mass by 20$\%$ to 40$\%$ depending on the energy criterion used.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of the chemical composition of the interstellar medium (ISM) requires a strong synergy between laboratory astrophysics, modeling, and observations. In particular, astrochemical models have been developed for decades now and include an increasing number of processes studied in the laboratory or theoretically. These models follow the chemistry both in the gas phase and at the surface of interstellar grains. Since 2012, we have provided complete gas-phase chemical networks for astrochemical codes that can be used to model various environments of the ISM. Our aim is to introduce the new up-to-date astrochemical network kida.uva.2024 together with the ice chemical network and the fortran code to compute time dependent compositions of the gas, the ice surface, and the ice mantles under physical conditions relevant for the ISM. The gas-phase chemical reactions, as well as associated rate coefficients, included in kida.uva.2024 were carefully selected from the KIDA online database and represent the most recent values. The model predictions for cold core conditions and for when considering only gas-phase processes were computed as a function of time and compared to the predictions obtained with the previous version, kida.uva.2014. In addition, key chemical reactions were identified. The model predictions, including both gas and surface processes, were compared to the molecular abundances as observed in the cold core TMC1-CP. Many gas-phase reactions were revised or added to produce kida.uva.2024. The new model predictions are different by several orders of magnitude for some species. The agreement of this new model with observations in TMC-1 (CP) is, however, similar to the one obtained with the previous network.

 - **Abstract**
 The clouds have a great impact on Venus's energy budget and climate evolution, but its three-dimensional structure is still not well understood. Here we incorporate a simple Venus cloud physics scheme into a flexible GCM to investigate the three-dimensional cloud spatial variability. Our simulations show good agreement with observations in terms of the vertical profiles of clouds and H2SO4 vapor. H2O vapor is overestimated above the clouds due to efficient transport in the cloud region. The cloud top decreases as latitude increases, qualitatively consistent with Venus Express observations. The underlying mechanism is the combination of H2SO4 chemical production and meridional circulation. The mixing ratios of H2SO4 at 50-60 km and H2O vapors in the main cloud deck basically exhibit maxima around the equator, due to the effect of temperature's control on the saturation vapor mixing ratios of the two species. The cloud mass distribution is subject to both H2SO4 chemical production and dynamical transport and shows a pattern that peaks around the equator in the upper cloud while peaks at mid-high latitudes in the middle cloud. At low latitudes, H2SO4 and H2O vapors, cloud mass loading and acidity show semidiurnal variations at different altitude ranges, which can be validated against future missions. Our model emphasizes the complexity of the Venus climate system and the great need for more observations and simulations to unravel its spatial variability and underlying atmospheric and/or geological processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Close-in planets smaller than Neptune form two distinct populations composed of rocky super-Earths and sub-Neptunes that may host primordial H/He envelopes. The origin of the radius valley separating these two planet populations remains an open question and has been posited to emerge either directly from the planet formation process or via subsequent atmospheric escape. Multi-transiting systems that span the radius valley are known to be useful diagnostics of XUV-driven mass loss. Here, we extend this framework to test XUV-driven photoevaporation, core-powered mass loss, and an accretion-limited primordial radius valley model. Focusing on multi-transiting systems allows us to eliminate unobservable quantities that are shared within individual systems such as stellar XUV luminosity histories and the properties of the protoplanetary disk. We test each proposed radius valley emergence mechanism on all 221 known multi-transiting systems and calculate the minimum masses of the systems' enveloped planets to be consistent with the models. We compare our model predictions to 75 systems with measured masses and find that the majority of systems can be explained by any of the three proposed mechanisms. We also examine model consistency as a function of stellar mass and stellar metallicity but find no significant trends. More multi-transiting systems with mass characterizations are required before multi-transiting systems can serve as a viable diagnostic of radius valley emergence models. Our software for the model evaluations presented herein is available on GitHub and may be applied to future multi-transiting system discoveries.

 - **Abstract**
 Very massive stars are radiation pressure dominated. Before running out of viable nuclear fuel, they can reach a thermodynamic state where electron-positron pair-production robs them of radiation support, triggering their collapse. Thermonuclear explosion(s) in the core ensue. These have long been predicted to result in either repeated episodic mass loss (pulsational pair instability), which reduces the mass available to eventually form a black hole, or, if sufficient energy is generated, the complete unbinding of all stellar material in one single explosive episode (pair instability supernova), which leaves behind no black hole. Despite theoretical agreement among modelers, the wide variety of predicted signatures and the rarity of very high-mass stellar progenitors have so far resulted in a lack of observational confirmation. Nevertheless, because of the impact of pair instability evolution on black hole masses relevant to gravitational-wave astronomy, as well as the present and upcoming expanded capabilities of time-domain astronomy and high redshift spectroscopy, interest in these explosion remains high. We review the current understanding of pair instability evolution, with particular emphasis on the known uncertainties. We also summarize the existing claimed electromagnetic counterparts and discuss prospects for future direct and indirect searches.

 - **Abstract**
 The Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud is known for its high star formation activity. At its center lies the young massive star cluster R136, providing a significant amount of the energy that makes the nebula shine so brightly at many wavelengths. Recently, young massive star clusters have been suggested to also efficiently produce high-energy cosmic rays, potentially beyond PeV energies. Here, we report the detection of very-high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission from the direction of R136 with the High Energy Stereoscopic System, achieved through a multicomponent, likelihood-based modeling of the data. This supports the hypothesis that R136 is indeed a very powerful cosmic-ray accelerator. Moreover, from the same analysis, we provide an updated measurement of the $\gamma$-ray emission from 30 Dor C, the only superbubble detected at TeV energies presently. The $\gamma$-ray luminosity above $0.5\,\mathrm{TeV}$ of both sources is $(2-3)\times 10^{35}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. This exceeds by more than a factor of 2 the luminosity of HESS J1646$-$458, which is associated with the most massive young star cluster in the Milky Way, Westerlund 1. Furthermore, the $\gamma$-ray emission from each source is extended with a significance of $>3\sigma$ and a Gaussian width of about $30\,\mathrm{pc}$. For 30 Dor C, a connection between the $\gamma$-ray emission and the nonthermal X-ray emission appears likely. Different interpretations of the $\gamma$-ray signal from R136 are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 This study concerns an inventory of the gravitational force and tidal field induced by filaments, walls, cluster nodes and voids on Megaparsec scales and how they assemble and shape the Cosmic Web. The study is based on a N$_{\rm Part}=512^3$ $\Lambda$CDM dark matter only N-body simulation in a (300$h^{-1}$~Mpc)$^3$ box at $z=0$. We invoke the density field NEXUS+ multiscale morphological procedure to assign the appropriate morphological feature to each location. We then determine the contribution by each of the cosmic web components to the local gravitational and tidal forces. We find that filaments are, by far, the dominant dynamical component in the interior of filaments, in the majority of underdense void regions and in all wall regions. The gravitational influence of cluster nodes is limited, and they are only dominant in their immediate vicinity. The force field induced by voids is marked by divergent outflowing patterns, yielding the impression of a segmented volume in which voids push matter towards their boundaries. Voids manifest themselves strongly in the tidal field as a cellular tapestry that is closely linked to the multiscale cosmic web. However, even within the interior of voids, the dynamical influence of the surrounding filaments is stronger than the outward push by voids. Therefore, the dynamics of voids cannot be understood without taking into account the influence of the environment. We conclude that filaments constitute the overpowering gravitational agent of the cosmic web, while voids are responsible for the cosmic web's spatial organisation and hence of its spatial connectivity.
#### Spectroscopic analysis of the strongly lensed SN~Encore: Constraints on cosmic evolution of Type Ia supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Strong gravitational lensing magnifies the light from a background source, allowing us to study these sources in detail. Here, we study the spectra of a $z = 1.95$ lensed Type Ia supernova SN~Encore for its brightest Image A, taken 39 days apart. We infer the spectral age with template matching using the supernova identification (SNID) software and find the spectra to be at 29.0 $\pm 5.0$ and 37.4 $\pm 2.8$ rest-frame days post maximum respectively, consistent with separation in the observer frame after accounting for time-dilation. Since SNe~Ia measure dark energy properties by providing relative distances between low- and high-$z$ SNe, it is important to test for evolution of spectroscopic properties. Comparing the spectra to composite low-$z$ SN~Ia spectra, we find strong evidence for similarity between the local sample of SN~Encore. The line velocities of common SN~Ia spectral lines, Si II 6355 and Ca II NIR triplet are consistent with the distribution for the low-$z$ sample as well as other lensed SNe~Ia, e.g. iPTF16geu ($z = 0.409$) and SN~H0pe ($z = 1.78$). The consistency in SN~Ia spectra across cosmic time demonstrates the utility of using SNe~Ia in the very high-$z$ universe for dark energy inference. We also find that the spectra of SN~Encore match the predictions for explosion models very well. With future large samples of lensed SNe~Ia, spectra at such late phases will be important to distinguish between different explosion scenarios.
#### Magnetic Fields in Massive Star-forming Regions (MagMaR): Unveiling an Hourglass Magnetic Field in G333.46-0.16 using ALMA

 - **Abstract**
 The contribution of the magnetic field to the formation of high-mass stars is poorly understood. We report the high-angular resolution ($\sim0.3^{\prime\prime}$, 870 au) map of the magnetic field projected on the plane of the sky (B$_\mathrm{POS}$) towards the high-mass star forming region G333.46$-$0.16 (G333), obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 1.2 mm as part of the Magnetic Fields in Massive Star-forming Regions (MagMaR) survey. The B$_\mathrm{POS}$ morphology found in this region is consistent with a canonical ``hourglass'' which suggest a dynamically important field. This region is fragmented into two protostars separated by $\sim1740$ au. Interestingly, by analysing H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ ($J=3-2$) line emission, we find no velocity gradient over the extend of the continuum which is consistent with a strong field. We model the B$_\mathrm{POS}$, obtaining a marginally supercritical mass-to-flux ratio of 1.43, suggesting an initially strongly magnetized environment. Based on the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, the magnetic field strength towards G333 is estimated to be 5.7 mG. The absence of strong rotation and outflows towards the central region of G333 suggests strong magnetic braking, consistent with a highly magnetized environment. Our study shows that despite being a strong regulator, the magnetic energy fails to prevent the process of fragmentation, as revealed by the formation of the two protostars in the central region.
#### Robust Preference for Dynamical Dark Energy in DESI BAO and SN Measurements

 - **Abstract**
 Recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements released by DESI, when combined with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck and two different samples of Type Ia supernovae (Pantheon-Plus and DESY5) reveal a preference for Dynamical Dark Energy (DDE) characterized by a present-day quintessence-like equation of state that crossed into the phantom regime in the past. A core ansatz for this result is assuming a linear Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization $w(a) = w_0 + w_a (1-a)$ to describe the evolution of the DE equation of state (EoS). In this paper, we test if and to what extent this assumption impacts the results. To prevent broadening uncertainties in cosmological parameter inference and facilitate direct comparison with the baseline CPL case, we focus on 4 alternative well-known models that, just like CPL, consist of only two free parameters: the present-day DE EoS ($w_0$) and a parameter quantifying its dynamical evolution ($w_a$). We demonstrate that the preference for DDE remains robust regardless of the parameterization: $w_0$ consistently remains in the quintessence regime, while $w_a$ consistently indicates a preference for a dynamical evolution towards the phantom regime. This tendency is significantly strengthened by DESY5 SN measurements. By comparing the best-fit $\chi^2$ obtained within each DDE model, we notice that the linear CPL parameterization is not the best-fitting case. Among the models considered, the EoS proposed by Barboza and Alcaniz consistently leads to the most significant improvement.
